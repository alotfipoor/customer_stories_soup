        "company": "NE-XT Technologies",
        "content": "\nIn brief \n\nNE-XT Technologies\u2019 labor-intensive, manual reporting process relied on multiple spreadsheets and heavy time investment.\nThe company needed an easy, flexible solution for report creation and data analysis.\nWith Spreadsheet Server, NE-XT Technologies reduced the financial reporting process from 1-2 days to less than 5 minutes.\n\nFounded in 1971 as a two-man shop, NE-XT Technologies has grown over more than 50 years into a 200+ employee manufacturing company that uses innovative processes to manufacture complex, close tolerance, and precision-machined components and assemblies for applications in aerospace, defense, and other industrial OEMs. Using a solutions-based mindset and more than 100 CNC machines, NE-XT creates the highest quality products possible for its customers.\nUser-Friendly Report Creation\nWhen Rich Havighorst was named Chief Financial Officer at NE-XT Technologies in 2022, he described the business as a venture capital startup. While the company has grown exponentially, NE-XT prides itself on running leaner than its 200+ employees might suggest, keeping a relatively small administrative staff and no IT department.\nOne of the first things Havighorst did as CFO was to implement Epicor and Spreadsheet Server for unified data management and reporting. \u201cBefore the implementation, our process was basically taking a trial balance and manually mapping it up into the financial statements every month by using a bunch of VLOOKUP formulas,\u201d Havighorst explained. \u201cWe needed an easy, flexible solution for report creation and data analysis.\u201d\nHavighorst decided to implement Epicor and Spreadsheet Server together because Spreadsheet Server gave his team the user-friendly reporting process they needed. \u201cOne of the big disadvantages with Epicor alone was you still had to go back into the source system to research down into the transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the big benefits of Spreadsheet Server is that it can drill-down or drill-through to get to underlying data; it saves a ton of time in trying to understand what\u2019s rolling up.\u201d\n\u201cIf You Can Use Excel, You Can Use Spreadsheet Server\u201d \nThe main reason Havighorst chose to implement Spreadsheet Server alongside Epicor is its Excel compatibility. As an Excel add-in with seamless ERP integration, using Spreadsheet Server leverages your team\u2019s existing skill and comfort with Excel. Setup is quick and easy, and Havighorst\u2019s team is now able to generate financial statements and drill down to transaction data without ever leaving Excel.\nHavighorst realized early on that anyone with even a basic knowledge of Excel could successfully use Spreadsheet Server. For NE-XT\u2019s financial reporting needs, it came down to a single Excel formula. Spreadsheet Server allows you to build a query and save it to your ribbon in Excel. From there, you can access it at any time, for any report. From building reports to creating charts and pivot tables, \u201cone Excel formula drives it all,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you know this one formula, you can get pretty much any data you need.\u201d\nDrill-Down is a Favorite Feature \nThe feature Havighorst enjoys the most when working with Spreadsheet Server is the ability to drill down to transaction-level data in real time without leaving Excel. He loves being able to select the number he needs more information on, select drill down, and immediately see the transaction history tied to that number.\nEpicor data also automatically updates in Excel to enable real-time reporting. Havighorst\u2019s team now has the ability to drill down to transaction data to find and fix errors and inconsistencies. \u201cWhen I\u2019m closing the books and I want to look at what\u2019s in a charge, I don\u2019t need to go into Epicor. I can basically do it right from my spreadsheet and drill straight down into the charges one by one.\u201d\nDrill-down is available for both financial and non-financial data, making it a useful feature to track both financial transactions and inventory and logistics information. Being able to drill down to details like these without leaving Excel saves countless hours of work for Havighorst\u2019s team.\nNot Just for Finance\nSpreadsheet Server makes finance reporting quick and easy, but it extends far beyond that. NE-XT can use Spreadsheet Server for any kind of operational reporting the company needs, including physical inventory counts, updating standards, and creating DMT templates.\nAs the company continues to grow and expand, Havighorst is looking forward to taking advantage of Spreadsheet Server\u2019s distribution manager and expanding its use to the rest of his team. He plans to hire a controller and a dedicated IT person to be the main report creators, and to train more business users on the software so his team can continue making efficiency gains and delivering insightful analysis to the company.\nOutcome \nSpreadsheet Server allows NE-XT Technologies to automate previously manual processes, saving time and eliminating the potential for errors. A reporting process that once took days to complete now takes only minutes, allowing Havighorst and his team to focus on providing strategic analysis and business insights for continued growth.\n\u201cBefore Epicor and Spreadsheet Server, gathering the data and creating reports was a very manual, one- to two-day process. Now, I can generate financials in under 5 minutes, and immediately begin analysis.\u201d\nReady to learn more about how Spreadsheet Server can help you streamline your financial and operational reporting?

        "company": "Russell Standard",
        "content": "\nIn brief \n\nSpreadsheet-based budgeting and reporting processes were long and chaotic.\nSpreadsheet Server streamlined Excel reporting by providing a direct connection to ERP data.\nWith Bizview, Russell Standard was able to reduce its annual budgeting and planning timeline by a full 30 days.\n\nFounded in 1929 by Niles Russell, Russell Standard is a trusted leader in both the production and installation of pavement preservation materials. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, and serving clients from Pennsylvania to Alabama, the company\u2019s mission is to be the most respected partner in the region by serving team and customers alike like family. Russell Standard is committed to providing custom asphalt preservation solutions to a wide variety of customers in the roofing, sealing, pipe coating, and similar industries.\nExcel-Based Processes Made Planning a Lengthy Proposition\nWhen controller, Craig Schiebel, joined Russell Standard in 2008, he described the company\u2019s financial processes as \u201cpretty archaic,\u201d though they were evolving. Over the 15 years Schiebel has been with the company, Russell Standard\u2019s finance processes have continued to evolve. The company has implemented new technology solutions to improve its processes and create a better, more efficient budgeting and planning process.\nFifteen years ago, Russell Standard\u2019s financial reporting and planning were done entirely via Excel spreadsheets; it was a tedious, time-consuming, manual process that ate up a lot of resources. Shortly after Schiebel joined the company, it implemented a new ERP system, moving from Foundations to Viewpoint. This helped make financial reporting and planning easier, but the process remained manual and time-consuming.\nNot long after moving to Viewpoint, Russell Standard began using FRX for financial reporting, while all other reporting was still done with Excel. It wasn\u2019t a perfect solution, but it was an improvement. When Viewpoint made its reporting and budgeting solution available, Financial Manager, Russell Standard took full advantage. \u201cUntil we had Financial Manager, we weren\u2019t doing budgets,\u201d Scheibel said. \u201cWe were just working and seeing how things came out, so Financial Manager made a big difference.\u201d\nAs Russell Standard invested in new technologies to create efficiencies and improve processes, the company also invested in its people, hiring a data analyst who Schiebel described as \u201ca wizard in Excel.\u201d His team was able to create more reports using Excel but taking it to the next level was still a goal.\nIn 2016 the company got one step closer to achieving that goal when it moved from Financial Manager to Budget Accelerator and Spreadsheet Server from insightsoftware. \u201cThat was a step in the right direction for us,\u201d Schiebel said. \u201cWe could create reports that automatically link to our data and pull it in, which is something we couldn\u2019t do before.\u201d\nSpreadsheet Server and Budget Accelerator made Schiebel\u2019s reporting processes faster, more intuitive, and less error-prone, but budgeting and planning was still a long, spreadsheet-based process. With financial data spread across Russell Standard\u2019s various operations teams, collaboration, data aggregation, and analysis were still a huge drain on valuable finance team hours. Schiebel knew he needed a way to streamline the budgeting process to drive more value from his team and enable agile decision-making.\nBizview Was a Game-Changer\nAfter several years using Budget Accelerator and Spreadsheet Server, Russell Standard had an established and successful relationship with insightsoftware, and Schiebel was invited to join a user group to learn about Bizview and its budgeting and planning capabilities. \u201cI got to see what Bizview could do for our budgeting and planning needs, and it obviously worked to get me interested in the product,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so impressed with Bizview\u2019s potential that I made a presentation to my boss, the CFO, showing him what it could do and why I thought we needed to invest in it. He is very supportive of using technology to improve our processes, so he was on board.\u201d\nBizview boasts several features that were of particular interest to Russell Standard.\n\nAutomated Workflows \u2013 Bizview\u2019s built-in workflows would automatically notify Russell Standard stakeholders of their planning responsibilities, streamlining collaboration and taking the confusion out of the budgeting process.\nExecutive Dashboards \u2013 With Bizview\u2019s reporting dashboards, Russell Standard\u2019s executive team would be able to quickly see a snapshot of the company\u2019s financial plans and reports, saving time and improving communications with leadership.\nIntegrated Budgeting and Planning \u2013 With managers from all teams contributing to the budgeting process, Bizview would allow Russell Standard to develop integrated, accurate plans across business units in less time and with less stress.\nConsolidated Planning and Reporting \u2013 Bizview\u2019s robust and agile planning capabilities would allow Russell Standard to combine Spreadsheet Server and Budget Accelerator\u2019s functionalities in a single application, shrinking reporting cycles and resource usage.\n\nWith his executive team on-board, Schiebel moved forward with Bizview implementation and had it up and running in time for the 2022 budgeting season.\nBizview Streamlined Budgeting Season by a Full Month\nSchiebel\u2019s team went into the 2022 budgeting season expecting it to look a lot like previous years\u2019 budgeting seasons. For Russell Standard, that meant a four- to five-month process running from October through mid-February; involving not just the accounting team, but also the heads of every department in every location the business operates.\nSchiebel was optimistic that Bizview would make the process easier and more streamlined for everyone involved in the budgeting process \u2013 especially the plant managers and operations managers who contributed from across the business. But because this was the first budgeting season using Bizview, he was prepared for it to be as long and arduous as usual.\nHowever, Bizview more than lived up to its potential. The software\u2019s workflows, pre-built reporting templates, and Excel-like interface made coordinating the planning process across business locations and departments a much easier and faster prospect. After using Bizview for the first time in 2022, Schiebel\u2019s team decided to push back the 2023 budgeting season launch from October to November, shaving weeks from the process.\n\u201cBizview enabled us to cut a whole month off the budgeting process.\u201d\nWorkflow Control\nFor Schiebel\u2019s team, Bizview\u2019s built-in workflows have been the biggest help to their planning process. As he explained, \u201cBudget Accelerator had no workflow, so we didn\u2019t know where the budget was in the process. We didn\u2019t know who was working on it, whether it was done or not. Everything was done via email, text, or phone calls, so you had to trust that your collaborators weren\u2019t going to make changes halfway through the process.\u201d\nBizview has streamlined budgeting and planning processes by taking the guesswork out of collaboration. Its workflows are easy to use, making it easy to control budget entries and approvals, comment on plans in progress directly within the input forms, and see where each contributor is in the process. \u201cNow, with workflow in Bizview, once a contributor submits something they can\u2019t change it until it gets pushed back to them. It really helps reduce the chance for error. It\u2019s made life a lot easier for my team.\u201d\nConsolidated Planning and Reporting\nBizview allowed Russell Standard to combine the functionalities of Budget Accelerator and Spreadsheet Server in a single application. While the company kept Spreadsheet Server for ad-hoc reporting and analysis, it was able to eliminate Budget Accelerator. Bizview provided the single source of truth Schiebel\u2019s team needed to:\n\nCreate a repeatable, standard planning process that automatically reflected changes in the ERP system\nTake control of the budgeting process by using embedded analytics to monitor performance and detect trends\nTrack and compare previous budget figures with built-in version control\nBuild dashboards with snapshot data views that leadership can access on-demand for more informed decision-making\n\n\u201cBudget Accelerator was great in certain ways, but the workflow wasn\u2019t there, and we couldn\u2019t make executive dashboards with it. There was definitely some clunkiness to it,\u201d Schiebel said. \u201cBizview let us incorporate what we use Spreadsheet Server and Budget Accelerator for into one program and gave us the ability to have dashboards and analytics ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice for leadership to be able to make decisions.\u201d\nLooking Ahead: Creating Executive Dashboards\nSchiebel is excited about the possibilities Bizview presents for Rusell Standard\u2019s budgeting and planning growth. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the development phase; 2022 was all about getting the basic budgeting and reporting down, and now we\u2019re ready to refine and create more efficiency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just learning curve for us at this point. We\u2019ve already made some tweaks to some of our input forms based on feedback from the operations managers.\u201d\nAfter having reduced the budgeting and planning process by a full month, the next goal is to streamline executive communications with dashboards. \u201cWe\u2019re now creating dashboards in Bizview, which are under review by our leadership. Once the dashboards are approved, it will be an automatic distribution that goes directly to key stakeholders. I expect it to save my staff a lot of time in producing our reports.\u201d\nTo learn more about all that Bizview can do for your organization, read our whitepaper on transitioning from manual to modern planning processes.\n"

        "company": "Greenclose Hotels",
        "content": "\nIn brief\n\nGreenclose Hotels struggled with manual processes, leaving its finance team without the tools to do their jobs quickly and efficiently.\nSpreadsheet Server shaved off over 60% of its reporting cycle, leaving the company with more time for value-added analysis.\nThanks to automation technology, the company is in a better position to correctly gauge the health of the business.\n\nGreenclose Hotels is a provider of homegrown hospitality in countryside and coastal settings throughout Europe. Committed to making guests feel at home wherever they are, Greenclose Hotels stretch from the stunning scenery of North Wales to the beauty and diversity of the New Forest.\nGreenclose Hotels prides itself in exceeding expectations while providing exceptional food and drink in luxurious surroundings. The customer comes first at Greenclose Hotels, providing respect, commitment and professionalism, backed up by a firm belief in environmental and ethical principles.\nDragged Down by Time-Consuming Processes\nWhen Mike Lashmar joined Greenclose Hotels as Finance and Commercial Director last year, he encountered outdated processes and systems. Running data for management reports was prepared manually in Excel. \u201cIt took quite a long time to get any management information, and it was so linked down the chain it wasn\u2019t actionable,\u201d Mike said.\nAt the time, Mike was part of a team of four people. Because their processes weren\u2019t automated, it would take a month or more to run period-end reports. \u201cMany hotel groups take 3-5 working days to generate reports, so we were behind the industry standard,\u201d Mike continued. \u201cHotels are 24/7 businesses that don\u2019t stop. It\u2019s a continuous process. If you get data and insight late, you\u2019re already behind.\u201d\nManual reporting runs the risk of human error, a detail Mike was keenly aware of. \u201cManual reporting is a huge risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a finance director presenting error-prone data to the board, you\u2019ve ruined your credibility.\u201d\nWeighed down by manual processes, Mike found he didn\u2019t have the right tools to do his job.\nIntroducing Spreadsheet Server\nGreenclose houses its data in NetSuite, but ERP-native reporting can be complicated and require specific knowledge of the system. Mike set out to find a solution that would enable him and his team to streamline processes, speed up reporting cycles, and access more accurate data without the need for advanced knowledge. He sought out technology that would provide him with:\n\nA single source of truth\nEase of use\nReal-time data\nGreater visibility into supply records and customer records\n\nAfter an in-depth search, Mike found Spreadsheet Server, which provides hotel data and finance teams with access to live data directly in Excel for reporting and analysis. Spreadsheet Server offered Greenclose the self-service capabilities it needed to speed up and modernize its reporting process. Spreadsheet Server offered Greenclose Hotels:\n\nFast installation and implementation so Mike\u2019s team could hit the ground running\nA user-friendly Excel interface to enable even non-technical users\nDeep, transactional-level drilldowns to enable management investigation of reporting\n\nResults\nSpreadsheet Server empowered Greenclose Hotels to:\n\nSave up to 20 days off Greenclose Hotels\u2019 reporting cycle\nIncrease the accuracy of its reports\nWork in a familiar, Excel-based format\n\nDoing More with Less\nWith Spreadsheet Server, the team at Greenclose Hotels was able to shave weeks\u2019 worth of work from their reporting cycle, enabling them to do more with the resources they already had. The impact was staggering. Where it once took them a whole month, now the team can generate month-end reports in just 10 days. \u201cWith software systems, you buy something from a sales team and during implementation, you find out what you\u2019ve really got,\u201d Mike explained. \u201cBut Spreadsheet Serves does exactly what it says on the tin.\u201d\nThe investment wasn\u2019t something Mike took lightly. \u201cWe think really carefully about where we spend our money at the moment because it\u2019s a tough market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a cost-of-living crisis where people are spending money more conscientiously. The impact of inflation has been huge with the cost of food and beverages. It\u2019s tough at the top and at the middle. Being able to report quickly and understanding our numbers better than our competitors have been crucial.\u201d\nDrilling Down into Data\nWith the help of Spreadsheet Server, Mike can drill down into accounts, allowing him and his team to report more quickly, more accurately, and with greater detail. \u201cOur numbers are much more credible. We can get more value out of our data,\u201d Mike said.\nIt has also helped the company tackle soaring inflation and market instability. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly restless to do better,\u201d Mike said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough world out there with costs going through the roof and people conserving their money. We now have the ability to put a microscope on any P&L we want to.\u201d\nMike\u2019s team can now better understand costs with a single click. Before, they had to find the relevant code within their ERP, then manually find invoices. Ultimately, they achieved significant time savings by streamlining this process. This allows them to spend more time on value-added analysis. \u201cSpreadsheet Server has taken a huge burden off keeping score,\u201d Mike explained. \u201cIt\u2019s now about what we can action.\u201d\nDistribution Manager \nAnother of Spreadsheet Server\u2019s features that Greenclose Hotels uses frequently is Distribution Manager. Distribution Manager is a Spreadsheet Server add on that automatically saves and distributes files on a schedule you set, ensuring recipients will always receive the reports they need on time.\n\u201cWith Distribution Manager, we can send the restaurant P&L easily and separately in the click of a button,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThe ability to distribute quickly to anyone in any format has been a huge advantage.\u201d\nThe hospitality industry thrives on accessible, accurate data. After implementing Spreadsheet Server, Greenclose Hotels has sped up its reporting process significantly while enjoying access to the most up-to-date information straight from NetSuite. In the future, Greenclose Hotels looks forward to expanding its use of Spreadsheet Server for even more time savings on its month-end reporting processes.\n"

It relies on the right mix of hardware and software to protect the property, people, and information inside from possible intruders or unusual activity. That\u2019s where Brivo comes in.\nBrivo specializes in cloud-based access control and security platforms that help property owners and security teams regulate access. These systems combine hardware\u2014such as badges, readers, and video cameras\u2014and access control with credentials provided in cards, key fobs, biometrics, or mobile apps. As individuals enter a building, security systems identify their credentials and then determine whether they are authorized to enter.\nOne of the challenges Brivo had with their platform was a lack of in-depth reporting options. Their customers couldn\u2019t access deeper levels of their data to identify potential problems or risks. They wanted a way for their customers to query their data, sort it, and visualize it to quickly understand it to make informed decisions about their security.\nAlso, with increasing emphasis on physical security and cybersecurity, Brivo\u2019s customers needed an efficient approach to quickly identify critical information, such as a security breach or other anomaly. They needed to know what data to focus on without reviewing multiple video screens. This need was particularly important for larger enterpriseswith security teams that had to monitor greater volumes of people and physical locations.\n\u00a0\nIn Search of Deeper and Actionable Analytics\nTo meet their challenges, Brivo committed to finding a way to provide predictive analytics and trend analysis for their customers to visualize, analyze, and understand their data. They required a solution with the ability to:\n\nGive large enterprise and smaller customers deeper and actionable analytics with more on-demand reporting.\nProvide insights within their application to offer greater value and service to their enterprise users.\nEmpower their small business users with better insights and visibility into their data needs.\nScale to meet the needs of a single location while providing vast analytics capabilities for multiple locations, helping security teams find the largest security holes.\n\nBrivo required an intuitive, easy-to-use user interface (UI) for their diverse set of users to handle large data sets and quickly pinpoint any abnormal activity. It had to be simple enough so that a receptionist or security guard could use it to monitor one or two doors. Yet, it had to be powerful for a manager or director of several sites to monitor security staff responsiveness to alerts.\n\n\u201cWe have millions of events that happen every hour. How do you find a tool that can work with that size of data and that has the data science background to manipulate the data? The insightsoftware platform offered a fast solution that we could white label, keeping it as part of the same platform, while making it usable by someone who wasn\u2019t an expert in analytics.\u201d\n\u2013 Jeff Nielsen, Chief Technology Officer, Brivo\n\nIf an intruder were to tailgate through an entry, force a door open, or access a building outside of regular working hours, Brivo requires the platform to capture the event and alert the correct employee. By having this information, security teams could avoid unpredictable events that, although they might not appear serious at the time, can have the potential for severe outcomes (known as black swan events).\nJeff Nielsen, Chief Technology Officer for Brivo, didn\u2019t want an analytics plug-in or to add a layer on top of their current, third-generation platform. He wanted a way to seamlessly integrate analytics capabilities, reimagining their enterprise-level platform into a world-class security solution.\nA Game-changing Partnership to Strengthen Building Access Control\nAfter evaluating several dierent analytics and BI tools, Brivo chose to partner with insightsoftware for their scalable embedded analytics platform. Brivo was sold on the platform\u2019s abilities to integrate right into their existing solution and to analyze data through a simple, easy-to-use UI. Plus, they found the technical support and professional services teams easy to work with.\nNielsen says, \u201cThe biggest reason we went with Logi Symphony is that we could host it ourselves; it integrated well with our platform. The interface was appealing for our non-data users to navigate. We also liked the performance characteristics for working with large data sets.\u201d\nBrivo is using the insightsoftware platform primarily for their enterprise-tier customers to access their Brivo Data Explorer tool. This tool connects the insightsoftware platform to their data warehouse and its data lake and filters for each individual customer. By providing the ability to access real-time embedded analytics, their customers can ensure the right people receive the right reporting.\nWith the Data Explorer tool, security team members who have approved access to the system can explore various scenarios to see whether security should follow up on them. For example, they might review event data, filtering out normal events, to locate unusual activity from the previous week that they were unaware of. They can also focus on error-type events to identify any trends and whether they\u2019re associated with a single door, a single site, or a specific day of the week.\nBrivo prides itself on the breadth of their data. The access credentials alone come with a plethora of information, such as user and site data, including the number of doors or readers. They also include details such as a person\u2019s name, role, credential type, and the last time they used their credentials.\n\nNielsen says, \u201cWe have over 75,000 unique sites where people are using Brivo in the U.S. and in 40+ countries around the world. We have over 20 million folks with credentials and generate about 13 million to 14 million events a day. You won\u2019t find that magnitude of data elsewhere. In terms of user experience, it\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve found.\u201d\n\nWith all that data, Brivo places great value on the information it holds, knowing the data would be useless without the ability to analyze trends and gain insights.\nVisualization and Reporting with a Seamless Interface\nBrivo will roll out the fourth generation of its cloud-based access control platform later in 2020. The platform, which is built for enterprisescale companies, hosts a modern user interface via a single-page application that aims to use the underlying security data. This platform provides several tools, such as the following examples, for large-scale organizations to easily visualize, analyze, and understand their security data.\n\nGlobal View entails a map of sites anywhere across the globe. Users can view unusual activity that\u2019s highlighted by a flashing red pin at the location.\nPhotos pop-up on a screen to show individuals as they enter and exit a door.\nUsers can call a snapshot log to view the profile pictures of everyone who just entered or exited a particular door.\nWith more fine-grained permissions, larger organizations can flexibly define permissions by role, with fewer permissions to a security guard, for example, and more permissions to executive levels.\nThe availability of bulk actions means users can assign thousands of credentials at one time instead of assigning them one-by-one.\nThe real-time device view shows all doors, panels (gateways), readers, and cameras that an enterprise has at one time that users can sort, filter, and search.\nEvery page has sort, filter, and search capabilities to work better at scale.\n\nKerstin Demko, Brivo\u2019s Vice President of Marketing, states, \u201cAdding these features and more comprehensive options for security delivers on our promise to the market to provide a safer, smarter, simply better future. We\u2019re helping our customers gain visibility into their security, giving them the control they need to make sure that the right people get the right\naccess and can take action when appropriate.\u201d\nWith the new embedded analytics platform, Brivo\u2019s enterprise customers can now zoom in on their data, find what they need, and act quickly. From the minute someone reaches a door, Brivo gathers data that users can focus on and analyze by site, date, or week depending on their needs.\n\n\u201cWith the amount of knowledge and industry that we\u2019ve married with this kind of data visualization from insightsoftware, Brivo is literally changing the game for access control.\u201d\n\u2013 Kerstin Demko, Vice President of Marketing, Brivo\n\nBrivo and insightsoftware: Delivering a More Secure Future\nBy partnering with insightsoftware, Brivo can provide greater value in their customer solutions and increase the number of enterprise users and average revenue per account. Plus, Brivo saved on developer time, resources, and money by embedding analytics from Logi Symphony instead of trying to build the capabilities in-house.\nBrivo has reached a whole new level in providing secure building access. Through their partnership with insightsoftware, Brivo embedded analytics capabilities directly into their security platform, increasing their time to market. Now that their customers have access to the immense value in their data, they can analyze the information they need, gain insights, generate in-depth reports, and act quickly.

        "content": "\nIn Brief\n\nJUB Group\u2019s planning processes were manual, mostly in Excel and their own application, and time-consuming, taking more time to complete.\nJUB turned to insightsoftware partner Result to find a better planning solution to streamline planning cadences and increase agility.\nResult evaluated JUB\u2019s goals and provided a Bizview implementation that offered greater planning flexibility and collaboration.\nSince implementation, JUB has shortened the planning process, implemented twice yearly forecasts, and enjoys more effective team collaboration.\nBizview has facilitated the easy integration of newly acquired business units into JUB\u2019s ERP and existing budgeting and planning processes.\n\nJUB Group\u202fis a successful international corporation, based in Slovenia, with an almost 150-year history in the production of paints. Its mission is to create innovative, energy-saving, environmentally friendly, and user-friendly products and technologies for the protection, refurbishment, and maintenance of buildings. JUB Group is comprised of 14 subsidiaries and operates in more than 30 markets worldwide. In 2022 JUB joined NIPPON Group, one of the largest manufacturers of paints in the world.\nThe Challenge\nRapidly changing business conditions, the growth of the group, and the increasing number of stakeholders involved in the planning and reporting process presented significant challenges for JUB Group. It had a 20-year-old business intelligence (BI) solution and an in-house planning tool that was only used for sales; JUB used a vast number of Excel spreadsheets to plan all other processes.\nManual planning processes were long and complicated \u2013 more than 170 employees were involved in the business planning and reporting process. They had to create a unified plan across 14 units in a 39-market region, in more than ten business areas including sales, procurement, production, investments, HR, logistics, IT, TQC, maintenance, and marketing. This led to a high rate of errors due to manual transfers of planning data between Excel, the sales app, and SAP.\nJUB had no insight into the \u201creal-time\u201d planning process, as it was impossible to keep track of all the corrections and small changes necessary to combine values into an integrated financial plan. Managing large quantities of planning data and distilling it into a single, integrated plan was a struggle.\nWith more than 30 markets worldwide, the biggest challenge was planning sales at the item level, categorizing the product groups and item codes, merging the data into the purchase and production plan and then, finally, into the financial plan.\nIt took a full month to complete the sales planning process and another month to complete the financial planning process. Because manual planning processes took so much time, JUB was confined to a single annual planning cycle, limiting its agility and responsiveness to market shifts.\nJUB turned to insightsoftware partner Result to find a better planning solution that could streamline planning processes and increase its agility. Result is a leading authority in technology enablement with more than 30 years of experience solving problems for its clients.\nThe Solution\nTo meet JUB\u2019s planning challenges, Result first needed to learn what features JUB was looking for in a new solution. The ideal solution would be a modern, web-based solution that provided flexibility on data at all levels: organizational structure, item grouping, financial statements, etc. Next, JUB needed better workflows and collaboration, including flexible data integration and the ability to add custom spread and computation functions at the cell level in input forms.\nBased on JUB\u2019s needs, Result delivered a comprehensive Bizview planning system, as well as a data warehouse to make it easy to combine operational data from SAP with planning data from Bizview. In addition, JUB\u2019s 20-year-old BI system was replaced with the modern Qlik Sense analytics platform.\nBizview is an integrated, web-based budgeting, planning and forecasting solution with an Excel-like interface. It allows businesses to shorten planning cycles, collaborate effectively across teams, and increase planning accuracy. Bizview\u2019s flexibility made it an ideal solution for JUB\u2019s needs.\nResult customized JUB\u2019s Bizview implementation by developing advanced features based on its specific needs, such as:\n\nCell-based computation function\nEnhanced data manipulation functions\n\u2018Spread\u2019 feature for sales planning based on historical data\nAdvanced workflow and collaboration features\n\nBizviews standard features, combined with these custom advanced features, greatly simplified and accelerated JUB\u2019s planning processes.\nFaster Processes and Better Forecasts\nImplementation of Bizview meant the digital transformation of budgeting and reporting at JUB.\nPrior to Bizview implementation, JUB completed only one planning cycle each year; now, it is able to complete more planning and forecasting cycles. Planning the business year in one application \u2013 instead of in the sales planning application, Excel, and SAP \u2013 allows JUB to make twice yearly \u201cbottom-up\u201d forecasts in all areas and have the results automatically rolled up into the overall financial plan.\nThe new solution has shortened the planning cycle dramatically and made it more collaborative. With Bizview\u2019s advanced workflows, JUB has better control over the process and greater confidence in the security and accuracy of the data, which are now centralized. Users from finance to leadership are automatically informed via email about upcoming deadlines, delays, or necessary action items, leading to a simplified planning process with less work, more accurate data, and fewer problems.\nWhat was once a labor-intensive, highly complex planning process that took more than two months to complete can now be done in just one month, allowing for more frequent forecasting and greater business agility.\nAgility and Growth Enablement\nWith its ability to adapt and scale, Bizview is enabling JUB Group to accelerate its business growth with collaborative and connected planning and forecasting. As JUB expands its business through new acquisitions, Bizview makes it easy to integrate the new business units into its planning and budgeting processes. JUB needs only to enter the new acquisition to SAP and Bizview automatically incorporates its data into JUB\u2019s existing budgeting and planning templates and workflows, saving the company untold hours and resources.\nAs JUB Group grows and thrives, the company continues to work with Result for product support and upgrades, appreciating Result\u2019s knowledge, experience, timeliness, and reliable quality.\nTo see how Bizview can help your organization consolidate your planning and reporting, develop accurate and integrated plans, shrink planning cycles, and improve team productivity, schedule a demo today.\n"

        "title": "AVR Realty Case Study Case Study - Reporting & Analytics - insightsoftware",
        "company": "AVR Realty Co.",
        "content": "\nIn Brief\n\nAVR Realty spent 20 days per month on reporting with manual processes.\nAfter implementing Spreadsheet Server, monthly reporting for the organization\u2019s in-house portfolio was reduced by 10 days.\nThe tool has helped AVR Realty\u2019s accountants achieve greater self service without the need for advanced knowledge of MRI.\n\nAVR Realty Company is a leading private real estate development, investment, and management firm. Headquartered in New York, the company spans 20 states and over 70 cities. AVR Realty\u2019s properties include hotels, multifamily apartments, retail centers, office buildings, and ground-up development. Over the firm\u2019s 70-year history, AVR has built its reputation for vision, innovation, and quality.\nChallenged by Inefficient Processes\nAs a business that operates in multiple jurisdictions and asset classes, AVR Realty contends with a variety of moving parts. Prior to 2019, the business ran its reporting through MRI, which was a tricky process that required detailed knowledge of the ERP.\nJennifer Carman, Director of Operations, oversaw the reporting process. Having been an MRI user for 16 years, 8 of which at AVR Realty she had gained an expertise in MRI. However, she was the only person on staff with a detailed knowledge of the ERP system, which required her to work closely with accounting to create reports. With this lack of self service, monthly reporting was a time-consuming process.\n\u201cWe had come a long way in cleaning up reports and creating financial statements, but it was very basic,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cMRI has their reports in what\u2019s called financial formats, where you need to create the structure to go with the report. It\u2019s very cumbersome. If you don\u2019t have prior experience with it, it can be really difficult.\u201d\nOn top of complicated MRI reporting, AVR Realty couldn\u2019t use the ERP to create custom reports. Instead, ad hoc reporting required manipulation in Excel. This was particularly important since AVR Realty\u2019s cross-asset platform aggregates both in-house and externally managed data from third party management companies, necessitating the need for customization.\nAs a result, reporting was so time consuming that the team wasn\u2019t finished with the process until the 20th of each month. Jennifer and the accounting management team knew MRI alone wasn\u2019t enough to meet AVR Realty\u2019s needs. This is why they set out to find the right tool to give accounting the power to report more independently while streamlining time-consuming processes.\nFinding Help in the Nick of Time\nWhen Jennifer and the accounting management team set out to find a reporting solution, the key criteria were flexibility, ease-of-use, and an Excel-based interface. While at an MRI conference, they discovered Spreadsheet Server. Spreadsheet Server offered AVR Realty:\n\nGreater self-service\nSignificant time savings\nSeamless integration with MRI\n\nThe discovery came at just the right time\u2013the firm began implementing the solution at the tail end of 2019, just before the pandemic hit. \u201cIt was perfect timing when we implemented it and had our training,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cWe were able to create a lot of reports that helped management with monitoring and making decisions during a crucial time. They were concerned with the rent collections every day, so we were able to create a report that showed what was collected by property and by tenant.\u201d\nImplementation\nAVR Realty worked closely with its insightsoftware account manager for a smooth implementation. \u201cFor me, implementation was easy because I already had a background with MRI,\u201d Jennifer explained. Afterward, AVR Realty hosted staff training so that accountants could quickly get comfortable with the solution.\nThe company also uses Spreadsheet Server\u2019s Query Designer, which allows users to build their own custom queries. \u201cThe training was great; it was very thorough,\u201d said Jennifer. \u201cThen, we got hooked up with our account manager, and we connect whenever we can. We\u2019re constantly thinking of new reports we want to create.\u201d\n\u201cOur Accounting Manager, who didn\u2019t have as much experience in MRI, was able to get quickly up and running,\u201d Jennifer continued. \u201cAfter training, she was able to easily adapt to Spreadsheet Server and Query Designer.\u201d\nResults \nDuring a time when digitizing business was crucial, AVR Realty used Spreadsheet Server to save time, create mission-critical reports, and achieve better visibility on its properties. Spreadsheet Server allowed the business to:\n\nSlash reporting times in half\nEliminate the need for backup reports\nGive accountants the ability to report without assistance or IT intervention\n\nA Drastic Reduction in Reporting Times \nPrior to implementing Spreadsheet Server, AVR Realty spent most of the month finalizing month-end close. But once the business got up and running with Spreadsheet Server, the tool cut AVR Realty\u2019s reporting times clean in half.\n\u201cWe were lucky to finish reporting by the 20th of each month,\u201d Jennifer explained. \u201cBack then, we didn\u2019t have a complete-looking package. A month ago, we finalized our monthly package for retail. With that and the additions to our work papers for our financials monthly, they\u2019re able to get their financials done by the 10th and then they\u2019re able to report within the next day or two.\u201d\nIndividual reports also take less time to complete, saving the accounting staff significant amounts of time. \u201cUsing Spreadsheet Server, it takes me 30 seconds to update a file whereas it used to take me 5 minutes,\u201d Jennifer added. \u201cIf I\u2019m able to reduce even one process from taking 2 minutes to 1 minute, it\u2019ll add up.\u201d\nAdditionally, AVR Realty has started to roll out Spreadsheet Server to other departments, to assist them in real-time decision making.\nSelf-Service and Flexibility\nJennifer was the only person on staff with significant expertise on MRI, so she was thoroughly involved in checking the reports the accounting team generated. Additionally, she\u2019s responsible for the operations and lease administration for the AVR Realty retail portfolio. Now, with Spreadsheet Server\u2019s self-service reporting, accountants at AVR Realty can generate more accurate reports on their own.\n\u201cMy background is heavily involved in operations and lease administration. When reviewing the CAM/Tax recoveries, I used to have to open up the accountants\u2019 work papers, then open up additional MRI reports to compare,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cWe\u2019re human. You can easily type in the wrong number. Your eyes can mess with you and you can put in the wrong line. Spreadsheet Server has made the process so much quicker for our accountants, and it\u2019s made the review process easier for me because I don\u2019t have to double check their numbers. Now, I only have to make sure they\u2019re accruing it correctly, deferring it correctly, and the percentages are correct. It\u2019s helped on both sides.\u201d\n\u201cBeing able to pull from MRI and update the data quickly is huge from an administrative perspective,\u201d Jennifer continued. \u201cIt aids in the day-to-day functions of most people.\u201d\nMaking Sense of a Chaotic Time \nAVR Realty implemented Spreadsheet Server in late 2019 and trained teams on how to use the solution in January of 2020. That year would turn out to be tumultuous, one that demanded companies to scramble to adopt rapid digitization. But because the company had already adopted a solution that helped them report more quickly, smoothly, and independently, AVR Realty was prepared.\n\u201cWe had a great implementation person who walked us through everything,\u201d Jennifer said. Implementation happened just before COVID hit, then the process continued smoothly. This was critical for the business while it navigated the drastic changes the pandemic presented.\nLooking Forward to the Future\nSpreadsheet Server has allowed AVR Realty to save a significant amount of time on reporting, freeing up days every month to look ahead. In the future, Jennifer is looking for new ways to leverage Spreadsheet Server and Query Designer.\nHer next project is adding new pages and new fields so that they have more details in MRI to pull and create reports from by using Spreadsheet Server. Tax season is still stressful\u2013the business does tax returns annually that incorporate multiple entities. Currently, the organization does its taxes manually, but Jennifer is looking to take the time she\u2019s saved on reporting to streamline this process for an easier, cleaner, and more accurate tax process.\nWith the time the firm has freed up with Spreadsheet Server, AVR Realty has become more proactive. When it used to be bogged down by manual processes that required thorough double checking and heavy supervision, the accounting team now has a tool at their disposal to report more quickly, accurately, and independently.\n"

        "content": "\nAbout BlueVolt\nFounded in 2003 and headquartered in Portland, OR, BlueVolt is a pioneer in the elearning industry. BlueVolt\u2019s solutions help a wide range of organizations increase sales, build brand awareness, and enhance employee productivity. Along with its learning management system, the company offers a range of client-focused services, including course and curriculum development, strategic support and channel-training innovations that make learning a strategic asset. To learn more, visit bluevolt.com.\nHighlights\n\nDelivered their analytics solution 85 percent faster than building their own\nEnabled customers to increase sales up to 16 percent in 4\u20136 months\nAllows customers to combine their own data with BlueVolt\u2019s platform data\nEmpowers BlueVolt customers to analyze their data and plan for the future\nDifferentiated BlueVolt from its competitors\n\nStreamline reporting and discover insights right in the platform\nMany companies like BlueVolt are promoting the idea that training is the new marketing. But not all training and marketing strategies are created equal. BlueVolt goes beyond basic learning management systems (LMS) to provide training and networking through the application of strategic channel learning and readiness (CLR) practices. Part of that strategy involves giving customers what they need in the platform to gauge course usage, monitor which courses are performing well, and verify connections between courses and product sales throughout customer channels.\nTo stay competitive in the CLR space, BlueVolt wanted to provide greater value to their customers. They focused on addressing three challenges with their existing platform:\nLimited reporting. Their customers\u2014 especially the small to medium businesses (SMBs)\u2014were limited to using spreadsheets for their reporting. They had many questions about their data that they couldn\u2019t answer with their reports.\nLack of insights. Because customers were limited by the platform\u2019s reporting capabilities, their customers lacked the in-depth insights they needed to make more informed decisions about their businesses.\nInsu\u001fcient development resources. BlueVolt didn\u2019t want to pull their development team away from their core business. And it didn\u2019t make sense to hire a team to develop analytics capabilities in-house.\nGaven Singh, Vice President of BlueVolt, said:\n\nOur platform was primarily for reporting. It wasn\u2019t designed for digging into the data. Instead, our SMB customers were left exporting information into Excel and figuring it out from there. As a business, our focus was on our two top priorities: The Sharing Center, which provides seamless access for sharing product training courses to our customer network; and our CLR software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform. To better serve our customers, we needed the right solution, but we needed something we didn\u2019t have to build ourselves.\n\nGain a deeper understanding of products, business, and channels\nBlueVolt was determined to enhance their platform from basic reporting functions to providing analytics for greater visualization and insights. Singh explained,\n\nWe wanted to help our customers understand their business better and improve how they report to upper management and corporate leadership. We wanted to give them information about the status of their business, programs, and channels to guide their business decisions.\n\nBecause reporting and analytics weren\u2019t part of BlueVolt\u2019s core business, they needed a vendor with a capable analytics solution that could fulfill their requirements. The solution had to provide deep insights that would enable their customers to answer their questions about their products, business, and channels.\nIn choosing a vendor, BlueVolt needed one that offered a flexible, customizable solution. As BlueVolt searched for the right partner, they looked at several possible solutions. When they looked more closely at each one, they found that most of them were focused on reporting only, not adding the analytics capabilities they needed. Then they discovered Logi Symphony.\nGet flexible and scalable reporting and analytics in a single platform\nBlueVolt partnered with Logi Symphony to provide their customers a better experience.\n\nLogi Symphony offers more of the analytics capabilities that we were looking for, rather than just reporting. Their platform gives us the flexibility and scalability that we needed that the other platforms didn\u2019t offer.\n\nBlueVolt chose the Logi Symphony solution for the following reasons:\n\nSelf-service. BlueVolt\u2019s customers can tailor and configure Logi Composer to match the skill level of their end users, while enabling them to modify and share their own visualizations.\nAutomated scheduling. Their customers\u2019 administrators or end users can schedule reports to automatically run on daily, weekly, monthly, or custom event schedules.\nPowerful analytics. Their customers can connect to data at a deeper level for greater visualization. They can gain critical insights into the current state of their business, define trends, and guide future growth opportunities.\nTime to market. BlueVolt can focus on their core business and deliver their analytics solution 85 percent faster than building their own platform. Plus, it works within their existing security infrastructure, allowing them to manage their data security and data privacy.\n\n\nWith Logi Symphony, we want to move away from simply reporting and instead move toward analytics and insights that show organizations how their business is performing, whether it\u2019s growing, shrinking, or staying the same. Instead of sending Excel spreadsheets, they can now show the data that demonstrates how their business is actually doing.\n\nDemonstrated customer use cases\nTo generate feedback about their embedded analytics usage over the first 4\u20136 months, BlueVolt conducted a customer survey. The results showed that, since embedding the Logi Symphony solution, BlueVolt customers have quickly taken to creating their own use cases.\nReading trends in the network.\nAcross the board, BlueVolt customers have noticed the ability to identify and leverage data trends in the network. In particular, BlueVolt University administrators can see which courses are shared, who enrolls in them, and the number of course enrollments and completions. Because of BlueVolt\u2019s ability to integrate this data with customer sales data, University administrators can show correlations in real time between product training course completions and sales growth.\nThis type of network data offers University administrators complete visibility of their product training investment. They know how much they are putting into training across the BlueVolt network and how much they\u2019re getting in return by their sales numbers.\nMerging data to show growth.\nBlueVolt\u2019s distributor and manufacturer customers can now merge data to identify trends in the BlueVolt network so they can pivot and change their e\u001forts faster than ever before.\nTheir distributor customers can identify new opportunities by merging their BlueVolt course data with their sales data. For example, they know the courses each sales representative has completed. With the new embedded analytics dashboard, their distributor leaders can compare the course completion data with the sales representative\u2019s sales records. If sales reps are not performing well, leaders can redirect them to the appropriate training to boost their numbers.\nThe distributors reported a 3\u20136 percent sales growth rate. They attribute this increase to their new ability to identify sales enablement opportunities.\nBlueVolt\u2019s manufacturer customers have also reviewed their embedded analytics course data against their sales data. Their numbers show which distributor partners sell more effectively.\n\nWith Logi Symphony, we want to move away from simply reporting and instead move toward analytics and insights that show organizations how their business is performing, whether it\u2019s growing, shrinking, or staying the same. Instead of sending Excel spreadsheets, they can now show the data that demonstrates how their business is actually doing.\n\nIn the BlueVolt survey, these customers identified a 7\u201316 percent sales increase among their distributors who completed more product training courses than the ones who completed fewer courses. This data revealed additional opportunities for manufacturers to promote their courses or require distributors to train in the BlueVolt network as part of their manufacturer contracts.\nFinding new revenue opportunities.\nCustomers are also using BlueVolt\u2019s data to gain better insights into their e-commerce revenue generation opportunities. With the new embedded BlueVolt analytics capabilities, powered by Logi Symphony, University administrators can identify their high-performing and low-performing courses.\nBy visualizing the performance rate of each product training course, administrators can update courses, prepare better plans for new ones, and eliminate low-performing ones. As customers began using their data to make decisions about their courses, they reported an average increase in e-commerce sales of about 7 percent. They owe this increase to simply changing or updating low-performing courses, as indicated by data trends in the network.\nCreate better courses and marketing strategies through data and insights\nThe biggest differentiator for BlueVolt is that their customers can use and merge their own data, such as their sales data, with BlueVolt\u2019s learning data. By adding an analytics layer in their application, BlueVolt\u2019s customers can make direct correlations between learning and product training with sales throughout their channels. They can also identify\nincreases and decreases in these areas.\n\u201cThe ability to bring your own data and mix it with our platform data really sets us apart from our competition,\u201d said Singh. \u201cNo longer do our customers have to move their data to a third-party application for reporting; they can analyze their data and generate reports right in our application.\u201d\n\u201cNow that we\u2019ve denormalized and flattened our data, our customers have access to, and full transparency of, that data right within the system,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt looks pretty slick. It\u2019s a modern application and gives our customers the ability to better understand their business. In addition to reporting, they see insights into where their business is and the potential for future growth. They can crunch their data as they see fit and extract it for their executive presentations.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThis feature enables our customers to gain transparency of their data and manage it, providing instant ROI. We\u2019re offering this feature on three levels: the core level that comes with the platform, the executive level, and the developer level. Each level is designed to meet the unique data needs of our customers.\u201d\n"

Centida\u2019s expertise with innovative tools also supports long-term sustainable changes across multiple industries, including IT and communications, manufacturing, transportation, logistics, food and beverage, pharma and professional services.\n3 Main Value / Improvement Points:\n\nREVENUE GROWTH: 50 \u2013 80% growth with Power ON\nSERVICES REVENUE: 50% increase in consulting/other partnership revenue\nENHANCED VALUE: Customers capitalize on Power BI investment for planning\n\nChallenges: \n\nPower BI has no out-of-the-box planning capability\nSpreadsheet planning is unwieldy, error-prone, time-consuming\nIncrease revenue with existing & new customers\nExpand with additional solutions and services\n\nAfter launching Centida in 2014, co-founders Christian Barte (CEO and Managing Director) and Ilya Fedorkov (CTO, BI and Data Analytics Expert) applied their deep financial and analytics expertise to reporting, budgeting and planning.\nThey had always relied on Power BI\u2019s powerful business intelligence and data visualization to meet clients\u2019 reporting and analytics needs. But when large clients also required large-scale planning capabilities, Power BI couldn\u2019t meet those comprehensive requirements. Centida launched a search for a planning tool that could work within Power BI and function much like spreadsheets, the go-to tool for so many planning and analysis teams everywhere.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t use Power BI to plan and planning is a mess with spreadsheets,\u201d says Christian. \u201cFP&A teams are lost and looking for help 2 to 3 months into their planning cycles, because plans based on spreadsheets aren\u2019t easy to manage.\u201d\nCentida knew that to help its customers and build consultancy, it needed a tool that would integrate and function within Power BI. Ideally, the new planning software would also look and feel like Power BI and the most commonly used spreadsheets because that familiarity tends to accelerate user acceptance and flatten the learning curve.\nCentida knows FP&A teams plan in spreadsheets. But those spreadsheets weren\u2019t designed for large-scale planning or to accommodate data files over 500 MB/1,000,000 rows. On top of that, spreadsheets typically lack critical collaboration and workflow features, version control, management and consolidation capabilities.\nAs a result, FP&A teams often devote up to 90% of their time to playing around with spreadsheets, managing version control or data collection. And when FP&A teams use spreadsheets to plan, they don\u2019t have the time or information required to ask management insightful, fact-based questions about the business.\nAs the team at Centida looked for options, they briefly considered building their own solution, but quickly decided they\u2019d focus on what they knew best \u2013 their niche as a professional services provider.\n\u201cWe know what it takes to build a software app, and it requires significant resources,\u201d says Christian.\nBack in 2018, when Centida sourced Power ON, it was the only software built to provide write-back and operate within Power BI.\n\u201cPower ON was, and still is, a unique solution \u2013 there\u2019s nothing quite like it in the marketplace,\u201d says Christian. \u201cSince 2018, we\u2019ve worked with Power ON and Power BI to make the most of this partnership as we evolve and grow together.\u201d\nSolution: Power ON Partnership\nWith Power ON and Power BI, the team at Centida has an incredibly functional, user-friendly planning and write-back solution that makes sense to financial controllers and analysts.\n\u201cPower ON was revolutionary \u2013 it was the only option and we\u2019d never seen anything like it, but at the same time, it was familiar because it was created and designed for Power BI and the Excel/Microsoft environment,\u201d says Christian.\nBecause Power On feels so familiar, the FPA teams, from the planners to the analysts and senior executives, get comfortable with Power ON in a couple of hours. In conjunction with the functionality, that ease-of-use further boosts acceptance.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a bit harsh, but as we see it, it\u2019s a few hours of training to figure out how Power ON works versus a lifetime with legacy, behemoth solutions like SAP, Oracle and IBM,\u201d says Christian.\nPower ON\u2019s Visual Planner lets users write-back (add, change, delete) and plan in Power BI directly to a centralized database. Everyone has immediate, easy access to the current, accurate data they need to create reports and model and modify plans and forecasts. They can also add comments or justifications for values and run what-if scenarios.\nIn short, they have the data and tools they need to see the operational and business impact before making a final decision. Users also like the fact Power ON\u2019s mathematical functions are identical to those embedded in the most widely used spreadsheets, such as Excel.\nUsers particularly appreciate the sleek dashboards which are easily reformatted and moved around. With just a few clicks, they can instantly see the impact specific actions will have on the organization by running simulations.

        "content": "\nAbout Workwear Group\nWorkwear Group, a world-class leader in specialised uniform solutions, provides workers with a sense of identity and organisations with the opportunity to take pride in their people and honour their brand. From the Australian Navy, to Firefighters, Nurses, and Industrial Teams, Workwear honours their customers by doing the right thing, keeping costs low, and building a brand their customers can trust.\nWorkwear Group\u2019s Data & Analytics team is responsible for supporting analysis, forecast, and decision making for groups across the organisation from sales, merchandise planning, supply chain, and finance. To provide the highest standards of products and customer care, the Data & Analytics team replaced their legacy BI platform and switched to a more modern BI approach with Microsoft Power BI.\nThey extended this approach by adding Power ON to enable more accurate, informative, and timely sales forecasting in Power BI, that was a pivot point for other groups in the organisation to leverage for their reporting and analysis.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nWorkwear Group\u2019s legacy BI platform and database was resource hungry, ad-hoc request heavy, and too manual and bespoke to efficiently support mission critical Sales forecasting and downstream reporting & analysis requirements across the organisation.\nSecurity patches, servers hanging, data restores and refreshes, data availability issues, and lost data often caused delayed or inaccurate forecasts. This had ripple effects across the organisation delaying information for Sales, merchandise planning, supply chain and finance, which ultimately affected customer orders and the decisions of the executive team.\nThe legacy BI ecosystem required the Data & Analytics team to aggregate Sales data in order to provide fast analysis capability. With key sales information suppressed, Sales Account Managers could not drill to underlying details answer questions regarding order quantities, order details, etc., in order to provide an accurate forecast.\nDifferent versions of data model cubes with different rules created \u2018multiple sources-of-truth\u2019 problems, were a challenging to maintain, and created confusion and disagreement with sales teams over which cube to base their forecasts on.\nThe Data & Analytics Team knew there had to be a better way \u2013 and that was to build a new foundation and move to a modern BI platform with Microsoft Power BI.\n\nWhile Power BI provided an easy-to-use self-service capability for reporting needs,\nit created a gap for a sales forecasting and data collection solution.\n\nTo capitalise on the enhanced value of data models in Microsoft Power BI, they needed a data collection mechanism that would allow users to play with forecasting models and write-back to the source data all in one place; as it was important that users can trace data back to the original data source of the report data.\nTheir research for how to enable Write-back in Power BI led them to Power ON.\nBEFORE\n\nLegacy BI platform, manual + bespoke\nDays wasted on de-bugging issues\nLost data with restores + refreshes\nData aggregation + lost transaction detail\nDelayed forecasts impact downstream processes\nReliance on IT for ad-hoc requests\nImpacts on customer orders\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nWith Microsoft Power BI providing a stable and modern BI platform and a source of org-wide reporting and analysis truth, adding Power ON Visual Planner enables Workwear to fill the data-collection and forecasting gap. Now they unify Sales forecasting and downstream org-wide analysis in Power BI.\nVisual Planner extended the efficacy of Power BI with collaborative Sales forecasting and robust data collection allowing Sales to enter forecast data directly in Power BI and write-back to the Azure SQL server database.\nAccount managers are able to enter forecast data directly into Power BI and even add commentary at individual data points to provide management real-time insight to rationale for their forecasts. Management now has a greater understanding of the numbers and can approve forecasts quicker, eliminating days waiting for explanations back and forth via email and delays on future customer orders.\nAs a Microsoft shop, Workwear Group found that Power ON ticked a lot of boxes for their Sales forecasting needs. Workwear Group already invested in Power BI, so Power ON, with real-time writeback to their Azure SQL server database, gave them the ability to integrate their analysis, reporting, and forecasting needs in a single place, supporting enhanced and actionable decision making across the organisation.\n\nSales Account Managers make changes regularly in Power BI with Power ON as they get feedback from their customers and ensure prompt delivery of uniforms to the workers that need them.\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nWorkwear Group\u2019s Data & Analytics team now spends less time on rudimentary data wrangling, server refreshes, and troubleshooting, offering more value to the business with self-service analysis, and real-time collaborative sales forecasts ready for leadership insights.\nWhat used to take 3-4 days for data restore, or even retrieval and debugging data from server-hanging issues, is now done in a matter-of-hours since forecast data is integrated with the Power BI platform.\nSales teams save up-to-a-week or more per month with real-time and automatic updates to the database, eliminating the need to re-key forecast data that was historically frequently lost during restore or refresh procedures.\nAccount managers across Workwear Group, including front-line, regional, and national sales managers, can key in daily forecast numbers now, directly into Power BI, including dynamic commentary, as they receive updates from their customers and the market for the incoming sales. As a result, Sales teams now complete their forecasts faster, giving other departments speedier insight to help process orders and meet their customers\u2019 needs by ensuring orders are in place and on time.\nThe ease of use with Power ON allows Salespeople to enter uplifts from the regular trends in additional units, and captures feedback and changes regularly, which has resulted in better target achievement.\nThe new platform of Power BI and Power ON provide decision makers across the organization visibility they\u2019ve never had in the past; because the data no longer needs to be aggregated to support fast query and analysis requirements. Now, in Power ON + Power BI driven reports and dashboards, users can drill from the top of a customer division or a product category right through to the transaction detail.\nSenior Leadership consumes the information, fuelled in part by Sales Forecasts input via Power ON\u2019s write-back capability, in company-wide Power BI dashboards to monitor KPI\u2019s and drive more informed cross-org and strategic decision making.\nThere\u2019s now one Sales forecast dataset that drives the entire organisation\u2019s Sales reporting and forecasting, eliminating prior confusion on which data cube is correct \u2013 yep, one version of the truth. Finance and other stakeholders across the business use the data driven from Power BI + Power ON for their reporting and analysis \u2013 saying that they are now able to trust the numbers.\nUltimately, timelier and more accurate forecasts provide better direction for the company and enable Workwear Group to stay true to their mission, take pride in their products, honour their brand, and better serve their customers who proudly wear their Workwear Group uniform as they serve in their communities and on the front-lines.\nAFTER\n\nModern, BI platform\nUnified BI + Planning with enhanced datasets\nStreamlined data validation in mere hours vs days\nCan drill into source detail for insight\nCollaborative Sales forecasting in Power BI\nTimely forecasts + approvals\nBetter able to serve customers\n\n"

        "content": "\nAbout BuyIn\nBuyIn is the world\u2019s biggest procurement alliance in the telecommunications industry, with sourcing activities on 5 continents. They provide procurement services for 45 operators, including Deutsche Telekom and Orange, who serve over 498M end users. Its mission is to deliver strategic procurement services, leveraging global scale and innovation. With a combined annual spend in scope of more than \u20ac20 Billion, BuyIn delivers best-in-class procurement results by continuously analyzing millions of data and price points. The companies\u2019 success largely builds on procurement experts and a fast and accurate measurement, sound analyses, and sharing of huge amounts of information.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nIt\u2019s quite a task to drive \u20ac20B in procurement accurately and efficiently across millions of price and data points within 5 continents. It becomes demanding to do it with rapidly changing business needs, multiplied by the pandemic. But that is exactly the challenge faced by BuyIn Analysts and Controllers every month.\nControllers needed to manage data quality and simultaneously meet tight deadlines for month-end project reporting. The company migrated from Excel to Power BI years ago to streamline and speed up shared analysis and reporting. Since Controllers\u2019 monthly updates still required input, and as Power BI is a one-way \u201cconsume\u201d interface, Excel was back in service as a data collection and entry tool. Supporting Analysts have noted that they still had to collect Excel files, many with errant inserted rows or columns. They manually had to upload the data to Power BI\u2019s core SQL tables, before the consolidated results could be viewed in Power BI within BuyIn and Procurement Alliance members.\nThis process of investigating and updating procurement performance & budget items, as well as the manual SQL data uploads & updates, continued to take a large amount of Controller\u2019s and Analyst\u2019s focus. As a consequence, they had less time for more value driven business topics that they were striving for.\nBEFORE\n\n20+ spreadsheets shuttled back and forth\n5+ days: Monthly Procurement performance reporting close\n12+ hours: Devoted to monthly procurement reporting\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nA team of BuyIn business analysts sought a way to leverage their existing Business Intelligence platform, Power BI. If they could keep analyses as well as entry within Power BI, they might avoid the manual issues of data collection, validation, and reporting via spreadsheet templates. All of them required to attain an accurate account of each procurement project across 30 countries, 45 operators, 100s of product groups \u2013 a recurring task month by month.\nIn the past, the process was requiring the management of several intermediate steps and time-consuming iterations with the stakeholders before getting to the end-result.\nBuyIn streamlined the distribution and collection of the latest procurement details, across all Controllers, by choosing to add \u201cwrite-back\u201d to Power BI with Visual Planning from Power ON. With this solution, the Controllers enter the latest information directly into Power BI without searching for the latest spreadsheets, demonstrating the simple method of how BuyIn uses Power ON to improve collaboration. Analysts and Controllers see the data update as it writes-back to the transaction system of record in real-time. In mere minutes, the Controllers now complete investigation and data validation work directly inside Power BI using Visual Planner.\nBy adding the Power ON solutions to Power BI, BuyIn optimized their Controllers\u2019 ability to share, collect, audit, and maintain data quality across their entire monthly forecast process.\n\nWrite-back from Power ON allowed us to remove most of the frustrations and delays for our Controllers and project managers in charge of ensuring quality reporting. ~ Diana \u00c1lvaro-Villanueva, Junior Project Manager Finance\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nHow BuyIn uses Power ON Visual Planner is demonstrated through tangible results: controllers reduced their reporting production time from 5+ days to <2 days (in reality it\u2019s a few hours, however it is a business process demand to keep a spare time of two days). Adding write-back to Power BI the Controllers were able to eliminate nearly all the manual, error-prone pain points, which they used to have with standard Excel project analysis and data validation.\nUsing Visual Planner for Power BI, BuyIn Controllers achieved their objective to increase the speed of producing their reporting without sacrificing data quality standards: previously 3 days for spreadsheet alignments back and forth, plus 2 days of data consolidation to nowadays less than 2 days of validation and mere minutes to publish reports to Executives. With Power ON for Power BI, the same people are able to submit, consolidate and share reports and dashboards in less than 2 working days.\nAnother team that benefits from this new write-back capability is BuyIn\u2019s Finance Services (accounting department). They are using Power On to collect real time budget and re-forecast entries from several budget owners. This enables the company to have the collected data immediately to be used.\nWith Power ON, the BuyIn Analyst team extracted more value and data accessibility, turning Power BI into an analyze + write-back, two-way street business application; and in doing so they are able to continue delivering on their mission of adding value for shareholders and customers. Thanks to this solution, Controllers have now time freed up from low value standard tasks and are able to focus on more value added business topics.\nThe results of how BuyIn uses Power ON stand for themselves: significant reduction in time, improved collaboration, and powerful new insights.\nAFTER\n\nNo more never-ending spreadsheet exchanges\n<2 days: Monthly Procurement performance reporting close\n<3 hours devoted to monthly procurement reporting\n2 additional use cases for other Finance teams\n\n"

        "content": "\nAbout Mater\nEstablished in 1906 with a single not-for-profit hospital, today Mater delivers care and compassion for the sick and needy across an extensive and growing network of 12 hospitals and health centres, as well as education programs and a world-class research institute. Continually striving for excellence, Mater\u2019s Clinical Governance team implemented Power ON to streamline monthly reporting to management and the Board and allow for the unique ability to add commentary within Power BI \u2013 turning KPIs from \u201cjust a number\u201d into the story of the patient.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nThe Clinical Governance team works with all areas of the business to ensure the highest standard of patient safety across Mater hospitals. A key element of its work involves monthly report creation for hospital management and the Board.\nReporting involved data collection across 12 hospital sites and nine regional groups, culminating in 100s of KPIs and associated comments that had to be manually updated every month. Mater used Power BI for collaborative analysis, but Power BI\u2019s limitation of not supporting commentary forced many manual steps to achieve a final monthly report.\nThe initial data collection, as in many organizations, relied heavily on Excel spreadsheets. Participants then recorded figures into a central repository. Data was further aggregated and manipulated in Excel, where charts were added. The final report was built in Microsoft Word to allow for the critical KPI commentary to be added.\nThe Importance of Comments in Power BI\nBehind the actual numbers in KPIs, lies each patient\u2019s story. Commentary associated with each KPI provides context to management and the Board to ensure focus and that choices are made for the betterment of patients. Commentary can highlight successful initiatives to be expanded upon or draw focus to areas in need of improvements. Commentary is critical and a valuable tool in helping achieve Mater\u2019s goal of delivering the highest standard of patient safety on a consistent basis. The monthly report creation process was time-consuming and required considerable coordination and oversight. Growing client demand and data volumes was stretching the existing manual process to the limit. Mater knew there had to be a better way and set out to find one.\nBEFORE\n\n10s to 100s of spreadsheets\nManual report creation in Word to support \u201ccomments\u201d\n100s of KPIs manually calculated\n4-week manual data and commentary consolidation across 3 companies, 12 hospitals and 9 geographical locations\nDisparate data source collation into static Word reports, with limited ability for further analysis\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nResearching potential solutions to the \u201ccommentary and write-back limitation\u201d in Power BI, the Clinical Governance Team at Mater found that Power ON Visual Table Editor addressed their many requirements \u2013 and then some.\nWith Power BI + Power ON they built a Power BI dashboard that allowed 12 hospitals and nine reporting groups to each have individual KPIs visuals that supported collaborative input across key stakeholders. Power ON also enabled them to add current and trend commentary that automatically consolidated into a unified database table for use across operational and Board reports; with the previous month\u2019s trend commentary available for comparison and use in the current month\u2019s evaluation for the first time.\nThe initial setup was relatively straightforward, with the bonus of having Prima Consulting, a local expert, to support implementation. With additional filtering capability and column look-up functionality, the potential to expand the number of analysis and reporting processes beyond the KPI commentary was a huge plus. With minimal training, the team was able to utilise the expanded abilities to capture KPI commentary in Power BI and set their new target benchmarks. User acceptance was quick as the operational advantages were clearly evident.\n\nThe Clinical Governance team now has more time to focus on their primary goals, implementing the highest standards of patient safety across the Mater Hospitals. ~ Mary Jane Capp\u200b, Quality and Safety Manager\u200b\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nManual error-prone data collection in spreadsheets, chart creation and subsequent formatting in Word, has been replaced with automated, accurate, collaborative, and real-time data collection unified in Power BI + Power ON.\nKPIs are now calculated automatically, reducing monthly report creation by 75% (from four weeks to just one), while enabling Clinical Governance staff to add meaningful commentary directly into the dashboard for real-time management use. Management and Board stakeholders now access and review KPIs, plus associated commentary, more quickly \u2013 enabling them to make more timely and wholly informed decisions that positively impact patient care. Oversight has also been, freeing regional users\u2019 time to allocate to higher value work with more immediate patient impact.\nFinally, the Clinical Governance staff now have more time to focus on their prime goal, implementing the highest standard of patient safety across Mater hospitals.\nWhat\u2019s next? With the success of PowerOn with writeback in Power BI in the reporting systems of the Clinical Governance team, further opportunities to leverage the writeback capability are currently being explored in other reporting areas, like hospital blood transfusion usage.\nAFTER\n\nUnified monthly report data collection in Power BI (no more shuffling spreadsheets!)\nAutomated and collaborative commentary collection in Power BI\nAutomatic KPI calculation and consolidation in Power BI\n75% reduction in monthly report creation (from 4 week to just 1 week)\nReal-time, interactive Dashboard in Power BI for further \u201cwhat-if\u201d analysis\n\n"

        "content": "\nAbout Arkin\nArkin has been one of the largest mental health institutions in the Netherlands for many years with broad and varied expertise. Based on their social responsibility, their goal is to provide the best care for all clients who need the expertise of Arkin caregivers. Caring for the most vulnerable is where Arkin\u2019s breadth comes into its own what makes them unique!\nArkin\u2019s business model relies on financing from insurance companies and municipal governments. Serving over 30,000 clients a year, with multiple branches and clinics for patients of varying mental health needs, it\u2019s imperative that the information they provide on patient care to the various stakeholders \u2013 is current, accurate and protects patient privacy.\nThe solution that met these criteria was adding Power ON to their Power BI stack.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nGiven the critical requirement to report accurate patient information, Elisio Santo\u2019s BI team needed a streamlined and connected process for the clinics and caregivers to collect, manage and report on the status of patients and the care being delivered. Time is money, and money equals care.\nArkin had already chosen to replace their legacy BI tool (SAP Business Objects) due to disconnected systems and too much reliance on emailing data back and forth. They chose Microsoft Power BI as their new Business Intelligence Platform.\nPower BI provided major advancements with more modern analysis and reporting; however, users still could not input or collaborate on data in Power BI. To collect data from across the 15 clinics, spreadsheets still needed to be used, which introduced a new set of challenges.\n\n9,000+ Excel forms a year were needed to collect and track daily patient information.\n10+ hours a week, per user, to manually validate and process data from spreadsheets into their Health\nManagement System, (HMS) data warehouse.\nCaregivers were constantly at risk of manual keying errors in Excel based forms.\nRisk to patient privacy with spreadsheet security limitations and manual process.\nPersistent concern of penalties and fines from government and insurance agencies.\n\nIn order to secure appropriate funding to serve their clients, branch managers manually scoured spreadsheets daily to validate patient information and declare the level and cost of care they were providing.\nAs with any manual process things could go wrong, including keying errors, calculation or rollup errors due to row or column insertions. Audits could uncover incorrect information sent to insurance companies increasing the potential risk of fines up to \u20ac100,000. Failure to accurately report to government agencies could mean funding reversals of tens of thousands of euros.\nElisio and his team went in of search of a solution that would give the BI team more control over data accuracy, enable caregiver and clinic managers secure and direct interaction with the data in Power BI, and automate processing of information back into the HMS.\nHow could they collect the information required, securely, all with automated data validation checks? Adding Power ON\u2019s Visual Planner to their existing investment in Power BI was the answer.\nBEFORE\n\n9,000 Excel forms to manage\nDisconnected data collection process\n40 hours a month-per user to validate data\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nAdding Power ON\u2019s solution eliminated the painful process of managing and validating 9,000 spreadsheet input files for multiple teams across the organization. Managers, Caregivers, Finance, the BI team, and Leadership could all use a unified platform (Power BI) to collect data, analyze, determine, manage, and fund patient care.\nWith Power ON, the BI team developed a single Power BI report/form that could be used by multiple departments and clinics daily, to review, enter, and consolidate data on the details and cost of patients and their care.\nThe Power BI report/form rolls up to a Power BI dashboard where management and decision makers can quickly see essential information in real-time; who was admitted, if the patient was in-house or not, how long they were in-house, the reason the patient left or was released, how much funding is being received, surplus, shortfalls?\nData accuracy was improved as data input on the form is automatically validated against HMS data simplifying the process to provide accurate billing and reporting to insurance companies and avoid the risk of costly fines.\nArkin\u2019s Planning and Control group is able to perform in-house audits with ease working off a single dashboard report, versus multiple spreadsheet files. If numbers are green, they know the information from the clinics was processed correctly. If there\u2019s a mismatch, it\u2019s red, and they know exactly where to investigate and correct the discrepancy fast.\nWith Power ON\u2019s integrated and connected solution in Power BI, they can trust the data and drive better outcomes.\nStaff members on the move, working in the community use Power ON\u2019s Mobile app to document progress on projects, saving up to ten hours a project working with a single consistent format for their reporting requirements.\n\nWe spend significantly less time collecting and validating the accuracy of the data by using Power ON with Power BI, giving us more time to devote to patient care.\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nArkin\u2019s switch to Power BI with Power ON brought a modern and quicker approach, with consistent information for managing their details across clinics and patients and reporting accurately to insurance companies and agencies.\nA universal data analysis + collection form in Power BI, and automated validation rules to ensure that clinic data is consistent with the HMS data, produces substantial results:\n\nAvoided: Risk of up to \u20ac100K in fines to insurance companies\nSaved: 10+ hours a week on average, per user, reducing the effort to mere minutes, eliminating manual validation of 9,000 Excel files. That\u2019s 40 hours a month \u2013 for one user.\nImproved: Financial gains and time savings are used for better quality of patient care.\nFunded: Securing higher revenues with timelier and more accurate data.\n\nThe savings with Power ON are staggering of up to 12,000 hours annually to manage 30,000 patients annually, with users across 25 Departments, 15 Branches, 25 Clinics, and minimal effort for the BI team.\nArkin as a whole now spends significantly less time generating and validating the data. They have more trust in the data as well as the outcomes that are reported, saving cycles, time, and money.\nFor Elisio\u2019s BI team, they have more time to listen to end users and understand what they are doing with the information and what else they need to do their work.\nBecause Power ON\u2019s solution is integrated with Power BI, Arkin leverages Microsoft\u2019s Active Directory to provide row level security. With the data now secure, caregivers can access, change, and view information only for patients under their care.\nPower ON + Power BI\u2019s integration with Active Directory reduces the risk of the\nDutch Data Protection Authority fines associated with protection and privacy of patient information.\nFinance can quickly see the status of patients via their Power BI dashboard; how the clinics are standing, how many staff are active or out, and increases or drops in patients. Key information to submit plans to insurance companies and communities that provide funding.\nThe Power BI Dashboards and reports fueled from Power ON collected data enable Finance to better manage the funding ceilings set by insurance companies. They can proactively monitor and reach out to insurance companies if the data indicates they are about to cross the line and if increased funding is in order.\nAs stated earlier; time is money, and money equals care. The time and money Arkin saves is redirected to serving their clients and community better. More funds can be allocated to developing new treatments and bringing people back to healthy living.\nAFTER\n\nSTREAMLINED: One (1) form to manage data collection\nAUTOMATED: Data validation <1 hour\nPROACTIVE: Can better manage funding to deliver consistent, quality patient care\n\n"

It insists on superior engineering and performance in its operations to deliver the highest quality experience to customers.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nA thought leader in their own industry, Lechler sought to bring their high engineering and production standards to internal Sales Forecasting. As with other long-lived enterprises, their legacy planning system was built and expanded in Excel. It depended on data manually tabulated from more than 50 spreadsheets, many of which contained complex formulas and macros that performed inconsistently as rows were inserted or links inadvertently broken. The annual sales forecasting process required more than two dedicated head office FTE just over four weeks to collect, cross-check, and consolidate the data and validation files. Because of the manual Excel-based challenges Sales Forecasting was undertaken only once a year.\nExecutives and Sales Managers needed more timely insight into what happened and anticipate what needed to happen in order to achieve changing targets of the modern global economy and to support the changing needs of their customers.\nBefore\n\n50+ spreadsheets w/ links, v-lookups\u2026\nInnumerable complex macros, formulas\n4 weeks manual data collection, consolidation, cross-check, validation\nSales Planning only 1x / year \u2192 took 3+ months\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nLechler envisioned a solution which could integrate with the organization\u2019s recent investment in and choice for company-wide Business Intelligence: Microsoft\u2019s Power BI. A quick \u201cGoogle\u201d for \u201cplanning and forecasting in Power BI\u201d led them to Power ON BI\u2019s Visual Planner.

Employees and managers immediately accepted the new solution. Staff training took only one hour. The new process allowed front line managers to contribute to the process without compromising security or adding workload and eliminated the manual data preparation and spreadsheet distribution process, clearly demonstrating that how Lechler uses Power ON could have dramatic impacts on sales planning productivity.\n\nPower ON helped our team convert data into value.\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nWith connected planning within Power BI everyone, from the salesperson to division and regional executives, can review and input data which is immediately visible to all stakeholders using just their web browser. They also appreciate the opportunity to both contribute more value to the process, while simultaneously freeing up more time for higher value work.\nWith Visual Planner, the company now sees opportunity to be more accurate in scheduling notices sent to customers. How Lechler uses Power ON includes gradually expanding the usage of Visual Planner for Power BI for other Enterprise Performance disciplines like Cost Controlling, Strategy Planning and Profitability Planning.\nIn a world predominated by uncertainty, being able to deliver advanced insight, and accuracy, is highly valued by all stakeholders: customers, employees, investors, and executives alike.\nAFTER\n\nFEWER: 50+ spreadsheets replaced by real-time data input and write-back in Power BI\nAUTOMATED: Reduced staff hours spent on manual data collection and validation\nCOLLABORATIVE: Involved entire sales org; frontline, regional, country, corporate\nPROACTIVE: Quickly respond to market changes by Sales Planning 3x / yr (vs 1x / yr before)\nEFFICIENT: Adding Capacity + Investment Planning via Power BI; deliver more value to customers\n\n"

        "content": "\nAbout\nCalifornia Olive Ranch pioneered new ways of cultivating and harvesting olives in California to make the highest quality extra virgin olive oil at affordable prices by blending tradition with innovation.\nWith Microsoft Navision as their ERP system of record and Microsoft Power BI in-house, the IT team continues this spirit of innovation to support sales and the business with improved Planning and Forecasting from Power ON BI.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nThe California Olive Ranch relies on accurate and timely data for retail trade plans that drive the bottom line for the business. Incomplete records for trade spending and a disconnected sales forecasting process made it difficult to budget. It was a huge open loop that needed to be closed.\nUsing a 3rd\u202fparty tool, multiple spreadsheets,\u202fand a custom-built application, they were able to capture what happened, but they could not\u202fcapture\u202fwhat the\u202fsales team needed to plan for in retail trade such as sales volumes, promotions, estimated costs,\u202for any commentary.\u202fThis led to\u202fchallenges on the production side of the business and\u202fcarrying more inventory than was needed.\nA small IT team and an antiquated method of planning led to too much overtime and high employee turnover. IT needed to work every weekend with broken and cumbersome processes in place. Poor processes led to a credibility issue for IT within the company and low\u202femployee morale within the group.\nThey had to\u202fcome up\u202fwith a better way to plan their retail trade\u202fmodels, have a new method to\u202fproduce\u202fforecasts and a single place for one source of truth.\nBefore\n\nLack of control in trade forecasting\nHypothetical inputs were driving forecasts\nDisconnected planning and forecast system\nProduction Team struggled translating Sales forecasts to production\nCarried too much inventory\nWay too many desktop spreadsheets\n3-4 days a month to merge budget vs actual reports\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nThe answer was in their existing Business Intelligence platform, Microsoft Power BI. By extending the capabilities of Power BI with Power ON, they developed a new method of forecasting that allowed users to remain in familiar tools like Excel and Power Pivot.\nPower ON improved Retail Trade Planning and Forecasting by bringing collaboration and insight into the process with easy data entry, commentary and write-back to the underlying database.\nThe sales team are now able to enter their forecasts directly into the Power ON? system. Finance now has real-time insight into the sales forecast to a much greater detail rather than broad percentages, such as what items will be on promotion, what discount will be offered for each item, and how long the discount will be offered for, and with the ability to easily modify when needed.\nThe new process with Power ON pushed the responsibility to the people who are actually responsible for making the plan, instead of everything having to filter through one person.\n\nBefore Power ON, I was easily working 60 hours a week. Every weekend, for a full year. Today, I might work just one weekend a month! ~ Director of Information Technology\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nThe functional groups within California Olive Ranch that bring olive oil to our tables: the farm team, the mill, the bottling team, and sales, now all have access to easy data collection, real-time commentary and what-if analysis to produce more accurate budgets and forecasts.\nCalifornia Olive Ranch now has much better visibility into their budget. When they look at the budget versus actuals, people believe it, because there is now only one source of truth, which was a huge hurdle to overcome. Power ON takes a subjective process and makes it objective \u2013 working with real numbers, not guesses or hypothetical data.\nAnalysts save 3-4 days a month with Power ON\u2019s easy to set up automated reports which pull data users have collected and merges with the data from their ERP system. Reliably delivering results through Power BI to the decision makers and executives quicker so they are better informed with real-time insights for critical decision making.\nPower ON elevated the image of IT with Finance, Production, Sales, and Leadership teams across the company, eliminating siloes, creating stronger partnerships, and a more collaborative environment to drive improvements.\nAfter\n\nForecasting from annually to quarterly\nGreater visibility into the budget\nConfidence in numbers with one source of truth\nAble to involve more users in Forecasting process\nDynamic collaboration between Finance and business users\n\n"

        "content": "\nAbout Vienna BioCenter Core Facilities\nVienna BioCenter Core Facilities (VBCF) provides shared research infrastructure and services for over \u20ac30 MM of high-tech equipment to some of the world\u2019s most renowned researchers in the field of life sciences.\nVBCF Finance needed a better way to manage costs, reporting, forecasting and decision support, to efficiently allocate equipment and resources across its 13 facilities (departments). Power ON for Planning and Forecasting was the obvious solution to capitalize on their recent investment in Microsoft Power BI Reporting.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nVBCF used traditional Excel spreadsheets for planning and forecasting as well as reporting. A 25MB+ master Excel workbook became nearly impossible to manage given complex formulas and interdependent worksheets. Slow to open, update, and refresh, it began presenting persistent data quality challenges taking excessive time to maintain. Consequently, the finance department spent an inordinate amount of time on repeating, little value-adding tasks.\nPriding themselves as a cutting-edge organization driven by a culture of innovation, VBCF sought out a cutting-edge solution to the age-old spreadsheet data collection, analysis, and reporting problem. The Finance Team went in search of a modern approach that could allow them to capitalize on their experience and current IT investments.\nTHE SOLUTION\nThe Finance department already ran a preliminary reporting model in Power BI/Power Pivot connected to an Access database and Excel spreadsheets as an interim solution. After the first good experiences with Power BI, they had to solve the important and complex task to incorporate budgeting and forecasting.\nWith Power ON they found the ideal partner for this challenge.\nIn the astonishingly short time of just 10 days, the team of Power ON replaced their siloed Excel spreadsheets and Access database with an integrated solution in Power BI + Power ON Power Planner (using an Azure database). This solution enabled cloud-based collaboration and write-back in Power BI, with entry via Excel.\nThis was a huge win for the Finance Department, speeding up the forecasting process by an order of magnitude. The previous workload to ensure data quality was dramatically reduced, and complex use-cases and accounting demands are now easily integrated for consistent and reliable reporting. The familiar, intuitive, and flexible options to use Excel or Power BI UX, required little training and users could access the data at any time via their device and application of choice.\n\nWith Power ON, Finance keeps the familiarity of Excel, and the business benefits with automated, connected, real-time and collaborative Reports, Forecasts, and Dashboards. It\u00b4s an incredibly powerful combination that saves a lot of time, money and nerves.\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nThe Finance department immediately felt the main impact by extending the capabilities of Power BI with Power ON:\n\nQuarterly forecasts are now done in DAYS versus WEEKS, with greater accuracy.\nEliminated delays and the need to find/repair issues persistent with spreadsheets and Access db\u2014saving days of Finance and IT busy work.\nFinance staff can use freed-up time on value-add analysis for well-informed decision-making; ad-hoc analysis, detailed price calculation, etc.\n\nThe feedback from decision makers (from the CEO to facility heads) was also clear; they saw a high value in Power BI\u2019s easy to consume, role-based insight into the data.\nUltimately this culminates in Vienna BioCenter Core Facilities having better data to make faster, more informed decisions to foster research in the important field of life sciences.\n"

        "company": "sophub",
        "content": "\n About sophub\nsophub develops a proprietary cloud-based, machine learning, Demand, Financial, and S&OP Planning & Forecast engine that\u2019s used by 25% of Denmark\u2019s largest companies.\nsophub needed a full Demand and Inventory Planning solution to attract new customers, grow revenue and expand its Planning Business. Leveraging Microsoft Power BI was their top choice. After researching multiple Power BI write-back vendors, sharing the options with clients, and receiving resounding positive responses, they chose to partner with Power ON. The rest is history.\nTHE CHALLENGE\n\u201cWe wanted a complete, standardized solution that would help companies better understand their data and plan for the future,\u201d says Brian Byskov, CEO, sophub. \u201cWe\u2019d built the back-end and data model but still relied on a standard planning system at the front end.\u201d\nsophub\u2019s people, methodologies and technology effectively handled the demand and inventory planning for companies. However, customers that required demand and inventory planning would benefit from greater data visibility and transparency. They\u2019d also value the ability to handle millions of records, write-back and data aggregation/disaggregation in sophub\u2019s own logic.\nThe company wanted to enable its clients with forecast functionality and simplify master data management. Going forward, sophub was also interested in more advanced functionality, such as scenario planning and optimization; two process areas that could really help their clients.\n\nWe\u2019ve used Power BI since 2015 because so many of our customers rely on Microsoft solutions despite the fact Power BI doesn\u2019t support write-back, allow comments or aggregate and disaggregate data out-of-the-box,\u201d says Brian. \u201cI knew exactly what sophub and its customers needed \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t find it at the time.\n\nsophub initially tried building customized plug-ins for each customer, but found custom coding was costly and time consuming. While sophub and its customers could also use standalone planning apps like SAP, Kinaxis and Microsoft AX, they\u2019re built around their own logic adding more complexity and cost to supporting and maintaining them.\nFor sophub\u2019s customers, the total cost of ownership and the learning curve was also significant. Those legacy platforms can cost up to $2 million for the licensing, support and training. Because the legacy platforms are designed and built for everyone from retailers and manufacturers to service providers, these platforms typically offer 200 to 500 capabilities. In real life, most companies consistently use just five to 20 of the 100s of capabilities available to them. Even then, basic users need at least one week of training, and super users typically require six months. \u201cUsers are confused by the complexity and infinite variety of capabilities and so often these tools are over-engineered and not user-friendly,\u201d says Brian.\nOn a regular basis, different vendors told sophub they had solutions that could write-back to Power BI. However, when Brian investigated, he was profoundly disappointed \u2013 until he found Power ON.\nBEFORE Power ON\n\nPlan to expand business offerings and increase demand for services\nDesire to leverage Power BI skills and technology investments\nKnew Power BI lacked write-back and data aggregation capabilities\nHad trouble finding those capabilities in an existing tool\nTime-consuming and costly to build in-house\nSteep costs and learning curves with Legacy Platforms\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nPower ON stayed on my radar, and I soon discovered it\u2019s the only tool that delivers the core functionality sophub and its clients need. I showed clients what Power ON could do in Power BI and based on their positive responses, I wanted to partner with Power ON.\n\nsophub appreciates and respects Power ON because it\u2019s simple, easy to use, highly functional and very affordable.\n\u201cAt sophub, our mantra has always been \u2013 make it simple,\u201d says Brian. \u201cBut in real life, we know that is very difficult to do and that as a result, most tools are very complex and expensive.\u201d\nPower ON has the critical, core features sophub needed and then some. Power ON offers additional out-of-the-box functionality, including cell-level comments in Power BI, charting and scenario planning. And that\u2019s on top of the flexibility, real-time write-back to Power BI, aggregation, and disaggregation capabilities.\nNow fully integrated with sophub, Power ON offers a modular low-code tool set, which means sophub can quickly and easily build the new features their customers request. Customers get exactly what they want, and they get it in just a few hours instead of a few months. Before Power ON, it might have been impossible, or the client might get just a few of the features they wanted.\nWith Power ON\u2019s front-end, sophub presents the results in an easy planning board. sophub uses the write-back in Power BI as well as the scenario planning to present information in a format customers can easily absorb and understand. sophub\u2019s back-end uses machine-learning algorithms to analyze data, learn from different but similar cases and create valuable, actionable insights that support decision-making.\nTogether, Power ON\u2019s front-end in Power BI and sophub\u2019s back-end are competitive with standard planning systems and help users make more accurate plans and better decisions. Of course, they can also use sophub\u2019s demand and inventory planning services to further boost results.\nTHE RESULTS\n\nPower ON and sophub are the perfect match and provide an appealing, all-in-one demand and inventory planning solution.\n\nWe\u2019ve already grown 35% and are expecting further increases in revenue based on customers\u2019 reactions to sophub with Power ON.\n\nCustomers and prospects are interested in the sophub Power ON partnership because it costs 40 to 80% less than the custom and legacy alternatives. As importantly, it\u2019s immediately available with zero wait-time. The sophub Power ON solution requires just 4 hours of training compared to anywhere from 7 days to 6 months with other systems.\nThe efficiencies are also extraordinary! A few sophub employees can now use sophub\u2019s solution powered by Power ON to handle the manually intensive planning and data maintenance work that had been done by a chunk of customers\u2019 employees.\nAfter talking with Brian, prospects understand the potential ROI as well as the short- and long-term benefits to their top- and bottom-lines.\nHere\u2019s one real-life example: A major retailer with close to 100 stores saw a 2-month ROI (return on investment) in sophub\u2019s Demand and Inventory Planning with Power ON. The retailer used sophub and Power ON to more accurately assess the safety or buffer stock required to satisfy customers, saving Millions of Euros after reducing their inventory based on that data.\n\u201cWe all need to work in a slice and dice world to drill down and make decisions and act on the patterns we see,\u201d said Brian. With Power ON, sophub and its clients know exactly what happened in the market and even why it happened because of how they can see the data. Did they sell more of a particular product in a specific region due to seasonality or as a result of promotions and sales? They can also look ahead with forecasts and projections that can be adjusted thanks to Power ON.\nBecause of Power ON, sophub\u2019s new solution is the best option for the countless companies that already rely on Power BI. And when they have yet to commit to demand and inventory planning, sophub takes the opportunity to present its demand and inventory planning services.\n\u201cThey\u2019re open to sophub with Power ON because we show them we\u2019ll deliver the facts in a way that makes it easy to understand the risks and the opportunities, then make the correct decision for their businesses,\u201d says Brian.\nAFTER adding Power ON\n\nStrong synergistic partnership in place\nInstant access to proven write-back in Power BI plus data aggregation / disaggregation\n40 \u2013 80% cheaper and faster than custom building in-house\n40 \u2013 80% less costly than buying legacy system, training and support\nSignificantly enhanced customer experience\n35% improved growth & revenue\n\n\nOur customers tell us their employees can now use their time more effectively. For example, they\u2019re more available to talk to their clients, gather more information and make more sales.\n\n"

As one of the largest regionally based construction companies in Western Australia, Perkins Builders has a well-established reputation for building commercial, industrial, civil, education, and healthcare facilities that stand the test of time.\nNew Opportunities, New Challenges \nWhen Group Finance Manager, Octavia Woodfield, joined Perkins Builders, she already had a strong background in construction finance but faced new challenges learning how to manage an unfamiliar ERP and reporting processes. Perkins used Viewpoint Vista for enterprise resource planning and Spreadsheet Server from insightsoftware for financial reporting, a combination that Woodfield hadn\u2019t worked with previously but was excited to learn.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much software compared to back in the day when everything was manual,\u201d Octavia explained. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to manually feed data from one system to another; the data is pulled from the tables within the software.\u201d\nSimplified Reporting with a Single Source of Truth\nFinancial reporting is no small task for any business, but it can be particularly complicated for construction companies. It\u2019s not uncommon for organizations to need to pull data from three or more systems and dump it into Excel for formatting before a single financial report can be created.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really lucky, to come here where they already had Viewpoint Vista, and it\u2019s the main software we use,\u201d Octavia said. \u201cEveryone just puts their information into Vista, so I only have to deal with one software for my information source.\u201d\nWhile having only one ERP system to work with made learning the new software and processes easier, learning it was still a challenge. Thankfully, Spreadsheet Server was able to simplify the reporting process and ease Octavia\u2019s transition to Viewpoint Vista.\n\u201cWith Viewpoint, the financial reports are not the best, but when I found Spreadsheet Server on the other side of that, it actually made my life a lot easier. In fact, we don\u2019t use any of the financial reports that print or export from Vista; everything is done via Spreadsheet Server.\u201d\nOctavia prefers Spreadsheet Server for Perkins Builders\u2019 financial reporting because if offers:\n\nERP data exports directly to Excel \u2013 no manual downloads or data dumps\nReal-time data \u2013 ERP data automatically updates so data is never stale\nPre-formatted reports \u2013 building reports is easy with pre-built templates and a drag-and-drop report creator\n\n\u201cI can say I love my work more because of the software.\u201d\nTraining and Support Facilitate Better Outcomes\nProduct Education\nOctavia knew she faced a steep learning curve as a new user to both Viewpoint Vista and Spreadsheet Server. She found an excellent starting point in Spreadsheet Server\u2019s pre-built financial reports, as they made using the software immediately accessible, but Octavia was glad insightsoftware offers product training to support user success.\n\u201cWe organized some training so I could learn how to do the design side of it,\u201d said Octavia. \u201cI knew what I wanted when I did the training, so we built the first session around how to build custom report I needed and the next few sessions focused on troubleshooting \u2013 why are formulas not working as expected, etc.\u201d\nBy taking advantage of Spreadsheet Server product training and education, Octavia was able to begin immediately creating not just templated financial reports but custom payroll reports. Reporting processes that would have taken hours if done manually can now be done in minutes with Spreadsheet Server.\n\u201cWhat I do now that the model\u2019s been set up is literally change the date range, like this fortnight dates, and run the worksheet. All the data goes in the table automatically,\u201d Octavia explains. \u201cIf I were to run the report in Viewpoint, I would actually need to run quite a few reports and none of those come to Excel in the format that you want them in to be usable; I\u2019d have to reformat them all.\u201d\nProduct Support\nPart of Octavia\u2019s success in learning Spreadsheet Server has been due to the accessibility of support services from insightsoftware. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get support,\u201d she said in reference to her previous software solutions. \u201cI had to go through their website to learn how to use it, but there was not a person on the other side that said, \u2018this is what you do, this is how you do it.\u2019 In contrast, the experience I\u2019ve had with Spreadsheet Server has been so much better.\u201d\nSpreadsheet Server provides client support such as:\n\nAnswering product questions\nTroubleshooting issues and errors\nRegular communication of updates\nResource sharing within a user community\n\n\u201cHaving that support, it\u2019s amazing just being able to open a case or go into the community, have a look and see what other people have done,\u201d Octavia says. \u201cI don\u2019t have programming skills, and you don\u2019t need programming skills with Spreadsheet Server. There\u2019s help there and you can get as much or as little as you need to be able to build your own reports.\u201d\nPlans for the Future\nNow that Octavia has mastered financial reporting and payroll reporting with Spreadsheet Server, her next goal is to improve project reporting and further streamline reporting processes at Perkins Builders. She also plans to share her knowledge with her team as she continues mastering skills within Spreadsheet Server. By encouraging her team to take advantage of ongoing training and support, she hopes to further enhance collaboration and efficiency.\nTo see how Spreadsheet Server and insightsoftware\u2019s training and support services can help your organization, schedule a demo today.\n"

        "content": "\nIn Brief\n\nWilliam Hill has been a loyal insightsoftware customer for 20 years\nThe organization is migrating from JDE to Oracle ERP Cloud\nOracle\u2019s native reporting tools could not meet finance team needs\nWilliam Hill partnered with insightsoftware to consult in the building of Angles Professional to solve its reporting challenges\nWilliam Hill is already elevating its reporting game with Angles Professional, smoothing over many pain points associated with cloud migration\n\nWilliam Hill is one of the world\u2019s leading betting and gaming companies, employing over 12,500 people. Its origins are in the UK where it was founded in 1934, and where the company is listed on the London Stock Exchange. With headquarters in London and Leeds it has a national presence of licensed betting offices in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In 2022, William Hill was acquired by 888 Holdings plc, another global leader in online betting and gaming.\nFor many years, William Hill\u2019s financial processes revolved around its JD Edwards ERP, backed by the reporting power of Hubble. Users loved the in-depth, real-time reporting capabilities offered by Hubble. The pre-built content enabled Finance users to self-serve when they needed a new report from JDE. This collaborative approach fostered a strong and innovative partnership. When it came time for William Hill to migrate to Oracle Cloud, Head of Group Finance Systems, Vip Sharma, knew it was time to seek a cloud application that could reduce the impact of this transition and eventually elevate his team\u2019s reporting and analytics capabilities.\n\u201cWe saw the opportunities migrating to a cloud ERP could provide, but really didn\u2019t want our reporting to take a step back,\u201d said Vip. \u201cTransitioning to all new systems is hard on the team and you tend to see a lag or drop in reporting due to the steep learning curve. We recognized that integrating a new reporting tool could dramatically reduce the time it would take to start seeing value from our new data system.\u201d\nNative Tools Couldn\u2019t Deliver\nWhile Oracle ERP Cloud comes with its own native reporting tool (OTBI), Vip found that this would not offer the full range of capabilities that his team had become accustomed to with Hubble.\n\u201cAt William Hill, we have not used a development team to drive reporting output from JDE. It is not an efficient or sustainable model for a finance department who require instant information at period ends,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe key to choosing Angles revolved around the need for a similar end user tool that could not only serve the finance team, but elevate it to the next level and produce KPIs and dashboards directly from within the reporting tool.\u201d\n\u201cOTBI is a technical tool, which isn\u2019t flexible enough for my users and has very little pre-built content,\u201d Vip continued. \u201cIt would require a lot of work post migration to get back to where we left off with Hubble and I didn\u2019t want those challenges delaying the team\u2019s output. We needed a true end user reporting solution that would make it easy for Finance to get reports and KPIs from the new system.\u201d\n\u201cWe had been successfully using Hubble over JDE for over 20 years and were keen to stay with insightsoftware if we could make it work. The kicker was that I wanted to improve, not just maintain, our reporting capabilities. The new tool had to be more advanced, intuitive, and flexible than anything we\u2019d used before. I presented this idea to our partners at insightsoftware and it became clear that we were on a path to developing an all-new tool together, specifically to overcome the reporting challenges of an Oracle Cloud migration.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting process, developing Angles Professional for Oracle Cloud in partnership with insightsoftware. They listened to my team\u2019s needs and are building a solution that solves many major pain points I know are common across our industry.\u201d\nAn Angle for Success\nAfter working closely with Vip, we gave his team a demo of our new financial and operational reporting solution, Angles Professional, and they were blown away.\n\u201cAs soon as we saw Angles\u2019 sleek opening interface, we knew that it was the right cloud tool to support our ERP migration. insightsoftware had done a great job building and enabling a base of pre-built reports that were tailored to our business needs. It was clear that after a bit of training, the team would not have to miss a beat to start generating value from our new ERP.\u201d\nThere were a few big-ticket features that made Angles Professional the obvious choice for William Hill.\n\nPre-built content. The chosen solution needed to provide the team with all the basic reports required to maintain output throughout the migration. Angles Professional provided all this and more, immediately offering the team AP, AR and purchasing reports.\nMulti data source connectivity. William Hill stores data across multiple systems and spreadsheets. Angles can combine this data with live actuals to give the team a real-time view of business health.\nUser friendly. Angles offered the team an elevated, modern reporting and analysis user experience. This was very exciting for them as they can now generate engaging visualizations, KPI reports and comprehensive report packs.\nNo more Excel data dumps. Angles connects directly to source data in Oracle Cloud, as well as an array of other data sources, removing the need for the team to manually extract or upload data. This is a huge time saver and gives them a single source of truth from Oracle Cloud.\nSelf-service capabilities. The team at William Hill can now seek answers to their own reporting questions with Angles\u2019 intuitive reporting that makes it easy to slice and dice data to dive deeper into costs. Drag-and-drop editing, rich visualizations and intuitive interactivity allow users to refresh their reports at any time so they can explore the latest data to get timely answers to their key questions.\nTrust in data. Angles reports connect directly to source data, significantly boosting trust in the results. No more double-checking spreadsheets for errors or submitting analysis that\u2019s already a week old. The key stakeholders at William Hill are now confident in the accuracy of results.\n\nLooking to the Future\nWilliam Hill is gearing up to implement its new ERP, Oracle Cloud, while continuing the ongoing successful partnership with insightsoftware team to optimize Angles Professional and build out its functionality. In the future, Vip would like to combine all data sources through Angles, offering a true single source of financial and operational information across the entire business. As his team\u2019s skills grow, he sees the use-cases for Angles expanding to touch more areas of finance and the business at large.\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about how Angles Professional can streamline your financial and operational reporting and analysis, please visit our website to set up a demo.\n"

        "content": "\n\nHighlights\n\nSaved over 1,000 hours per year on organizing rescue efforts\nEstablished a COVID-19 dashboard within just two weeks\nAutomated scheduling and messaging to coordinate rescue volunteers\nConnected with critical external data sources in a single dashboard\n\nIn Southern England, remote locations and uneven terrain can be difficult for emergency services to navigate during tough weather conditions. That\u2019s when the 4\u00d74 vehicle owners who volunteer as part of the Hants & Berks 4\u00d74 Response team come to the rescue\u201424 hours a day, 365 days a year. These responders dedicate their time and four-wheel-drive vehicles to help rescue or transport emergency workers and supplies through weather-beaten terrain in the region during disasters and emergencies.\nAn Urgent Request for Process Automation\nWhen Axel Seedig stepped up to become the Chief Team Controller for Hants & Berks 4\u00d74 Response, he inherited a process founded on an Excel spreadsheet that needed automation. A business analyst by profession, Seedig developed their Responder Manager application using Microsoft Access in an attempt to optimize their processes. Even so, he faced several challenges:\n\nOutdated manual process. The controller team had to copy the necessary information from an Excel spreadsheet cell-by-cell into their Access database.\nInability to scale. As news about the charity circulated, the number of 4\u00d74 volunteers grew 60 percent, making it difficult for the controllers to manage the extra workload.\nSevere inefficiencies. The team lost about three hours each morning managing the volunteer and transport details for that day.\nRestricted access. With three controllers working in different locations within the region, the Access database became difficult to use because, at any time, only one controller could connect to the data.\n\nSeedig was familiar with Logi Symphony because his employer had used it for case management and technical support reporting. He explained, \u201cHaving\nseen how my employer used it, I recognized its powerful capabilities, so I approached Logi Symphony about sponsoring a license for our charity. After I showed them the basic Responder Manager program I created, they agreed their solution could optimize our operations. The license they donated to our cause was the start of a successful partnership.\u201d\nAccess to Multiple Data Sources\nAdding Logi Symphony to the Responder Manager program required minimal effort. Seedig stated, \u201cThe solution is highly flexible and ensures a rapid\ndevelopment of complex functionality within the application. Because of the comprehensive object-oriented development platform, I don\u2019t need to code a user interface. If I had to write everything in PHP or something similar, it would be a nightmare.\u201d He added, \u201cIf you\u2019re familiar with SQL and style sheets, anything is possible with Logi Symphony.\u201d\nThe Hants & Berks 4\u00d74 controllers use Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise for its performance and flexibility when making efficient database queries. \u201cThis combination was relatively easy to integrate with Logi Symphony, whereas other solutions failed,\u201d said Seedig.\nHe stated that a big advantage of using Logi Symphony is the ability to connect to the third-party data that keeps them in compliance with the public liability insurance requirements for each responder. Their database stores the information about the responders and customers\u2014such as hospitals and home care facilities\u2014who request their services.\nA Wealth of Information From a Single Dashboard\n\u201cFrom our dashboard, we can see essential information about each rescue case, each volunteer, the schedule, and much more. We can also see how many cases our team worked on, how many miles they traveled to the rescue site, and how many responders were involved. With all of that information, Logi Symphony makes it easy to pull it all together in the application so we can work with it,\u201d Seedig said.\nAnd, when the COVID-19 virus hit, Seedig was able to update the dashboard within just two weeks to include the critical authorization and reporting information they needed to track pandemic-related services.\nCritical information from multiple sources\nFrom the dashboard, the 4\u00d74 controllers can access a wealth of critical information as it pertains to each request. For example, they can see weather information from the Met Office (national meteorological service for the UK); flooding information from the Environment Agency; and road closures, congestion, and construction site information from Highways Agency (England\u2019s\ngovernment company who maintains motorways). They can also link to maps by using a Google plug-in to check responder availability based on postal code and to direct responders to the safest route for the designated location.\nTransparent and accurate reporting\nThe controllers can now include summary reports about the services they provided along with their customer invoices. Seedig said, \u201cOur customers are\nreally happy with the reporting process and accuracy because everything is transparent for them. They\u2019re also impressed with how quickly we can deliver results.\u201d\nAutomated scheduling and messaging\nThe controller team can now manage scheduling from the dashboard. They can easily drill down to know which volunteers and controllers are available and when for planning purposes. In a similar way, they can create email or SMS messages when an urgent request comes in and track the responses that come back from the volunteers.\nMore time to handle additional transport-related\nservices\nAccording to Seedig, \u201cWhat used to take our controllers about 3 hours every day now takes 5 minutes.\u201d The additional time has enabled the Hants & Berks 4\u00d74 team to better serve their communities by transporting nurses and healthcare workers to look after their patients in remote or hard-to-reach areas. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, the team expanded services to help residents in these areas during the lockdown by delivering food, urgent prescriptions, medical supplies, and personal protective equipment.\nA Versatile and Superior Solution\nThe Hants & Berks 4\u00d74 Response controllers have made an impression with the greater 4\u00d74 Response team for the United Kingdom. The management team in particular appreciates the more meaningful information in the statistical-based reports. Seedig said, \u201cOur Responder Manager application is a versatile and superior tool because of Logi Symphony. The flexibility and performance that Logi Symphony provides is outstanding. For the doubters, we can assure them Logi Symphony isn\u2019t just another BI tool. It\u2019s the most flexible and comprehensive platform for web-based application development.\n"

        "content": "\nIn Brief\n\nChoate Construction Company experienced strong growth but needed to update their tools and processes to scale\nManual reporting process consumed valuable finance team time\nWith Spreadsheet Server, the company was able to automate its manual reporting processes\nQuery Designer allowed Choate to create reports custom-tailored to business needs without deep technical knowledge.\nChoate Construction Company reduced reporting prep time from 45 minutes to 10 minutes per report.\n\nFounded in 1989, Choate Construction Company was a basement start-up during a recession when construction projects were sparse, and the employee roster was small. Today, Choate Construction employs 550+ full-time professionals and is 100% employee owned.\nChoate is a leader in financially viable and functional construction solutions. By investing in tools to promote advances in safety, virtual construction, sustainable construction, preconstruction, and risk mitigation, Choate is on the forefront of industry standards.\nAs one of the largest general contractors in the Southeast United States, Choate considers its reputation to be its number one asset, with future success founded upon the strength of employees and client relationships.\nBogged Down by Manual Processes\nPreviously, Choate Construction\u2019s reporting process consisted of an array of manual steps. Project managers would print out reports from Viewpoint Vista, assemble physical pages of disparate information together, scan them into a single PDF document, then email the documents to Steve McDaniel, Controller at Choate Construction Company.\n\u201cOur process hadn\u2019t changed since our company started in 1989,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cIt was a very manual process. Even with minimal changes in any particular month, it would take at least 45 minutes to prepare a single report.\u201d\nProject managers at Choate often manage six or more projects at a time. With such a time-consuming process, reporting would consume several hours per project manager every month. It also ran the risk of human error. With over 100 project managers running reports, McDaniel estimated the company would spend nearly 170 hours per month on reporting alone.\n\u201cEach month, I\u2019d get close to 200 job reports,\u201d McDaniel explained. \u201cIf you took the amount of time these project managers took to prepare job reports, 45 minutes for each of the 225 projects, it was a time-consuming process for everyone.\u201d\nIntroducing Spreadsheet Server\u2019s Query Designer\nBecause Choate\u2019s monthly reporting consumed well over a hundred hours each month, McDaniel needed a more automated reporting process so that project managers would no longer be bogged down by manual steps. In 2016, the company sought technology that would enable it to:\n\nReduce reporting cycles.\nWork in a familiar, Excel-based format.\nSave time from repetitive, manual work.\nIntegrate easily with Viewpoint Vista.\nEnable Choate to create its own custom PTC/job report.\nCreate a one-stop shop where project managers could monitor job progress\n\nChoate discovered the solution it needed was Spreadsheet Server, specifically for its Query Designer feature.\n\u201cWe had not found another program we felt would do everything we needed it to do,\u201d said McDaniel. \u201cWe were introduced to Spreadsheet Server in 2016. At first, we were able to do some general ledger inquiry reports, then we were introduced to the fact we could build out our PTC report through Query Designer around 2018. In 2019-early 2020, we were able to roll out a finished product \u2013 our custom PTC report \u2013 to all our employees.\u201d\nResults\nSpreadsheet Server\u2019s Query Designer drastically reduced project managers\u2019 workloads while empowering the company with the ability to create its own custom reports. Here\u2019s how:\n\nSpreadsheet Server saved project managers 135 hours per month on reporting.\nQuery Designer allowed McDaniel to create a PTC report tailored to Choate\u2019s custom needs with little technical knowledge.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an accountant. I don\u2019t know code. Without that background, Query Designer has been amazing.\u201d \u2013 Steve McDaniel, Controller at Choate Construction Company\u00a0\n\nA Custom Query for the Entire Company\nQuery Designer by Spreadsheet Server allowed McDaniel to custom tailor his own query in the form of Choate\u2019s proprietary PTC reports. Project managers run these reports to track and report on specific contracts and clients. Because this is a custom report built for Choate, no ERP-native reporting tool could have fulfilled this specific need.\n\u201cThe PTC report we created with Query Designer has introduced tremendous efficiencies to our process,\u201d said Matt McGarry, Project Executive at Choate Construction. \u201cNot only has it combined what used to be several separate documents into a single and easily accessible file, but it has also allowed us to implement a dashboard that incorporates both current and past financial data. It even includes graphs and other visual indicators that clearly organize, track, and display critical data. These improvements have allowed us to conduct more consistent and thorough reviews, in less time, and with fewer errors or oversight than before.\u201d\nStreamlined Manual Processes\nAfter an hourlong training session, project managers at Choate Construction rolled out their new reporting tool. The PTC report McDaniel designed allows data to be pulled directly from Viewpoint Vista and requires no manual entry, cutting report preparation time from 45 minutes to 10 minutes each. Project managers are in full control of a more automated reporting process, afforded a real-time view of their job data that they can refresh at any time.\n\u201cWith this new report we have, it can be updated and ready to be submitted within 10 minutes. With 200+ reports, there are 130-140 hours saved on a monthly basis,\u201d McDaniel said.\nImproved Data Culture\nSpreadsheet Server equipped Choate\u2019s project managers with real-time reports they can generate within minutes \u2013 all without the need for IT intervention. Spreadsheet Server offered Choate a single version of the truth with trusted data, vastly improving the company-wide data culture. Important decisions made using the reports Choate uses are based on consistent, reliable, and accurate information straight from Viewpoint Vista.\n\u201cSpreadsheet server has reduced the opportunity for data entry mistakes,\u201d explained Matt Matthews, Project Executive at Choate Construction. \u201cIn the past our staff would have to pull financial information from several sources and manually add them to our cover sheet which was a standard Excel sheet. Not only was this a timely process but opened the door for mistakes. With Spreadsheet server, that process is automatic, thus saving time while eliminating mistakes.\u201d\n"

The pharmaceuticals that save lives and improve quality of life go through rigorous research, development, and testing for years before ever hitting shelves. For Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, the lengthy and arduous process is just a fact of life and a cost of doing business.\nThe company has spent nearly a century focusing on creating solutions for better health worldwide. Today, Otsuka delivers innovative neuroscience, oncology, cardio-renal medicines, and medical devices to more than 30 countries. But as its business footprint has grown, so have the challenges of delivering new products to an ever-growing list of global markets.\n\u201cEach country has its own authority that oversees product safety testing, reporting, and the decision about whether or not a product can go to market,\u201d says Rajesh Pandey, Associate Director of the Safety Data Management (SDM) Group at Otsuka. \u201cWe wanted to find a way to collect and organize the required data for each country\u2019s regulators faster and make sure that the information we reported is as accurate as possible.\u201d\nThe Complex World of Global Compliance\nGetting a new product to market\u2014and keeping it there\u2014is a lengthy and time-consuming process. Otsuka must put all its products through rigorous clinical trials and testing for safety and efficacy, compiling data from patients participating in trials around the world and meticulously recording each outcome\u2014positive or adverse\u2014for regulators to evaluate.\nData must be aggregated, analyzed, and organized into specific reporting formats for government authorities in every market in weekly, monthly, and annual intervals. In the past, Otsuka relied on manually driven, disparate processes to aggregate the data required by the various governing and regulatory bodies.\n\u201cWe had colleagues in each region of the world collecting and building as many as 60 different reports, lists, and tables for every governing body,\u201d Pandey says. \u201cThe sheer volume of work and the fact that our data has to be accurately made it extremely difficult to continuously meet deadlines to remain fully compliant.\u201d\nPandey says that regulators occasionally granted extensions for extenuating circumstances, and Otsuka regularly contracted additional resources to help manage the workload. \u201cExtensions and hiring more people were short-term solutions to a long-term challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the number of reports we have to produce, it became imperative to find ways to bring greater efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and consistency to our operations.\u201c\nEssential Reports Without Delay\nEager for a new approach to meeting its varying compliance standards, the Otsuka team gathered consultants and colleagues to brainstorm ways to consolidate and streamline data collection and reporting.\nAfter developing new data collection processes, the team needed a software solution to put it into action and standardize its reporting activities. The company evaluated solutions from several well-known vendors but chose to deploy Logi Symphony because of its compatibility with legacy data systems, intuitive setup, and automated operations.\nLogi Symphony seamlessly integrates with Otsuka\u2019s Oracle database and Argus pharmacovigilance platform application to greatly accelerate reporting time-to-delivery and help to ensure that the data the company uses for reports is completely accurate. Unlike other solutions, Logi Symphony doesn\u2019t require intermediate data modeling processes to create reports, which can jeopardize data integrity while also adding critical hours or days to the reporting function.\n\u201cLogi Symphony lets us skip data handling steps that add unnecessary time and risk to our operations,\u201d Pandey says. \u201cNot only can we be sure that the information we\u2019re providing is as accurate as possible, but we\u2019re also able to schedule automatic report delivery and make sure we don\u2019t miss a reporting deadline that could result in a non-compliant status, costly audits, or even having to suspend operations in a particular market.\u201d\nNew Tools of the Trade\nOne of the biggest advantages of using Logi Symphony is the ease and speed with which Otsuka can create new reports and formats. Otsuka team members use the tool to rapidly design and deploy a range of interactive, elegant reports to meet the individual requirements and demands of international regulators as well as internal stakeholders.\nIn the past, reports had to be created locally, with Otsuka employees in each region responsible for collecting information, collaborating with local authorities, and trying to organize them into specific report layouts as dictated by regulatory agencies. With Logi Symphony, those tasks are centralized. Pandey\u2019s team can generate an array of reports covering topics such as patient medication reactions and trial outcomes at the individual participant level and lay the data out to regulators\u2019 exact specifications for more than 30 markets.\nLogi Symphony\u2019s intuitive interface enables virtually any Otsuka employee to easily select the appropriate data sources, create specific queries, and design a layout to a governing agency\u2019s specifications. The software\u2019s drag-and-drop functionality lets the report developer choose from over 40 types of charts, tables, crosstabs, and other components to customize the look and feel of the reports and make essential information easier to read.\n\u201cLogi Symphony is an easy and light tool that lets anyone in our organization become a report designer with very little training,\u201d Pandey says. \u201cWith just a handful of resources, we\u2019re able to push out nearly 300 different outputs for internal use and create more thorough reports for external audiences from a single platform.\u201d\nEnhanced Productivity and Greater Reporting Transparency\nDeploying Logi Symphony has helped Otsuka modernize and simplify its complex reporting responsibilities. In contrast to the disparate and disjointed manual processes of the past, Logi Symphony unifies and automates many of the most time-consuming data collection and reporting tasks. Now, Otsuka can remain compliant and competitive across its geographic centers of operation with less effort, in less time.\nPandey says that his team no longer requires extensions on report deadlines and has significantly improved its resource management. \u201cOur productivity overall has increased by more than 300% since deploying Logi Symphony,\u201d he says. \u201cReports and presentations that used to take two months to compile now take less than two weeks because every aspect of the process is simpler and more straightforward.\u201d\nThe increased efficiency has not only saved Otsuka a lot of time but has also helped the company avoid the financial calamity that comes with unverified data and failure to comply with regulatory standards. Pandey says that the consequences of non-compliance can devastate a company because of the cost to redo the work, hefty fines, and other penalties, which can easily reach tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.\n"

Its products are used in pipelines, power plants, refineries, chemical plants, and gas plants around the world.\nThe Challenge\nWhen it comes to manufacturing, it\u2019s safe to say there are a lot of moving parts. Each Taylor Forge project requires the custom engineering and coordination of dozens of tasks across five different departments. And at any given time, the company has up to 50 projects underway and 800 to 900 parts coming in from suppliers.\nMoreover, engineers routinely work on multiple projects with varying schedules, so they must constantly reevaluate the priority of their tasks \u2013 often making it difficult for them to stay on track to meet their deadlines.\nAccording to Rick Pysher, Chief Operating Officer of Taylor Forge, \u201cAs the company grew, we found our delivery performance was degrading. When we evaluated the causes, we found a lot of it was on the front end, so it quickly became clear that we needed a tool that would provide transparency for each of our projects and enable us to easily dispatch priorities to individual engineers.\u201d\nIn 2007, Taylor Forge began utilizing an enterprise resource planning tool, but quickly found it had shortcomings \u2013 especially on the planning and scheduling side. So they began looking for an analytics solution that would fill in the gaps.\n\u201cInitially, the main driver for looking at advanced analytical tools was mainly around providing easier access to schedule information to help us coordinate tasks across groups, and being able to update that information in real-time.\u201d\nThe Solution\nTo find the right approach, Taylor Forge turned to Trabon Solutions, an IT consulting and application development firm, who worked to develop the company\u2019s BI strategy and software requirements. After evaluating four different software options, Trabon recommended Logi Symphony based on its attractive mix of features, ease of use, and flexible pricing model.\nAfter evaluating four different software options, Trabon recommended Logi Symphony based on its attractive mix of features, ease of use, and flexible pricing model. Logi Symphony could also be easily integrated within Taylor Forge\u2019s ERP system, where the majority of information for the dashboards \u2013 such as supplier specifics and performance, internal project execution activities, sales efforts, and more \u2013 would come from.\n\u201cPeople just want information, and Logi Symphony has satisfied the needs of all our employees,\u201d Mr. Pysher explains. \u201cWhereas our people used to have to go to multiple screens and modules in the ERP to see all this data, we\u2019re now bringing it together in one snapshot within the dashboard.\u201d\nThe Results\nBy providing a complete picture of operations, Logi Symphony has enabled Taylor Forge to identify and resolve previously hidden constraints to timely deliveries. With the insights gained, the company has been able to reengineer its processes for more consistent execution.\n\u201cHistorically, we would uncover an issue late in the process, and fixing it would take a long time. Logi Symphony has helped us tremendously with the analysis and visibility of data across the organization. Before, we wouldn\u2019t see monthly data until two to three weeks into the following month; with Logi Symphony, it\u2019s just a day or two at the close of the month.\u201d\nTaylor Forge engineers now have better clarity of individual tasks and the influence each task has on their delivery times. The dashboard helps them to easily prioritize key project variables and tasks necessary to complete their projects on time \u2013 a process that used to be done manually and was very time-consuming.\nLogi Symphony has helped Taylor Forge implement a \u201cpush system\u201d as opposed to the pull system they\u2019ve had in the past. In other words, says Mr. Pysher, \u201cSomething happens and you actively are sending emails to people saying you have a problem and you need to fix it. People are now accustomed to seeing yellow and red flags and realizing that\u2019s where they need to focus their time and effort.\u201d\nSince implementing Logi Symphony, Taylor Forge has improved their on-time delivery rate by 10 percent and has reduced lead times by 10 to 15 percent in the process. This has ultimately enabled the company to increase capacity and respond to new client opportunities with confidence.\nAll this success has created a culture where Taylor Forge employees now embrace data-driven insights and actively seek out opportunities for continuous improvement. They are now in the process of using Logi Symphony\u2019s write-back capabilities to update their ERP system with new data, essentially eliminating all paper-based transactions.\n\u201cWhen we started down this path, we knew it would make a difference; but we couldn\u2019t have ever imagined how far we\u2019d be able to take it. Everything used to be handwritten; now it\u2019s all online, written back to tables, and easily accessible. We can now analyze the data and the root causes. It\u2019s all done in the background automatically in real-time.\u201d\n"

With 35 years of experience developing business systems software for the heavy-duty truck market, the company serves more than 1,500 sales, service, and parts locations across North America.\nThe Challenge\nKarmak needed an analytics solution to replace Business Intelligence, the reporting platform built for their legacy business systems. Developed and iterated over the past 13 years, Business Intelligence provides real-time self-service reporting capabilities to Karmak customers at many disparate locations and with a wide range of technical expertise.\nAs analytics solutions have evolved over the years, Karmak slowly updated Business Intelligence, improving its look and feel and adding new features. However, this \u201cbolt-on\u201d approach proved inadequate for keeping pace with their customers\u2019 demands for next-generation data reporting capabilities.\nThe Solution\nKarmak decided to embed Self-Service from Logi Symphony because it enabled them to offer the same level of functionality and would quickly update the user interface of their tool.\n\u201cWe were able to take the Logi Symphony solution out of the box without modifying a lot,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIt gave us ease of use and helped to update the look and feel of our reporting solution when compared to Business Intelligence. We didn\u2019t have to go through the process of redesigning the system ourselves.\u201d\nThe joining capabilities of SSM were a big draw for Karmak because their Legacy solution didn\u2019t allow users to join data objects across components. Additionally, Karmak appreciated Logi Symphony\u2019s out-of-the-box support for multiple web platforms (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox).\nThey were also able to integrate SSM with their business system permission structure so users could continue using their login credentials from the legacy application.\nThe Results\nAbout 90 Karmak customers are now using the next-generation tool, Fusion Report Writer. These customers encompass a wide range of users, and SSM is easily accessible to all of them, regardless of their role or skill level. For instance, executives and dealership owners may use the tool to view dashboards on high-level accounting data; service managers might want to see the number of open repair orders at their shops and create their dashboards based on this data; and technicians prefer to see this data on an even more granular level so they know what orders to fill next.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a range of feedback so far that the look and feel of the solution and the ease of building dashboards and charts is really a step ahead,\u201d Gardner said.\nGardner explained that certain customers prefer to designate an IT expert to implement the tool and distribute custom reports to their users. However, at the same time, many customers want the ability to give individuals access to build their reports using managed data sets\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what SSM enables them to do.\n"

        "content": "\nOverview\nChallenges:\n\nProviding top-notch actionable intelligence for financial institutions to detect fraud\nAlerting executives to potential criminal activities\nCustomizing reports to ensure financial institutions remain compliant with regulations\n\nSolution:\nNICE Actimize leverages Logi Symphony to help compliance officers and business managers understand patterns to help fine-tune their crime detection efficiencies. Once alerts enter the investigation process, Logi Symphony helps with workload optimization by allowing managers to easily access on-demand statistics for providing oversight.\nBenefits:\n\nImproves criminal detection based on more accurate and thoroughly analyzed data\nSave NICE Actimize hundreds of hours of development time\nProvides simple-to-use reporting and dashboards for customized business intelligence\nHelp NICE Actimize customers avoid lengthy training time\n\nEnterprise Fraud Prevention software provider embeds Logi Symphony to instill brilliant, crime-stopping intelligence into financial institutions.\nFIGHTING CRIME WITH SOFTWARE\nCrime stoppers come in many guises\u2014not all wear a badge. Criminals also hide in plain view\u2014sometimes inside an organization. Financial institutions in particular must be wary of fraudulent activities and report these issues to law enforcement. Fortunately, NICE Actimize is on the lookout and can help protect financial enterprises against potential crimes.\nNICE Actimize is a leading global provider of enterprise software solutions for anti-money laundering, enterprise fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance. Eight of the top ten financial services organizations, as well as regulatory and government agencies, use NICE Actimize Enterprise Risk Case Management to fight crime within their banks, brokerages, and insurance firms. In total, the company provides surveillance and compliance monitoring for over US$8 trillion in assets.\nThe company helps to mitigate risk by providing a unified dashboard that enables customers to assess business exposures, identify irregular events and workflows across the enterprise, and improve insight into customer behaviors.\nHowever, the company\u2019s proprietary solution needs to run continuously in the background to seek out suspicious activity over time and across multiple transactions. Eventually, the tool was unable to keep up with the demands for complex conglomerations of disparate data. The company needed a scalable, integrated reporting and dashboard tool capable of reliably accessing multiple data sources and enabling users to visualize the information easily for faster and better decision-making.\nTIMELY, RELEVANT INTELLIGENCE NEEDED FOR SURVEILLANCE\nNICE Actimize customers require a heavy-duty, but simple-to-use business intelligence solution that empowers security analysts and business leaders to uncover and address surreptitious threats. Since the company didn\u2019t have an alliance with a business intelligence software provider, it wanted to establish a partnership that could provide an embeddable, Web-based reporting tool that integrates into the company\u2019s existing anti-fraud and regulatory compliance software architecture.\n\u201cOur goal has always been to provide the most relevant and timely information to our customers to help them detect and prevent fraudulent and non-compliant activities,\u201d says Ido Ophir, VP of Product Management at NICE Actimize. \u201cTo accomplish that, we needed to make it easier for our customers to access, visualize, and analyze that information.\u201d\nAs cybercrime in the financial sector continued to increase in frequency and complexity, NICE Actimize aimed to strengthen its regulatory compliance capabilities to help banks and financial institutions avoid steep fines and other punitive actions if they failed to submit Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) regularly. Ophir wanted a solution that could instill actionable business intelligence into their Enterprise Risk Case Manager software.\nAlthough the reporting interface had to be simple and easy to use, the actual visual output needed to present complex concepts and models so financial managers could act quickly to protect their enterprises against threats. To Ophir, in addition to rich visualizations, customized dashboards, and dynamic interactive reports were essential features the company needed to deliver to help customers stay ahead of the threat curve.\nSHINING A LIGHT ON CRIMINALS TO SAFEGUARD FINANCIAL SYSTEMS\nNICE Actimize looked at several business intelligence and reporting solutions, but chose Logi Symphony because of its seamless integration, intuitive use, and intelligent flexibility. Powered by the Analytics Intelligence Server engine, Enterprise Risk Case Manager leverages Logi Symphony\u2019s advanced visualization capabilities to help identify suspicious activity over time and across multiple transactions, geographies, and business entities.\nWith Logi Symphony, NICE Actimize customers can easily create an array of canned reports featuring different formats and varying levels of detail about their transactions with virtually no training. The solution\u2019s drag-and-drop interface enables customers to rapidly create interactive, actionable charts with side-by-side comparisons and dynamic filtering for richer data analysis and faster decision-making.\nAs a Java-based solution, Logi Symphony can embed right into NICE Actimize\u2019s front-end UI for a seamless user experience. More importantly, the solution ties effortlessly into virtually any data source and can mash up information from multiple data sources simultaneously, enabling developers to deliver concise views of disparate fraud mitigation data in a single report or dashboard.\n\u201cWith Logi Symphony, we\u2019re providing customers immediate access to richer, more valuable statistical information than ever before, right out of the box,\u201d says Ophir. \u201cCustomers can view data in dozens of preconfigured reports or build their own with a few clicks of their mouse.\u201d\nThe combination of powerful features in Enterprise Risk Case Manager and the flexible reporting in Logi Symphony means NICE Actimize customers can instantly produce easy-to-read, interactive reports that help business leaders determine the best course of action for managing business threats and report them promptly to the proper authorities. Now, key decision-makers have greater visibility into various aspects of the organization that may be susceptible to criminal activity. With the right security in place, the resulting analytics can be shared over the Web or viewed on mobile devices to allow team members throughout an organization to proactively address potential fraudulent activity and non-compliant behaviors.\nVISIBILITY INTO MONEY LAUNDERING AND OTHER FRAUD\nAdopting Logi Symphony as the foundation for its reporting activities has helped NICE Actimize improve the health of its business and strengthen its customers\u2019 abilities to protect their own. The software\u2019s custom report building saves NICE Actimize hundreds of hours in development time by providing self-service tools for end users. As a result, Ophir and his team can allocate those resources to higher-value activities such as building out new features that ultimately enhance the customer experience.\nAt the same time, NICE Actimize customers are also reaping the benefits of a unified reporting and analysis platform. With Logi Symphony, companies can produce a cohesive visual display of curated and centralized data, providing deeper visibility into all transactions to spot crime and help ensure compliance and operational oversight. The solution offers greater transparency by ensuring events are resolved per a financial institution\u2019s standard policy or that they are escalated promptly, including the creation of an audit trail for future reference and possible remediation steps.\nMeanwhile, the intuitive nature and consistent user experience provided by the platform means that NICE Actimize customers can limit the amount of time and money they need to spend on end-user training. Now, more employees across more departments leverage embedded business intelligence to detect and report suspicious activities to the authorities to crack down on unauthorized transactions and avoid steep penalties for non-compliance.\n"

        "company": "H&J Martin",
        "content": "\nAt a Glance\nThe Customer: H&J Martin Asset Management Services\nThe Challenge: Struggling to combine data from multiple analysis applications:\n\nHad to export data into Excel, which only occurred once a month\n\nThe Results: Met with departments to understand their analytic requirements:\n\nAble to see all data in one place, and have standardized reporting\nCan identify inefficiencies and take corrective action, as well as measure performance and productivity\n\nAbout H&J Martin\nFounded in 1840, H&J Martin is a construction company headquartered in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In April 2015, they joined the Lagan Construction Group of companies and now operate two main divisions. H&J Martin Asset Management Services delivers minor works, planned and reactive maintenance, and facilities management services. Construction & Fit Out provides construction services, interior fit out, and refurbishment to the leisure, office, and retail sectors throughout the UK and Ireland.\nThe Challenge\nOne of the biggest challenges for almost every organization is finding that single version of the truth. With separate applications for all of its core functions, from computer facilities management to document management and billing, the H&J Martin Asset Management Services division was struggling to combine all its data for analysis. To gain a complete view of the business, the division had to manually export data from each system and bring it together in an Excel spreadsheet. This was a time-consuming process that typically only occurred once a month, creating a lot of lag time for people to get a snapshot of their performance and the status of projects. Additionally, the division had a huge internal demand for custom dashboards that they weren\u2019t able to meet using the multiple-application environment.\n\u201cWe had all these systems and no way of bringing them all together into one arena for analysis,\u201d said Jim Cray, Operations Director of Asset Management Services. \u201cWe needed a solution that was affordable and could connect to a wide variety of data sources.\u201d\nThe Solution\nAfter considering several solutions, including Qlik, H&J chose Logi Symphony to bring their data together in an efficient, user-friendly way. Mr. Cray explained, \u201cLogi Symphony was our preferred option. It was affordable, it met our needs, and the training was fantastic. We started to develop and create reports very, very quickly.\u201d\nTo address the demand for custom reports, H&J took time to truly understand its users\u2019 needs. The team met with each department and determined their key performance indicators (KPIs) and analytics needs, then created standardized reports and views. These dashboards are now available in real time via a web-based portal.\nAbout 100 internal support staff uses the portal daily to access reports on progress and financials and compare KPIs against internal and external service-level agreements (SLAs). Since the portal is both permissions- and role-based, H&J has also opened up reporting to its external clients, providing them with transparency into the company\u2019s performance. Next, they plan to make Logi Symphony the core reporting system for the 50 or 60 companies in their supply chain.\nAmong the data sources the Logi Symphony reporting portal pulls from is H&J\u2019s mobile working platform, an app the company developed five years ago to meet the business needs of its 145 field engineers. Previously, these users had to physically go to the home office to pick up or drop off orders. Now using the app, they can log a variety of data, including start and finish times, credit card expenses, and client signatures. With the advent of Logi Symphony, management can bring in that data to analyze the engineers\u2019 productivity.\nMr. Cray explained, \u201cWe can see all our data at the push of a button, whereas before we were having to take data from one source and another source and join it together \u2013 and we\u2019d only do that maybe at the end of the month. So, all that reporting is now at our fingertips.\u201d\nThrough standardized dashboards, H&J Martin can also measure its performance for contract KPIs, reactive response, planned/preventative maintenance, and more. \u201cWe can see how our engineers are performing, we can see how our supply chain is performing \u2013 who\u2019s falling behind and why,\u201d Mr. Cray added. \u201cThere are loads and loads of benefits and cost savings that we have gotten from the product.\u201d\nThe Global Services Dashboard, for example, shows the productivity of the company\u2019s internal engineers. The data, which Logi Symphony automatically imports from the mobile working platform, includes time spent on productivity, travel, training, holiday, sick, etc. Users can drill down by individual engineer or look at the percentage of overall productivity. H&J can then compare the engineers\u2019 overall performance against its target (in this case, the national average of 65 percent productive).\n\u201cIt\u2019s a first-class product,\u201d Mr. Cray said of the company\u2019s experience using Logi Symphony. \u201cIt evolves and is under continuous change when there are different demands on us to do different things with it.\nThe Results\nThanks to Logi Symphony\u2019s reporting capabilities, H&J Martin is now able to identify inefficiencies and take corrective action quickly. This both increases their productivity and avoids the costly financial penalties of missing SLAs.\n"

Outsourcing the analytics development was intended to free up development resources internally. However, the team soon found themselves with an overwhelming backlog of customer requests for improvements. It was taking the consulting firm weeks to fix critical issues. The team also had to be very strategic when making updates outside of new product releases as it was extremely costly.\nDavid Litzau, Director of IT for MGMA, knew they would need to find a more financially sustainable solution, which would allow the team to innovate more quickly. Litzau found a strategic partner in insightsoftware.\nSeven-Year Partnership with Logi Symphony: 12x Growth in Revenue\nUsing Logi Symphony\u2019s elemental design, MGMA was able to rapidly develop and deploy DataDive. MGMA now releases annual updates to DataDive two months earlier than their outsourced solution. This shorter development time allows MGMA to deliver the latest product features more quickly to market.\nThe partnership has been a success. Seven years later, DataDive is now the most profitable data product and accounts for 76 percent of the total data product revenue. Not only did DataDive drive revenue, but it also provided MGMA with additional opportunities to scale. To help with the initiative, MGMA brought on Miranda Bender, MGMA\u2019s Senior Manager of Business Intelligence, to manage the DataDive product team.\nThe Business Impact MGMA Didn\u2019t Expect\n\u201cLogi Symphony has enabled us to change the entire licensing and use structure of DataDive,\u201d Bender said. \u201cCustomers can now purchase multi-user licenses versus a single-user structure.\u201d As a result, MGMA reaches a wider customer base more cost-effectively than when they built their analytics in-house.\nLogi Symphony has allowed the development team to rapidly incorporate ad-hoc customer requests and add features throughout the year. Requests that once took weeks to deploy now take just days. Not only does this agile approach keep existing customers happy, but more engineering resources have also been reallocated to developing core IP ensuring DataDive remains a leader in the market.\n"

They have established a reputation for injecting service intelligence into every customer interaction, to simplify customer interactions across all channels. KANA\u2019s unique solution has enabled its customers to become renowned for exceptional customer service, in turn helping KANA\u2019s clients \u201ccreate customers for life.\u201d\nOverview\nChallenges\n\nTransitioning quickly and easily from a legacy reporting tool\nProviding agile ad hoc reporting functionality to end users from diverse industries\nDelivering faster, easier setup and implementation\nProviding a more user-friendly reporting format\n\nSolution\n\nKANA Software is using Logi Symphony to help customer service professionals create in-depth, on-demand customer profile reports that enhance the customer service experience.\n\nBenefits\n\nProvides unmatched report scheduling flexibility\nExpanded service offering and product quality for end users\nRepurposed more than 100 existing report templates into dynamic on-demand reports\nEmpowered agents with self-service tools to easily design, create, and deploy custom reports\n\nEmpowering World-Class Customer Service\nCustomers want to feel wanted. In an age of fleeting customer loyalty, the surest path to business success is connecting with customers and engaging them at a personal level. Based in Silicon Valley before being acquired by Verint Systems, KANA Software is giving global companies the tools and systems they need to get to know their customers better and provide an exceptional experience that creates customers for life.\nKANA is a leading provider of customer service solutions for email, call center, and Web. More than 600 companies and nearly half of the world\u2019s largest 100 companies use KANA solutions to provide customer support teams with real-time guidance and advice for end-user interactions, helping to improve agent productivity by as much as 75%, increase customer satisfaction, and differentiate their brands based on the quality of service.\nHowever, empowering customer service agents to deliver a highly personalized customer experience requires easy access to curated customer profile data. To enhance the quality and depth of the information they provide to customers, Verint\u2019s SVP of Worldwide R&D and Support, Vikas Nehru, set out to replace the company\u2019s existing reporting tools with a more robust, efficient, embedded platform to infuse more intelligence and dynamic data visualization.\nSophisticated Customer Service Demands Intelligent Analytics\nKANA Software has built its business on the strength of its customer engagement optimization prowess. The firm\u2019s comprehensive suite of products helps companies in virtually every industry provide their customer service agents with the information they need\u2014account history, previous purchases, and contextual information about customers\u2014to build rapport and trust with end users from a unified, intuitive user interface.\nSupplying the information to support such complex and time-sensitive transactions is a tall task. The company\u2019s previous reporting tool was ill-equipped to meet heavy data usage and lacked the flexibility its customers\u2019 businesses demanded.\nIn the past, reporting setup and creation was a disjointed and cumbersome process. KANA customers were limited in the number and types of reports they could make accessible to their support agents because defining report parameters, data sources, and outputs were time-consuming and inefficient. As a result, agents often lacked the complete 360-degree customer view they needed to fully engage with people calling the contact center.\nIn addition to difficult report creation, the previous reporting tool was a Windows-based system, which created interoperability issues for several of the company\u2019s enterprise-class customers. Trying to deploy critical and advanced reporting from within KANA\u2019s products frequently led to development delays caused by incompatibility and workflow inefficiency.\nNehru was eager to enhance the overall experience of KANA\u2019s customers and provide them with the most seamless and powerful customer intelligence solution available. To bridge the significant gaps in the company\u2019s reporting operations, he and his team wanted a reporting solution that simplified data collection from multiple sources, enabled on-demand creation of new reports, and made data easier to analyze and more intuitive for customer service agents, no matter the industry or environment.\nUnprecedented Variety, Flexibility, And Transparency\nKANA looked at many different options for a business intelligence and reporting solution and chose Logi Symphony for its simple setup and integration with its existing technologies. With Logi Symphony, KANA customers can supply their customer service agents with a complete suite of powerful tools to generate comprehensive, on-demand profiles of their customers.\nAlthough KANA had a library of existing reports from its previous reporting system, most were unusable in daily customer-facing activities and needed to be repurposed. Working with their support staff, KANA leveraged Logi Symphony to redesign and deploy more than 100 reports for daily use by end users.\nIn addition, the solution supports CSS styles, meaning CSS style sheets can be applied at runtime to apply custom layouts and designs on the fly, further accelerating the transition from old reporting styles to new ones. Logi Symphony\u2019s Designer offers a feature-rich interface that enables report managers to select multiple data sources, query parameters, and design layouts to develop sophisticated reports with just a few clicks.\nMeanwhile, Logi Symphony\u2019s drag-and-drop design interface helps users configure and display tables, charts, maps, and other visualizations that make understanding information simpler while supporting faster, smarter decision-making. Logi Symphony offers KANA and its customers\u2019 unprecedented variety and flexibility in data visualization options.\nMore importantly, the reports and dashboards can be easily embedded into virtually any backend system or front-end application, giving KANA\u2019s customers a consistent branded user experience with exceptional functionality. Logi Symphony is Java-based and platform-agnostic, helping to bridge technology gaps and alleviate interoperability concerns. Now, end users\u2014particularly new hires or transitioning employees\u2014can get up to speed and build their reports with little training or guidance.\nWalking The Customer Service Walk\nWith Logi Symphony\u2019s self-service features, managers and customer service agents can access complete authorized customer intelligence and generate reports with the most up-to-date customer information, exactly when they need it. The ad hoc reporting capabilities make it easier for customer service agents to personalize every interaction with every customer, delivering a superior experience that strengthens both KANA\u2019s and its customers\u2019 brands.\nOf course, much of this solution overhaul would have been difficult without some assistance. One of the biggest advantages of working with insightsoftware is the responsiveness of its knowledgeable support team. \u201cLogi Symphony stands out among its competitors for many reasons, the biggest of which is the high level of service they deliver,\u201d Nehru says. \u201cThe service from start to finish has been outstanding and continues to reassure us that we made a smart decision.\u201d\nGiven the overwhelmingly positive experience with insightsoftware\u2019s support team, KANA decided to expand the scope of its initial rollout. Instead of simply serving as a pilot project for one of KANA\u2019s products, the company decided to standardize the reporting platform across its entire product suite, delivering a reliable and scalable reporting framework to its entire customer base. \u201cLogi Symphony gives our users\u2014internal and external\u2014the ability to construct reports on the fly without having to be database experts or having to involve IT in the process,\u201d Nehru says. \u201cThat simplicity and self-service goes a long way in enriching customer relationships and driving better experiences for their end users.\u201d\nNehru says that the combination of insightsoftware\u2019s software and service will help keep KANA at the forefront of the customer experience industry. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with a lot of vendors and I can truly say that Logi Symphony is head and shoulders above every other vendor,\u201d Nehru says. \u201cLooking ahead, the smartest move is to continue raising the expectations of ourselves and our partners. I have no doubt Logi Symphony is up to the challenge.\u201d\n"

Organizations around the world rely on Informatica to realize their information potential and drive top business imperatives. More than 5,800 enterprises depend on Informatica to fully leverage their information assets residing on-premises, in the Cloud, and on the internet, including social networks.\nwww.informatica.com\nOVERVIEW\nChallenges\n\nProviding customers with the ability to report on archived data from any database\nSourcing and embedding a third-party reporting application into existing applications\nDelivering self-service reporting to customers at every level of an enterprise\n\nSolution\n\nInformatica uses Logi Symphony to provide customers with self-service reporting from within the Data Archive product and to create pre-built report packages that can be sold separately to accelerate user adoption and drive additional revenue\n\nBenefits\n\nEnabled customers in all industries to report on archived data, regardless of database\nProvided end users with an intuitive self-service reporting tool for faster time-to-value of archived data\nIncreased report generation adoption by as much as 80%\nDeveloped an entry-level reporting product that created new revenue streams and up-selling opportunities\n\nARCHIVED DATA STILL MATTERS\nWhen it comes to extracting maximum value from their enterprise data, smart companies turn to Informatica. The software company\u2019s comprehensive suite of solutions has been supporting the data integration, governance, and nextgen analytics needs of global customers for more than two decades.\nDuring that time, the company also introduced Data Archive, a transitional repository for moving inactive data from production databases and enterprise applications to another database, data warehouse, or to a secure, highly compressed, immutable file. While the software improves the performance of production databases and helps companies maintain compliance, customers still need the information readily accessible for reporting activities.\n\u201cNon-production data is still essential to our customers\u2019 daily operations and they needed a way to remain consistent with their reporting even after changing databases,\u201d says Mukesh Marodia, Informatica\u2019s Principal Product Manager. \u201cWe wanted to provide an intuitive tool that enabled customers to bring archived data to life.\u201d\nEmpowering Users with Streamlined Reporting\nFiguring out how to provide reporting capabilities on archived data was just one of the primary challenges Marodia\u2019s team faced. The other\u2014and more complex\u2014one was making data reporting accessible and intuitive for a diverse group of users. Informatica customers span virtually every industry, and each company\u2019s user base has its application for reporting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for our customers to have many unique user groups that need reporting capabilities on archived data,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking requests through traditional channels is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and not the most efficient way to meet the reporting demands of the business.\u201d\nWhile most of the companies have their legacy reporting tools, Marodia notes that report generation often requires assistance from a dedicated report department. Relying on one resource or department to fulfill the reporting needs of every business user across an enterprise can create production bottlenecks, which can delay access to essential information for days\u2014even weeks\u2014and potentially stymie productivity and create unwanted inefficiencies.\nFor example, business users such as physicians in a healthcare company setting or a business analyst in HR rely on archived data for daily use in their roles. Going through a formal report request process means waiting for the results and limits their ability to make important decisions. At the same time, other users like report administrators, designers, and reporting managers may need more advanced functionality such as the ability to create ad hoc reports for different business units or customers.\n\u201cWe recognized an opportunity to build more value into our customer relationships by providing additional capabilities to help them get the most out of their data,\u201d Marodia says. \u201cWe wanted to empower users with an intuitive self-service reporting tool with the flexibility to enable any business user or employee to run the reports they needed on demand.\u201d\nIntegrated, Intuitive Report Building\nAfter an extensive evaluation process involving several vendors, Informatica chose to build out its new reporting features with Logi Symphony. Rather than building a new proprietary reporting solution from scratch, Informatica can use Logi Symphony\u2019s APIs to embed the reporting capabilities right into its existing environment.\nLogi Symphony is database agnostic, so any Informatica customer can leverage the wide-ranging reporting capabilities regardless of their preferred data storage solution. Unlike more complex reporting software, Logi Symphony offers intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, enabling any business user\u2014from daily business users to designated report designers\u2014to effortlessly create a visually compelling report with the touch of a button from within Informatica Data Archive.\nThe software also features a variety of pre-designed charts, tables, crosstabs, maps, filter components, and other options for users to rapidly create dynamic, interactive reports in a wide range of formats.

        "content": "\nAbout Franklin American Mortgage Company\nFranklin American Mortgage is recognized as one of the fastest-growing mortgage companies in the nation. The company is dedicated to providing opportunities for families and individuals to achieve the dream of homeownership.\nOverview \nChallenges\n\nCrystal Reports could not achieve complex formats and instilled many\nreporting silos.\nManually running and distributing reports was time-consuming.\nFAMC needed to centralize reporting and securely share assets and insights.\n\nSolution\n\nFAMC chose Logi Symphony for easy embedding, improved scheduling, and the ability to promote secure sharing and reuse.\nLogi Symphony integrated with FAMC\u2019s existing application, data, and stored procedures.\nLogi Symphony allowed FAMC to reproduce complex forms through advanced reporting layouts.\n\nBenefits Summary\n\nLogi Symphony\u2019s customizability enables FAMC to create precision reports and automate operations.\nSecure sharing of reports and custom data sets enables reusability.\nScheduling reports with Logi Symphony eliminated the need to manually run and distribute reports, saving 40 hours per week.\n\nLeveraging Existing Data\n+ Leveraging SQL Server & MySQL\n\nNew reports are now generated primarily from data stored in SQL Server with secondary sources in MySQL, PostgreSQL, and some imaging databases. FAMC continued to use its existing stored procedures.\nData Governance for Self-Service\nDifferent departments can now securely share custom data extracts and perform their sorts, pivots, and drill-downs\n\nCustomizable Solution\nDivisional Branding Requirements:\nThe three divisions of FAMC, correspondence, wholesale, and retail, each have distinct color and style branding. Logi Symphony enables them to create professional reports in exact accordance with their requirements.\nHigh-Value Reporting Features:\nAmong the various advanced features FAMC values in Logi Symphony, the ability to enable detailed data sections, banded sections, and create sub-reports are the highest priority.\nDifferent Reporting Styles\nCollaboration with Excel Users:\nFAMC\u2019s reporting styles run the gamut from highly defined precisions reports to collaborative reports for Excel users. Logi Symphony enables exporting to Excel for further ad hoc analytics.\nLogi Symphony is Critical to FAMC Operations:\nLogi Symphony is critical to operations as loan officers capture data from clients in real-time after which Logi Symphony extracts the data into forms that are submitted and imaged.\nWide Range of Reporting Styles:\nLogi Symphony helps FAMC with reports ranging from list reports such as loans within a specific loan-to-value or credit rating range, to complex loan applications, such as lengthy 10-03 forms.\nThe Challenge\nAgainst a backdrop of increasing need for efficiency, Franklin American Mortgage Company\u2019s (FAMC) business intelligence solution previously incurred significant development times, could not achieve required report formats, and stifled analytics sharing and reuse. They had relied on Crystal Reports, which instilled a model of various localized silos where users created their versions of commonly needed reporting and data assets.\nAfter countless hours spent trying to replicate the precise format and layouts of government-mandated compliance forms, the mortgage giant was burdened by their existing toolsets and left in a situation where many reporting outputs required manual intervention before they reached a \u201cready-to-submit\u201d state.\nManually running and distributing reports was also a time-consuming task that the company sought to automate. FAMC needed to centralize data and reporting, and efficiently share insights throughout their organization.\nEasy Transition to a Better Solution\nFAMC needed a reporting application with the ability to integrate with their core Java application, the standard for many of the company\u2019s homegrown systems. After considering the newer version of Crystal Reports, Franklin American Mortgage Company chose Logi Symphony for superior support of complex report formats, improved scheduling, and governed sharing through a centralized reporting center.\n\u201cThe ability to interact with Java allowed us to embed reports in our application, call from the application, and create a reporting center. We can also share assets so different reports have the same style and the data is presented in a similar structure,\u201d said Angela Fox, Manager of Data Development, Franklin American Mortgage Company. \u201cWhen I first started, I only had experience with Crystal Reports, and learning Logi Symphony was a very smooth transition. It\u2019s fairly easy to use overall.\u201d\nComplex Reports Made Simple\nWith Logi Symphony, Franklin American Mortgage Company replicated many customer forms mandated by different government agencies. They were also able to achieve the exact formatting of customer letters to adhere to strict guidelines put forth by FAMC\u2019s internal marketing department. \u201cWe are able to do all of that with Logi Symphony,\u201d said Angie Fox.\nSaving 40 Hours Every Week\nFranklin American Mortgage Company has approximately 1,500 reports in their \u201cReport Center\u201d, which users can run on their own, plus over 250 that are scheduled to run regularly. Scheduling is a key component of the new capabilities provided by Logi Symphony. Previously, users needed to run and distribute the reports manually. In addition to consuming employee time, this slowed down their server resources. Now, reports can be scheduled to run at night when server utilization is low, putting reports in users\u2019 email inboxes when they arrive in the morning. FAMC can also schedule reports with default parameters or allow users to run reports on demand with specified parameters.\n\u201cIt was very simple to set the schedules up and to add and remove users. Scheduling reports has saved us trouble and has reduced the time and effort, enabling our employees to focus on our customers who are trying to buy homes. Considering our multiple divisions, we\u2019ve probably saved the time of one employee per week just running and distributing reports. If every report that we now have scheduled were manual, it would take all day, every day to do it,\u201d stated Ms. Fox.\n"

The company\u2019s homegrown analytics solution for their emplifi VoC\u2014Voice of the Customer\u2014product showed signs of aging when it couldn\u2019t meet customer requirements for customization and self-service. The emplifi team knew it was time for a new approach.\u00a0\nSigns of an Outdated Analytics Solution \nThe homegrown analytics solution for emplifi VoC served the company well for several years. But they couldn\u2019t meet their customers\u2019 growing demands to interact with their data because of a lack of customization. The emplifi team saw signs their application could no longer serve their internal end users or their customers.\u00a0\n\nTheir customers wanted better access to their survey data.\nThe existing solution wasn\u2019t customizable to match the skill sets of their end users.\nCustomers could only see the reports that were provided to them.\nCustom ad hoc requests increased, tying up significant IT resources.\nThey couldn\u2019t compete with the updated analytics capabilities their competitors offered\n\nEmplifi\u2019s existing in-house solution had become difficult to maintain, customize, and scale while balancing the influx of custom report requests from their end users. They needed a modern approach to analytics and reporting that proved to be both user friendly and customizable.\nA User-Friendly, Customizable Approach \nJulien Baron, emplifi\u2019s Software Development Lead, stated, \u201cThe main reason we picked Logi Symphony is because it\u2019s user friendly and easily connects to the data. We can build our own dashboards and adapt the solution to each of our customers, which was something we really needed and insightsoftware could provide.\u201d\n\u201cNow we\u2019re able to provide our customers with an improved, more detailed reporting approach. They can build their own dashboards and visualizations, get better access to their data, and gain more detailed insights than they had before,\u201d he added. While Logi Symphony offers an out-of-the-box, plug-and-play experience, the emplifi team chose to customize its self-service capabilities for their customers. \u201cThe goal of bringing in Logi Symphony was to customize it for our data analysts to focus on the deeper, more technical demands they have for their data. But we can also customize it for our customers according to their own needs for data and reporting,\u201d said Baron.\nThe emplifi team can also easily maintain their applications\u2019 analytics while efficiently scaling to support the growth of their users.\nA Modern Solution With Secure Integration \nMoving from an in-house analytics application to an embedded analytics solution has made a big difference for the emplifi team. Overall, they\u2019ve achieved the following advantages:\n\nImproved the CX platform experience\nReduced IT overhead\nModernized their analytics capabilities\nEmbedded analytics in application workflows\nKept their solution competitive in the market\n\nBaron said, \u201cReplacing our outdated legacy analytics system with Logi Symphony was a huge technical leap for us. Modernizing our application with Logi Symphony was like going from a 1990s configuration to a 2021 solution.\u201d\n\u201cLogi Symphony integrated easily and seamlessly into our existing environment and security framework, hiding the complexity of our own business and emplifi VoC from our customers. They can just focus on using their analytics to create dashboards and visuals in a dynamic way,\u201d added Baron.\nNathan Webb, Product Owner, VoC, at emplifi, stated, \u201cThe Logi team helped us redesign our data sources using a modern approach to easily and efficiently leverage their analytics capabilities. That work was a win-win because both our user teams and our application team leverage it.\u201d\nBaron\u2019s team set up their own testing environment and engaged the experience of the Embedded Analytics team along the way. He said, \u201cWe have strong business rules that we wanted to include, so we went deeper into the integration. The Logi team helped us apply our own logic with their solution.\u201d Webb shared, \u201c[The Logi team] has also been very responsive and helpful in connecting us to the resources and people we need to guide us.\u201d\nA Real Value for Their Customers \n\u201cEmplifi VoC collects all kinds of survey and customer data on feedback about a particular brand. By adding Logi Symphony, we\u2019re giving our end users an intuitive way to create reports and view all of their survey data, especially for key performance indicators (KPIs) and net promoter scores (NPS),\u201d Webb explained.\nWith Logi Symphony, emplifi has unlocked more value from their data. Because of the data that emplifi VoC customers collect, the company has made the new analytics capabilities available to all customers at no additional charge. They find it\u2019s worth it for the initial positive reviews they\u2019ve had from their customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen two major themes from our customers\u2019 feedback. First, they really like the new analytics capabilities and want to use more of them. Second, they get a customized template for their KPIs or NPS with the option to expand the filters for their VoC use case,\u201d Webb added. And, within just the first month of releasing the new analytics capabilities, their application adoption rate increased 25 percent.\nEmplifi prides itself in its average monthly user retention rate of 90 percent for their VoC product. During that same time, the team saw an increase in the average user retention rate of 5 percent, bringing the overall application retention rate to 95 percent. Webb stated, \u201cThat increase is good, though it\u2019s just a fraction of our total users so far.\u201d\nWhile still in the early stages of rolling out Logi Symphony, the emplifi team sees these preliminary results as a leap in the right direction for meeting their customers\u2019 analytics needs, now and into the future.\nAbout emplifi \nEmplifi is the leading unified CX platform that brings marketing, care and commerce together to help businesses close the customer experience gap. More than 7,000 brands, such as Delta Air Lines, Ford Motor Company, and McDonalds, rely on emplifi to provide their customers with outstanding experiences at every touchpoint.

        "content": "\nTaylorMade switched to Oracle EBS to boost its data capabilities and discovered that: \n\nAngles gave users a consistent data experience through the integration\nChange management was minimal and users experienced quick time to value\nAngles allowed TaylorMade to capitalize on custom golf club boom during the pandemic\nSales could see supply chain threats and manage customer expectations, boosting loyalty\nAngles analytics aligns data for optimized data warehouse reporting\n\nHeadquartered in Carlsbad, California, TaylorMade Golf Company is a leading manufacturer of high-performance golf equipment, golf balls and accessories. Founded in 1979, TaylorMade has a history of innovative industry-leading products. A major supplier for professionals and hobbyists alike, TaylorMade has established a legacy of breaking from tradition to reach new thresholds of performance and its technological advancements touch all sectors of the sport.\n\nThe Challenge: Pairing a New ERP With a Reporting Tool That Meets Future Demands\nOne of the first tasks for David Damitz, BI Architect at TaylorMade, was to migrate its systems from a weathered ERP to Oracle EBS. The challenges he saw with crossing over to EBS from the native ERP were:\n\nFamiliarizing users with new data-gathering methods emerging from interactions with customers.\nEffectively adding that new data to a data warehouse so that its benefits could be maximized.\nAligning ever-changing data to provide more real-time results and analytics to stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAs these new products or programs or projects get launched, we need to understand how to support the analytics piece of it, and how to be able to provide feedback and KPIs to the business on how these new products are selling, or how these new programs are running,\u201d said Damitz. \u201cSo, part of the challenge for my team is to figure out, \u2018Okay, is this generating data in new ways? How do we pull this data into our data warehouse? How are we able to provide more real time results to our business?\u2019\u201d\n\nIntroducing Angles for Oracle to the TaylorMade Team\nWhen his search for a new reporting tool began, Damitz kept in mind that TaylorMade had its own BI tools that were ingrained and accepted within the organization. He didn\u2019t want to have to roll out a new BI tool on top of a new ERP. His goal was to minimize the change management challenges, while balancing overall cost with the right product fit for the users he was servicing. Angles for Oracle hit the sweet spot, satisfying all of his criteria.\nDamitz saw that Angles would enable his team to:\n\nSave time and money establishing a data warehouse or data lake in the cloud with minimal data preparation.\nProvide real-time, self-service access to application data without IT assistance and time-consuming data preparation.\nQuickly modify or extend business views to fit their needs without typical delays.\n\n\u201cWe had already had some experience with the Noetix product (Angles was previously known as Noetix),\u201d said Damitz. \u201cThat was something we were familiar with, but I took the opportunity to look at other products and I noticed that, while other tools and products were available and had some interesting and compelling features, a lot of them were a little bit more proprietary. As far as the BI tool is concerned, that was one thing about the Noetix product that really appealed to us. As I did that analysis, it became clear that Views was something that would help us implement quickly and be able to provide reporting to the business right away. Otherwise, we\u2019d have to create custom reports and learn all of the tables and all the new modules that we weren\u2019t as familiar with.\u201d\n\nImplementing Angles Saved Valuable Time With Frustration-Free Processes\nGoing live with Oracle EBS was a big change for TaylorMade. Every department was impacted and users had to learn a new system with new processes. Angles was seamlessly rolled out around that same time, thanks to its ERP agnostic nature. Angles paired well with the new ERP and existing or native tools. Angles helped to reduce the learning curve for his users, allowing them to access data from multiple sources via one familiar interface. This meant everyone hit the ground running providing a swift time-to-value for these major technology integrations.\n\u201cImplementing the new version of Angles allowed us to quickly generate reporting metrics that would give our business access to this data, right from day one, and really reduce the risk of them not having the data they need to run their business as we went live with this new system,\u201d said Damitz.\nChampionship-Level Results With Angles \nAcing the Outcome with Angles for Oracle\nThe key wins for the organization with Angles have primarily been the speed and ease of the transition, as well as a comfortable price point. The affordability of Angles was a major plus for Damitz, allowing him to bypass the costs of a larger, more expensive reporting solution. There was no excessive change management processes or training to endure. In fact, the implementation was seamless for TaylorMade\u2019s users since they were able to use existing BI tools to help make the transition easier.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through a number of different business cycles over the years, a number of ups and downs in the economy, and ups and downs in our industry. Analytics becomes so important, as you\u2019re navigating those ebbs and flows, and Angles allows us to do different things to look at data in different ways to try to analyze how we reacted to things in the past that worked, and how we reacted that maybe didn\u2019t work as well, which helps us to avoid those pitfalls in the future. So, just to be able to have our users be able to come to us and ask for specific data that they haven\u2019t asked for before.\u201d\nUsing Real Time Data to Bypass Supply Chain Delays\nWhile the pandemic wreaked havoc on some markets and supply chains, TaylorMade custom golf clubs benefitted the lockdowns. In fact, Damitz says, the golfing industry itself pivoted from players clamoring for stock clubs at sporting goods stores to eyeing and buying fitted clubs from custom manufacturers. TaylorMade was, so to speak, tailor made for this trend.\n\u201cCustomers were getting fit for clubs that fit them specifically,\u201d said Damitz. \u201cHow it works is they go to fitting events where a fitter will tell them what\u2019s the best club for them, and what\u2019s the best shaft and what\u2019s the best grip. Then they can order that club, either through the fitter or online through our e-commerce platform. And they can get exactly what the fitter told them would be best for them.\u201d\nBut it wasn\u2019t a process without challenges. Sometimes a customer requested a specific club with a component that would be help up by supply chain delays. Facing lengthy lead times while working with these customers, Damitz\u2019s team was able to use Angles to provide real-time information about stock levels of various components. This meant their fitters and sales reps could see which orders were at risk of delays and determine what components were driving those long lead times.\n\u201cThey can see that there\u2019s a particular shaft that is backordered, and if the customer wants a particular shaft that has certain performance characteristics, it\u2019s possible that there are other shafts that give them almost exactly the same performance characteristics. So, if we swapped out that shaft with the other one, the lead time went from a couple of months to a couple of weeks, or maybe even a couple of days if we could get it right away. By providing that data to the custom team, they were able to go through their backlog of orders and really move a lot of those orders up and get those clubs into the hands of the customers a lot sooner, and obviously that\u2019s going to make for a lot happier customers.\u201d\nSeeing the Enhanced Value With Real-Time Data and Analytics\nA familiar user of Angles and its predecessor over the years, Damitz has seen the data landscape and analytics evolve. Business users want more real-time data, and they want it faster than ever. From purchasing receipts to accounting and GL transactions, getting real-time data in a hurry is a must. To this end, having the analytics component that Angles delivers is also a huge win for his team.\n\u201cThey do things like credit checks and holds where they need to analyze data on a more real-time basis. But when we\u2019re talking about how our products are selling, and how our customers are doing, and how we\u2019re doing on collections and things like that, those usually don\u2019t have much of a real-time need. That\u2019s where we use the analytics side of Angles, when we\u2019re able to do multiple loads throughout the day and pull that data out of EBS into our data warehouse. And that allows us to use a data warehouse that\u2019s been optimized for reporting purposes. That has given us really good performance, real consistency throughout the years.\u201d\nFor Damitz, the top benefits of Angles are the:\n\nSpeed and flexibility of data access for his team and stakeholders\nAnalytics that provide real-time insight into operations and enable true agility\nImprovements to the purchase and inventory management process, keeping costs down and customers happy\n\n\u201cAll those things help us be successful, and they help our customers be successful,\u201d said Damitz. \u201cThat is key to just have that data available in a way so that it is easy to understand, easy to get to, so that our users don\u2019t have to spend a lot of their time and effort generating analytics. They can use their time and effort doing the analysis on how these new kinds of unprecedented situations that are happening throughout the world, will impact us as an organization.\u201d\nA Brighter Future Is Inevitable With Angles \nBy removing manual data processes and boosting confidence in analysis, Angles has saved Damitz\u2019s team hours of repetitive work. His team can spend this time on other projects that provide value across the organization. Moving forwards, his team will look to take advantage of deeper Angles for Oracle features that will extend their operational analysis. It portends an even brighter data future for TaylorMade and its customers.\n\u201cAs we look to the future of our use of data, and in particular the use of Angles, we\u2019ve implemented a new cloud-based data warehouse that we are just starting to understand and see the benefits of,\u201d said Damitz. \u201cWe want to start to leverage that more and more in the analytics space. If another organization was considering Angles among other solutions for their reporting needs, particularly from Oracle EBS, I would definitely encourage them to look into the product.\u201d\nLearn more or even schedule a demo here, and see how Angles for Oracle can help transform your business today.\n"

        "content": "\n\nFounded in 2003, Alfatech is a Dutch electrical engineering and telecom business with a global customer base. Alfatech prides itself on high-quality work across many sectors: from retail to automotive and from banks to defense. Alfatech employs a people-centric, personal service and seeks to feel what technical needs exist in its clients\u2019 workspaces. It responds to this with concrete, pragmatic, and sustainable solutions.\nBas Verweij has been the CFO at Alfatech for the last 10 years. Verweij and his team are responsible for all the financial processes and reporting, working closely with Microsoft Business Central ERP data. But as the company has experienced consistent growth, its scope has expanded to support more management reports and dashboarding to improve data oversight.\n\u201cAlfatech has two main branches, building-related installations and telecom infrastructural projects,\u201d said Verweij. \u201cOn the install side, we work with clients like ABN AMRO, government defense, and the police force where we focus on visual projects for security systems, IP data and security. Our telecom work focuses on indoor and outdoor installations of telecom equipment for the three major national service providers.\u201d\nAll the Data, No Way to Use It \nThe telecom industry is characterized by the number of projects running concurrently, with a big variance in project scope. Alfatech has hundreds of projects on the go at any one time, each with its own stream of data. Verweij\u2019s team was flooded with data they didn\u2019t have the tools to process or analyze in an efficient way.\n\u201cCurrently, we have more than 1000 active projects we are managing,\u201d said Verweij. \u201cConsolidating this data in a meaningful way was a big challenge for us. Security and compliance were also a big focus for us. We had to carefully consider how we would guard all this data.\u201d\nAlfatech had successfully used Jet Reports for years, but as it grew, so did its revenue data needs. With so many projects in progress, Verweij was struggling to make the monthly figures in time and forecast Alfatech\u2019s revenue. Administrative delays and slow data extraction from multiple data sources meant that it might take weeks for Verweij to gather accurate data on the progress and forecast of all projects .\n\u201cWe would have projects sitting in our system with invoices out, that were still waiting for approval. We had no overall view to tell us the progress of these projects. That is just one example. If we had a question, there was no easy way to find the answer. We\u2019d have to go into Excel and extract the information manually to check the data quality and find the source of any discrepancies. That takes time and often we didn\u2019t end up doing it. We would settle with analyzing the processed items. We were always working behind our data, which is not a good look for any finance team.\u201d\nWithout a purpose-built analytics tool, Verweij\u2019s team were not able to use data around invoices out or unbooked amounts to get the depth of insight required to act quickly.\nThere was a real need for a set of standard analyses to allow project managers to monitor the progress of their projects. Previously, it was only possible to monitor the projects through a set of standardized lists. Now Verweij\u2019s team can merge and prepare the data in such a way that project managers can see top-down into their projects, offering strong overview of their projects and easy access to zoom in on the details.\nA Partner in Need\nVerweij consulted with implementation and BI partner Dynamics4Business to find a solution that would fit his needs. He needed a solution that could:\n\nGive his team control and consistency over all data streams\nOffer easy self-service of analysis, even for non-technical users\nReport across multiple data sources\nStore data in a pre-built data warehouse\nBoost the depth and accuracy of Power BI visualizations\nReduce his team\u2019s reliance on IT\n\nDynamics4Business (D4B) is a fast-growing Microsoft Gold Partner in the Netherlands, delivering software solutions based on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Hans Schepers, a Senior BC and BI Consultant at D4B with 17 years of Jet experience, was ready to help Alfatech find the data answers it sought. A hands-on partner, D4B takes a pragmatic and goal-focused approach to helping its clients. Its project methodology revolved around regular contact, equipping end-users with the knowledge for long-term success.\nGiven Alfatech\u2019s experience with Jet Reports, D4B suggested Jet Analytics, a solution that would allow staff to remain within a familiar Jet interface, while adding new functionality. D4B was confident in the suggestion as they had implemented it successfully with numerous other clients with similar data woes.\n\u201cI was quickly convinced that Jet Analytics was the right solution for us,\u201d said Verweij. \u201cD4B pulled together a proof of concept, showed us how it all worked, and I was sold. I enjoyed that I could see \u2018not yet booked\u2019 and \u2018not yet responsible\u2019 projects, alongside approved work. It also seemed like it would be an easy installation process and our team could get up and running quickly.\u201d\nRapid, Low-cost Implementation\nA plug-n-play solution, Jet Analytics was integrated quickly, combining data sources and boosting reporting efficiency for Verweij\u2019s team.\n\u201cImplementation of Jet Analytics was quick and efficient,\u201d said Verweij. \u201cWithin three weeks, our team could easily do the basics. Then we spent some time building custom tables and tailoring the system to our specific needs. Now we have a robust data warehousing system and real-time oversight of business actuals.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d go as far as to say that the process was even pleasant,\u201d said Verweij. \u201cSome of the technology is complicated for me. But I didn\u2019t have to worry with Dynamics4Business and insightsoftware in my corner. We\u2019d look at the whole structure together and they would help me build reports. Slowly I took over and now I feel completely in control.\u201d\nExponential Value: Jet Report plus Analytics\nComprehensive Vision of the Future\nThe number one advantage of Jet Analytics for Verweij was the ability to combine and streamline multiple data sources. With so much data flowing in from all over the business, Jet Analytics could ensure the data was clean and correctly formatted. His team saved two weeks off the monthly reporting process with accurate, current data from across the business.\n\u201cOn a high level, a big priority for my team is steering the business on costs,\u201d said Verweij. \u201cWith Jet Analytics, we don\u2019t have to wait for customers or IT to update our reporting, we have a clear vision of the future. Now we can generate the insights to help business leaders take early action, before the consequences escalate. The real advantage is that we can now create reports that we couldn\u2019t before. Combining and defining data offers insights and gives us the opportunity to respond much faster, almost in real time, to the current figures.\u201d\nUntainted Cash Flow Data\nWith hundreds of projects on the go at any one time, Verweij\u2019s team struggled with an inconsistent view of working capital. Reliant on customers and staff for data administration, the team was uncertain of the state of each project. This, combined with a manual ERP data extraction process, meant that cash flow reporting and forecasting suffered greatly and was only done once a month.\n\u201cMy team\u2019s reporting work would begin once a month when all projects had been checked and assessed. We would discuss portfolios with project managers and update our reporting accordingly. We would have incomplete bookings floating in our system that we could only investigate with very tedious manual processes.\u201d\nBefore Jet Analytics\u2019 data warehouse, Alfatechs data was clogged with uncertainties. Now, discrepancies are highlighted and dealt with quickly. Verweij\u2019s team can see which project managers or customers are causing data delays and have productive, informed conversations to rectify the problem.\nEasier Customization of Power BI has Boosted Staff Engagement\nUp to date, accurate data has also boosted staff engagement with Power BI. They start to see the value in more consistent performance insight. Jet Analytics is so simple that with just a bit of training, even non-technical staff can confidently perform their own analysis. Alfatech\u2019s business leaders love Power BI and get even more value from the visualizations now that they are connected to real-time data.\n\u201cIt took a while to get users excited, but I would just ask them questions about what they wanted to see more of,\u201d said Verweij. \u201cOnce I had identified their needs, I could solve their problems with Jet Analytics and Power BI. Slowly they started to realize the potential of this technology. Jet Analytics is so easy to use that now I have several users generating their own analysis. They can re-use the same reports for many purposes. You can make multiple cubes with different cross-sections from the same source of data. All without really having to do a lot of tinkering in Power BI.\u201d\n\u201cUp-to-date information, refreshed twice daily, is invaluable to our project leaders, who used to only get these insights once a month. They can immediately see what has been booked and what is still out. They can assess those differences and act on them with confidence.\u201d\nJet Analytics Supercharges Finance Tooling for Alfatech\nHaving spent many years successfully utilizing Jet Reports, it was an easy decision for Alfatech to add the capabilities of Jet Analytics to its toolbelt. Armed with accurate, streamlined data, Verweij\u2019s team can effortlessly report across the business\u2019s full portfolio of projects.\nJet Analytics is a complete data preparation, automation and modeling solution that is five times faster than hand coded solutions and can be managed in-house. It adapts quickly to changing business needs, to ensure you always have consistent, timely, accurate data that you can trust, making it easy to deploy your front-end visualization tool (Power BI, for example) or reporting tool of choice.\n"

        "content": "\nUsing Qlik Sense to simplify analytics for end users\nAdviseInc works with NHS Trusts\u2019 clinical procurement data \u2013 cleaning, customising, and standardising it to provide their clients with access to that data in the form of Qlik Sense dashboards (and QlikView, to a lesser extent).\n\u201cWe use QlikView and Qlik Sense for all our data processing,\u201d Ben shared. \u201cAll of our front-end data presentations are provided through QlikView and Qlik Sense.\u201d Ben Thomas, Head of Engineering, AdviseInc\nTo simplify the analytics journey for their end users, AdviseInc standardises the look and feel across their Qlik Sense apps with the help of Vizlib\u2019s customisation. Together with this design standardisation, AdviseInc also provides basic training on their dashboards, further boosting Qlik Sense adoption. They usually only have to train users on one app, as the familiar design and layout ensure the apps are intuitive to use.\nOne example is an inventory management app they\u2019re currently building. A Trust typically has tens of thousands of items on a shelf across dozens of locations, making it difficult to manage medical stock levels. With the help of Qlik and Vizlib, they\u2019ll be able to reduce stock waste, which will be \u201ca huge cost saving for them,\u201d Ben explained.\nInternally, AdviseInc uses Qlik Sense for all their dashboard usage- and internal system monitoring. \u201cSo we get to see who\u2019s using what aspects of our apps and use that to improve the development process,\u201d Ben continued.\nThe need to go beyond native Qlik Sense\nFor AdviseInc, however, the native functionality offered by Qlik Sense was not enough to meet their needs or their customers\u2019. \u201cWith just standard Qlik Sense, apps are immediately recognisable as Qlik apps. We wanted more customisation than what Qlik Sense provided to us out-of-the-box,\u201d Ben shared.\nIn addition to customisation limitations, AdviseInc missed the range of configuration options included originally with QlikView. \u201cIt would drive you a little crazy,\u201d Ben admitted, \u201cbut at least there were many configuration options available with QlikView.\u201d Switching primarily to Qlik Sense in recent years, they feel like they are \u201cnot able to achieve a pixel-perfect design by any stretch with Qlik Sense alone\u201d.\nMore design freedom with Qlik + Vizlib\nAdviseInc found the additional customisation capabilities they sought when they added Vizlib\u2019s value-added products to their Qlik Sense analytics. And have now been able to \u201creally make our apps look and feel how we wanted them to,\u201d Ben declared, \u201c\u2026like AdviseInc apps, effectively sort of white-labelled Vizlib.\u201d\n\nThey were able to easily white label (implement their own brand design) their Vizlib dataviz components, such as Vizlib Sheet Menu, included in Vizlib Library. Along with the extra branding freedom, Lee added that \u201cSheet Menu is brilliant when you need to customise and style all apps.\u201d\nAdviseInc also benefited from the customisation options available with Vizlib KPI Designer. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fantastic product,\u201d Lee shared. \u201cAnd containers as well, because Vizlib Container Grid gives us the option of doing what QlikView does in object layering. So showing or trying to hide an object behind each other, which Qlik Sense just doesn\u2019t allow. We use the Container Grid to display different depths of information.\u201d\n\nAnother component that improved the insight journey was Vizlib\u2019s writeback capability, part of the Vizlib Collaboration product. \u201cThere was a second company offering writeback at the time, but it just didn\u2019t match our products requirements. Not the same support, not the same backing that Vizlib offers, nor any additional product offerings,\u201d Lee stated. \u201cFor our users to not have to update our database and building front ends that allow them to go in and effectively change what they\u2019re seeing on the screen\u2026 it was amazing to get to that point.\u201d\n\nThe support Vizlib provides, as well as responsiveness, also stood out for AdviseInc. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been helpful and very reactive. You\u2019ve taken our suggestions on board and been very quick about turning around new versions,\u201d Ben stated.\nA final resource AdviseInc commented on was the Vizlib community. \u201cThat\u2019s the place that I go to get the latest releases, updates, bug fixes, patches, you know, anything. So all of those are the reasons why we work with Vizlib.\u201d Lee summarised.\nNext steps in AdviseInc\u2019s BI journey\nIn conclusion, Ben explained the direction AdviseInc would be taking in the future. \u201cSo we\u2019re moving into more conventional data warehousing solutions and analytics points of view.\u201d He added that \u201cWhat customers now want to see is more than historical data, which is typically what we utilise. They want us to start building in more intelligent algorithms for predicting future outcomes.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nOutcome Health is a not-for-profit organisation providing innovative GP, clinical and population-health data analytics solutions across Australia. They also offer mental health programmes to support at-risk individuals and are true data-for-good heroes.\nThese trailblazers bring vital information to where it\u2019s needed most, since data analytics and visualisation still require much development in Australia, Outcome Health is one of the leaders turning the situation around \u2013 with the power of visual analytics!\nWe caught up with Jason Ferriggi, the Chief Information Officer at Outcome Health, together with Director, Jamie Supple, and Senior BI Developer, Mick Browning, to hear more about how they use analytics to improve patient outcomes!\nExtracting insights from healthcare Big Data\nThe amount of data in the healthcare sector is phenomenal. And distilling it into bite-sized chunks for practitioners, clinicians, nurses and support staff is vital. This is where Outcome Health and data analytics come to the rescue.\nTraditional patient medical records can be pages and pages long and could take a general practitioner (GP) hours to sift through the information, even when digitised. \u201cWe\u2019ve used visualisations to bridge that gap,\u201d Jason reveals. \u201cSo what would take a person maybe an hour to scroll through, they can now see within a minute using a visualisation, because it jumps out!\u201d\nWith the right visualisations, the GP can immediately see what medical assistance a patient requires and book them in. So, it becomes \u201c\u2026a time-saving mechanism to deliver better patient outcomes,\u201d Jason explains.\nOutcome Health employed their visionary thinking to create a much-needed app \u2013 one that enabled GPs to get the insights for a patient at a glance. They believed the right analytics solution should provide all the context for a patient in 10 seconds! And they got it right, with a bit of help!\nVizlib\u2019s game-changing data exploration and navigation capabilities\nUsability is key when it comes to reports. \u201cThere\u2019s no point building a report if it doesn\u2019t get used or if it\u2019s hard to use. People will walk away from it. Reports must be easy to use, as end-users are not always the most technically savvy and often face major time constraints\u2014as many GPs do in busy clinics,\u201d Jason added.\nQlik was a considerable help in simplifying complex health data and making it more usable for their customers. Yet, the Outcome Health team felt Qlik Sense\u2019s native capabilities didn\u2019t offer them what they needed. And this is where Vizlib entered the picture!\nAdded customisation uncovers insights with Vizlib Library\nAccording to Jamie, they\u2019d been looking for ways to customise tables in Qlik Sense. And soon realised the solution lay in Viztips, the highly-customisable tooltip included in Vizlib Library. \u201c\u2026this is the future of displaying lots of complicated data at a patient-level!\u201d Jamie shared.\nJason added that \u201cViztips changed our life! It sounds simple, but you\u2019ve got so much information to display and being able to hover over it, see the detail, and it then disappears without taking up screen real estate, was a huge benefit.\u201d\nViztips enable their end-users to drill down into patient information, such as risk profile scores. Users can hover over the profile and uncover the Why behind a patient\u2019s score. Or review a list of patient diagnoses on hover, which would otherwise hog most of the dashboard!\n\u201cThe ability to add so much context on hover has been a huge game-changer for this report. We also use Viztips in other reports.\u201d Jason shared. \u201cThe report that displays risk profiles has been totally and utterly revolutionised by Vizlib.\u201d\nAnother benefit for Outcome Health\u2019s customers is the customisation in Vizlib Library. With customised colours in reports, GPs can spot when a patient last had a health assessment and determine their health care needs and eligibility quickly. It speeds up patient care so \u201cthe practice wins, the patient wins, and everyone is happy,\u201d Jason confirms.\nAdding extra context on hover with Viztips and greater customisability in Qlik Sense makes healthcare insights pop\n\nVizlib KPI Designer displays GP accreditation standards at a glance saving GPs valuable time\n\nVisual decision-making support with Vizlib Gantt\n\nTypical clinical information systems don\u2019t allow you to easily get the bigger picture on a patient. But, Vizlib Gantt provides the summary view and ability to drill-down that GPs need. It saves time they would otherwise spend flipping between numerous tabs.\nOutcome Health created the patient-on-a-page app with the help of Vizlib Gantt, as other BI solutions didn\u2019t provide the workability they needed. And their innovative app is now a vital decision support tool for their GPs.\n\u201cWhen we did usability testing with some practices, the first thing they wanted to do was bring up their really complex patients and they were just blown away at how quickly they could see the last year of detail for a particular patient,\u201d Jason concluded.\n"

First Quartile Consulting has been producing this highly-regarded report for a number of years, trialling a number of different approaches.\nPrior to the integration of Qlik Sense and Vizlib, First Quartile Consulting had, for 10 years, been using its own custom-built software, designed to support the creation of this report. They had reached a point where the benefits of having their own custom software was outweighed by the challenges of maintenance and upgrades to keep pace with client\u2019s demands.\nThey were looking for a solution that offered innovative and constantly evolving features that would allow them to increase the focus on improving its value-add services and insights, rather than time spent on the production of the report.\nThe team approached a third-party consultant to identify the best solution to solve their business challenges. Following a review of the leading data analytics providers, it was agreed that Qlik Sense was the best all-round solution and the only one that offered Nprinting, a key catalyst for the team\u2019s decision.\nRealising the benefits of data visualisation\nAfter a successful implementation in September 2019 and using Qlik Sense for the first version of the 2020 report, the team quickly identified a need for powerful data visualisation capabilities, in particular, colour formatting of the bars to indicate the company the data related to.\nWith 40+ companies benchmarked in the report and thousands of pages, being able to quickly and easily identify a company and the relevant data was becoming a business-critical issue, not only for First Quartile Consulting but also the clients that received the report.\nThe team reached out to the Qlik forums in search of an answer and discovered that Vizlib could help to solve their challenges. Following support from Qlik Sense and then subsequently Vizlib, the team were quickly up to speed and using Vizlib Library, improving the ease in identifying each company\u2019s dataset and reading the data.\nTransforming the production process with Qlik + Vizlib\nAs well as solving the issue of colour formatting the bars, the team have realised significant resource savings and improvements in the production process leading to additional time that can be spent on value-add services for its clients.\nAs part of its service offering, once the data was gathered, First Quartile Consulting reported back with a customised presentation for each company, drawing conclusions and analysis of the company-specific data.\nPrior to the implementation of Qlik Sense and Vizlib this was a manual process, whereby a dedicated resource would manually go through each template PowerPoint and pinpoint arrows on the company-specific data and highlight areas of data that was relevant to that client.\nUpon implementation of Vizlib, the need for this time-intensive resource was immediately eliminated. This not only freed up this team member to focus on drawing analysis and insight, which offers significantly more value-add to the clients, but it also wiped out 200-hours over a 3-month period. In addition to the time-saved, it radically changed the production process.\nNo longer did the team have to wait 5-weeks for the set of company presentations to be completed, it could now be done within 48 hours.\n\nFurther benefits realised by the team: Viewing the value above the Vizlib Bar Chart rather than the client relying on the axis to interpret the data. This possibility in stacked as well as standard bar charts created a significant improvement for the display of data in the report.\nFuture plans with Vizlib\nIn the near future the team are planning to use Vizlib\u2019s writeback capability to correct \u2018bad\u2019 data within a client\u2019s Excel report, and Vizlib Teamwork, a practical collaboration tool for their team to provide transparency and improve efficiency when working on shared files.\n\n\u201cThere are many times when compiling this report that I can see a company has supplied inaccurate data.\u201d Debi Cook comments, \u201cTo be able to correct this, put it back into their Excel file and send it back to them to use moving forward will be invaluable to us and our clients.\u201d\nCook continues, \u201cVizlib Collaboration will help us to move away from manually marking up PowerPoint files with the changes that need to be made. It will mean we can easily share and work on changes within the documents, improving the efficiency of the team and the accuracy of the information we present to our clients.\u201d\n\n"

But since that \u201cwasn\u2019t very expandable with features and tools,\u201d Thomas shared, the group decided to upgrade to Qlik Sense. \u201cWe went to Qlik Sense so we could make better applications and get better data insights.\u201d\nThough Tectum has been using Qlik Sense now in their Finance, Sales, and Logistics departments, they found that the upgrade didn\u2019t entirely solve all their use cases. \u201cWith Qlik Sense, we still had limitations in some fields.\u201d Particularly with a rapidly growing database, linking processes across their value chain, and data feeding in from across Europe.\nThey knew without a doubt they needed more from their data analytics solution when they discovered Vizlib\u2019s visual analytics power. And finally, their Business Intelligence could support the speed of their growth \u2013 with Vizlib added to their analytics mix!\nThe finance team was the first to benefit from adding Vizlib to their Qlik apps. Since the team needed to adjust financial data quickly, it wasn\u2019t viable for them to do it in a source table because it takes too long. And that led them to \u201clook for something that they can adjust real quick and see the impact in the decisions they make.\u201d\nThey needed functionality beyond native Qlik Sense that would enable them to input data directly.\nIn considering the most suitable service provider, their buying decision included Vizlib and one other analytics provider. Ultimately, Tectum chose Vizlib because of its unique ability to expand the visual functionality of Qlik Sense. \u201cWe made a comparison and went with Vizlib for the extensibility that can be used with visualizations.\u201d\nFrom spreadsheet chaos to a replicable model for all departments\nThe finance team was the testing ground for adding Vizlib\u2019s input and visual power to their Qlik analytics. And from there, other departments also started using Vizlib to get more from their data apps.\nThomas explained that the finance team has \u201ca really big application that includes between 18 and 24 Qlik applications \u2013 a budget calculator.\u201d And thanks to Vizlib, those complex processes are now handled smoothly.\nTheir journey with Qlik + Vizlib may have started with finance, but soon burgeoned to many other departments!\nHow Vizlib helped Tectum achieve their business intelligence goals\nRegarding which Vizlib products they\u2019re using, Thomas shared, \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s mostly Vizlib Collaboration. So the writeback capabilities, like Writeback Table and Input Form.\u201d\nAnd they\u2019re certainly making good use of the ability to input data on the fly with Vizlib\u2019s writeback features. \u201cThe Writeback Table is common in most of our applications. Also, the Input Form is really helpful for sales department lists, for example. After a client call, they can update the database immediately.\u201d\n\nThey also use the Input Form extensively in finance for their budget calculator. Thomas explained how it saves them time. \u201cThe finance manager selects a few companies in the Input Form that have to be filled in. They then fill in any notes in the text box. And if the info was submitted with a quote, it will automatically send an email to the users requesting they fill in their company information.\u201d\nThe business also finds that the Writeback Table features cover a broad number of use cases. \u201cIt\u2019s not just to fill in a line. You can add conditional formatting, calculate columns, and link fields across apps with the Associated Fields feature.\u201d\n\nAlong with Vizlib\u2019s collaboration tools, they also use Vizlib Library, enjoying the range of options with Vizlib Button, for instance. \u201cYou have many options you can choose. And it\u2019s not just to navigate to the other sheet or to open an older application. You can indicate an API. That was something we were looking for, so we\u2019re really glad that was available.\u201d Plus, they\u2019ve also \u201cimplemented API in some buttons to send data to other systems or to start up PowerShell scripts and our servers.\u201d\n\nTectum Group also uses the Sheet Menu in Vizlib Library to streamline how their teams navigate their Qlik dashboards.\n\nNext steps in their analytics journey\n\u201cI think the next step will be more about Predictive Analytics,\u201d Thomas concluded. And liked the fact that \u201cin your live visualizations, you can already enable predictive analytics.\u201d\nIn the true spirit of innovation, Tectum Group found the most favourable solution to their analytics needs with Vizlib, and replicated the success across their business \u2013 improving their operations and driving continual business growth.\n\n"

It serves a population of 320,000 in the Greater Manchester area and has a staff pool of 4,800 professionals.\n\u00a0\nHowever, with only 700 inpatient beds and only 500 of those allocated for unscheduled patient care, the Trust\u2019s performance hadn\u2019t always been optimal. WWL has often faced humongous operations challenges that impacted their KPIs and the quality of patient care they could provide. Meticulous planning simply wasn\u2019t cutting it. They needed something better.\n\u00a0\nIn 2009, WWL purchased the software solution, QlikView. And though the software\u2019s uptake had been somewhat sluggish in the early implementation phase, it soon led to a major organizational change in the way WWL handled and analyzed data. The organization became recognized as a pioneer for adopting a data-driven approach in healthcare management. And their appetite for better data analytics continued to grow.\n\u00a0\nWe talk to Mark Singleton, WWL\u2019s head of business intelligence and acting associate director of IM&T, about their transition from QlikView to Qlik Sense and the role Vizlib played in helping the organization drive value from self-service analytics.\nThe bottleneck with QlikView\nSince adopting QlikView, the team developed 30 QlikView apps that supported the organization in different ways \u2014 having data from ward-level all the way to the boardroom has made the organization truly data-driven.\n\u00a0\nHowever, with more and more departments wanting to dip into the data pool with their own QlikView apps, the BI team fell into a major bottleneck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOur Qlik development depended on a team of three. We were spending more time developing apps than analysing data,\u201d remembers Mark Singleton. \u201cIn 2018, we started considering Qlik Sense in a hope to move our analysts from working in spreadsheets to analyzing information in Qlik Sense. And while researching the software online, we came across Vizlib. We felt Qlik Sense and Vizlib go hand-in-hand, with Vizlib complementing Qlik Sense really well. So we purchased both products,\u201d Singleton added.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nOn a mission to flip their BI structure on its head and make sure the team spends 80% of their time exploring data and only 20% of their time developing apps, the WWL Trust ventured into a brand-new self-service analytics world.\n\nMigrating to a new way of working was a learning path in itself and the team found Vizlib\u2019s products a critical driver in the wider adoption of Qlik Sense.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVizlib extends native Qlik Sense capabilities and provides greater flexibility, so you have more control over customisation and what the end-user sees,\u201d says Michael Rowe, Report Development Manager at WWL. \u201cWe enjoy working with Vizlib because it enables us to build faster and create dashboards that our end users love. There are a lot of advanced capabilities that come out-of-the-box, so we\u2019re able to create visualizations that better communicate key insights and lead to action faster.\u201d\nImproving insight sharing with Vizlib Collaboration\nWhen it comes to data-driven decision-making, alternative facts are simply not acceptable. One key factor that helped WWL instill a data-driven culture within their organisation is their commitment to achieving a single version of truth. Creating a single version of truth is about consolidating and aligning the reporting and analytics for the entire organisation. To get to that point, WWL ensured that all stakeholders within the organization \u2013 from clinical services to the executive board to their regulators and patients \u2013 got the same information from the same apps and reports.\n\u00a0\nThe launch of Vizlib Collaboration, a new trailblazing product built to streamline and simplify collaboration within Qlik Sense, has given WWL a new means of deriving more value from the data they\u2019ve already got in Qlik Sense. From data quality management to fueling insight and best practices sharing between doctors, Vizlib Collaboration empowered WWL to push their reporting efforts further and eliminate communication barriers between organisation\u2019s dashboard consumers.\n\nVizlib Collaboration\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cVizlib Collaboration is a fantastic product with a vast number of potential use cases, many of which are still on our implementation list,\u201d says Singleton.\n\u201cDriving meaningful conversations within Qlik Sense creates immense value \u2014 think of an A&E dashboard with the collaboration capability. It allows vital messages and alerts to flow instantly, leading to faster and more effective communication and, ultimately, better care for patients.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nFrom data to immediate action with visual analytics\nWWL NHS Foundation Trust has demonstrated the positive effect visual analytics can have on an organization. The Trust has succeeded in saving millions by improving efficiency while also improving the quality of care \u2013 all as a result of building and nurturing a data-driven culture.\n\u00a0\nWWL\u2019s executives and personnel rely on partners like Vizlib and Qlik to get quick, intuitive insights about their patients\u2019 journey through the hospital and treatment stages, which drive immediate action. And since equipping their employees with interactive, easily accessible dashboard displays, the Trust has been able to cut patient waiting times in its A&E department by 30 minutes. This has propelled WWL into the top 10 best-performing trusts in the country.\nThe most popular WWL Trust analytics apps\nThe Ward App: This app helps wards understand how they are performing and where they can improve.\n\u00a0\nThe Trust Board Report: Provides the organization with assurance on the level of care it provides to patients.\n\u00a0\nThe 18 Week App: This app helps WWL monitor and manage their performance against the national 18 Week target.\n\u00a0\nThe A&E App:\u00a0 This important app is often the barometer of the hospital\u2019s performance and is one of the most utilized apps within the organization. It predicts how many patients will come through the doors of A&E and enables the organization to optimize their staffing levels.\n\u00a0\nThe Operating Theatres App: Operating theaters are one of the organization\u2019s most expensive resources. The Theatre App shows how the operating theaters are being used, helping WWL identify any gaps in planning and highlighting areas where surgeon efficiency could be improved.\n"

        "content": "\n\nNovartis is a leading global healthcare company based in Switzerland. At Novartis, their drive is to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people\u2019s lives, and address society\u2019s challenging healthcare issues through innovation.\nWith over 100 000 employees scattered across the globe, Novartis relies on technology and analytics to continually improve efficiency, operational excellence and deliver more value.\nTo learn more about their passion for all things analytics and data visualisation, we spoke to Pierre-Louis Usselmann, the Visual Analytics Technology Strategy & Innovation Lead at Novartis.\nBalancing app customisation with performance\nAt Novartis, they don\u2019t do anything by half measures. When it comes to digital and data solutions, they\u2019re all in and know just the right place to start\u2014the users. Ensuring the users\u2019 needs are met is always their top priority. By following a human-centred approach to analytics, these digital champions achieve just that.\n\u201cWe have over 30 000 Qlik users,\u201d Pierre-Louis estimates, \u201cand the most important factor that\u2019s driving adoption is user experience,\u201d he continues.\nTo deliver user experience (UX) excellence, analytics solutions need to balance design, customisation and response time. When this state is achieved, it elevates the user experience to a new level, because, \u201cit\u2019s not reduced to UI, but rather focuses on the user journey,\u201d Pierre-Louis adds. With this leading approach, Novartis empowers their users to take actions that result in effective business decisions. And generate more value for not only their users, but society as a whole.\nImproving the user experience with Qlik + Vizlib \nEffective UX begins with good design and the ability to customise data visualisations to a specific audience. Hooking your audience or end-user with eye-catching design as well as intuitive operability is the first step in a successful user data journey.\nNovartis\u2019 extensive Qlik user base utilises both guided and self-service environments to produce more than 1500 applications per month. To ensure these users connect with and feel confident to explore their data, the organisation favours innovative solutions that go beyond native Qlik Sense capabilities.\nWith their growing focus on UI, their UX teams are dedicated to creating and customising dashboards to meet UX design standards. And one way they achieve this is by choosing solutions that add more visual power to Qlik Sense.\nOf the approximate 1500 apps created monthly, \u201cabout 60-70% contain Vizlib\u2019s value-added products,\u201d Pierre-Louis reckons. \u201cMore than 15 000 users are consuming an app containing a Vizlib solution.\u201d\nAdding design spark with Vizlib\u2019s value-added products for Qlik Sense\nTo add the necessary level of customisation and design for an organisation embarking on a digital revolution, their UX teams leverage Qlik + Vizlib. Pierre-Louis adds, \u201cWe show our UX teams all the visualisation capabilities that our delivery team is supporting by comparing native vs an extension from a Qlik vendor. And in most of the cases, we are comparing native with Vizlib.\u201d\nHe continues, \u201cThose guys have their methodology, tricky designs and prototyping. And today the only way to get close to what they propose for the business is by leveraging Vizlib\u2019s solutions.\u201d\nOutshining native capabilities with Vizlib KPI Designer \nVizlib KPI Designer adds more visual impact to KPIs. And, \u201cit\u2019s a really great way of presenting data,\u201d Pierre-Louis affirms.\nUsers can add visual layers such as charts, images or icons with Vizlib KPI Designer to create impactful KPIs.\n\nCreating reports independently with Vizlib Self-Service\nAt Novartis, they have approximately 1000 self-service business users working with Qlik Sense. And for Pierre-Louis and his team of 5, it\u2019s not possible to provide such a large cohort with all the training and support they might need. However, with Vizlib Self-Service, these users are able to create dashboards and reports from scratch in Qlik Sense without any technical support.\n"

        "company": "Novo Nordisk",
        "content": "\n\nNovo Nordisk is a leading pharmaceutical company based in Copenhagen \u2013 discovering, developing and delivering innovative medicines and delivery systems for those living with serious chronic disease.\n\u00a0\nThrough the support of user-friendly data analytics solutions, such as Qlik Sense, the organisation ensures optimum levels of innovation, commercial excellence and continual improvement.\n\u00a0\nTo hear more about how they deliver effective, fit-for-purpose analytics and drive user adoption, we spoke to Metti Mahdizadeh, a BI Business Analyst at Novo Nordisk.\nThe analytics tussle \u2013 moving from QlikView to Qlik Sense\nNovo Nordisk was initially working with QlikView, before migrating to Qlik Sense in 2017. But many of the users felt that with the switch, they lost much of the native capability. Qlik Sense didn\u2019t provide them with all the functionality and customisation they needed as a business.\n\u00a0\nAnd though Metti was promoting the use of Qlik Sense \u2013 it wasn\u2019t an easy job, initially! Without the additional features included in QlikView, the team didn\u2019t feel their analytics needs were being met. \u201cIf you work with QlikView, it is quite feature-rich, but it\u2019s also complicated. The first versions of Qlik Sense felt like they preceded QlikView. It missed a lot of vital, basic features,\u201d Metti shared.\n\u00a0\nAccording to Metti, even the latest versions of Qlik Sense did not deliver exactly what the users sought. The finance team, for instance, wanted to include specific fonts, colours and other high levels of detail. And that\u2019s when he realised there were enhancements for Qlik Sense that could fulfil their requirements.\nUsing Qlik + Vizlib to boost user adoption\nAt Novo Nordisk, they use Qlik Sense for international operations, sales and finance predominantly. But these teams required something beyond native Qlik Sense capabilities.\n\u00a0\nThe turning point for the finance team was when they realised that with Qlik Sense + Vizlib, they could get the customisation they wanted!\u00a0 They were initially using very detailed Excel templates, but when the BI team managed to replicate those exact specs with Vizlib Table, the finance team were on board!\n\u00a0\nThey also wanted more automation of their financial processes. \u201cAnd this only works if they can get the same thing they\u2019re used to seeing. Like the layout\u2014having the exact same view they\u2019re used to. It becomes quite handy with Vizlib!\u201d Metti added.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd this is where the journey started because once the finance people started using it more and more, the other teams became interested in using Qlik Sense and Vizlib,\u201d Metti continued.\u00a0 \u201c\u2026because you could create more layouts and modification, and make the visualisation or report more attractive.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd, as Metti reiterated, presentation is everything, especially since the decision-makers in any organisation are not necessarily highly technical people. The more dataviz wow they see, the easier the decision!\n\u00a0\nAs the momentum of business-user adoption grew, it wasn\u2019t long before the highly skilled users\u2014the analysts, were also on board with Qlik Sense and the Qlik community in the company grew rapidly.\nCatering to more use cases with Vizlib \nWhen you\u2019re promoting BI solutions, it\u2019s often to people that are using basic products. And they\u2019ve likely been using the same products, such as MS PowerPoint or Excel, for many years. Then you come along and suggest that, \u201cnow you can use other tools that are smarter,\u201d Metti adds, \u201cBut often they need some feature they used to have.\u201d And that\u2019s where Metti was proactive and realised: \u201cIf we include Vizlib\u2019s products, it will help us to expand.\u201d\n\u00a0\nVizlib\u2019s added customisation for Qlik Sense facilitates more line of business requests\u00a0\n\n\u201cBefore Vizlib, people asked for something and I had to say no. But now, when they come with unusual requests for the layout, for instance, I\u2019m sure I can achieve it with Vizlib. It gave me the confidence for these line of business requests.\u201d\nMore customization with Vizlib Library\n\nVizlib Filter\n\nSince the Novo Nordisk users wanted the same features they\u2019d had in QlikView, the native Qlik Sense functionality\u2014with only one filter option\u2014was not sufficient. But Vizlib Filter was able to re-introduce additional choices and customisation for these users.\n\u00a0\n\nVizlib Table\n\nAccording to Metti, his favourite Vizlib Library extension is Vizlib Table. \u201cEveryone wants tables. And I haven\u2019t seen any extension as customisable as Vizlib Table,\u201d he adds.\u00a0 As a result, Vizlib Table was key in driving Qlik Sense adoption in the organisation.\n\u00a0\n\nVizlib Line Chart\n\nTheir Finance team leverages Vizlib Line Chart for root cause analysis and forecasting. Metti shared an example. \u201cFor instance, with Covid, sales in China went down because they had to shut down some factories. And they wanted to do their budgeting to see how to assign the budget for the full year. So we could use the Vizlib Line Chart,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt looks much more visual than the native line chart. And we created scenarios so they could change their numbers and adjust the sales numbers \u2013 to see how they can predict and decide where their budget should land at the end of the year. And what the trend would look like.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith Vizlib Line Chart\u2019s advanced analytics capability, the team is able to plan more accurately during uncertain times\n\nGetting the data \u2018under the hood\u2019 with Vizlib Self-Service\nCustom Report in Vizlib Self-Service became a helpful tool for exploring the data behind the visualizations. \u201cRather than creating a table with buttons that show which dimensions and measures are visible,\u201d Metti added, \u201cCustom Report made it much easier to build a default data set and tell people, if you want to load the data or export it for further analysis that\u2019s not on the dashboard \u2013 use Custom Report.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\n\nFinally shelving Excel for a more modern analytics solution\nFor Phoenix LV, their analytics journey began many years ago with the business using Excel to create basic tables and visualisations. \u201cFor something like test visualisations, we used MS Powerpoint online,\u201d Karel added.\nSo, we were definitely relieved when he added that \u201cwe are moving away from this type of dinosaur solution to visualising data in a modern way.\u201d\nLooking at their present-day business intelligence (BI), Karel shared that the business\u2019 core function is the transportation of medical materials and medicine, resulting in them using logistics data every day.\nAnother key use case for their analytics is in sales, analysing the sales margins of the products they deliver, for instance. Also to gauge the profitability of each product, and optimise transport routes between their headquarters and retail points.\nMore dynamic data with Qlik Sense\nFor the past three years, Phoenix LV has been using Qlik Sense for their data analytics.\nBut even though they\u2019ve been shifting to more modern BI, not all their end users were along for the ride yet with native Qlik Sense. \u201cThe end users have to get used to it [Qlik Sense] because they\u2019re more comfortable using Excel and Powerpoint,\u201d Karel explained.\nTheir main use of Qlik Sense is for their finance department for visualizing P&Ls, and P&L reports.\n\n\u201cBefore switching to Qlik Sense and Vizlib, all the P&Ls were delivered in Excel tables. So it took a long time and was not dynamic.\u201d Karel Lebr, Data Engineer, Phoenix LV\n\n\u00a0\n\nBoosing Qlik adoption with Vizlib\nSince the company needs to visualize their P&Ls in a dynamic environment, they now use Qlik and Vizlib to simplify their data.\n\n\u201cAnd when I tried to make these P&Ls with only Qlik Sense visualisations, it was awful.\u201d Karel Lebr, Data Engineer, Phoenix LV\n\nThe business discovered that with the limitations of native Qlik Sense, the end users couldn\u2019t utilise the exact colours they wanted for their P&L reports. \u201cAll the P&Ls and other reports required specific colours for everything like budgets, for instance.\u201d\nSo they had a problem to solve. \u201c\u2026and it had to be solved because the business really needed customisable colours and visualisations,\u201d Karel explained.\nWhat did they do next? They searched the market for enhancements to their Qlik Sense solution. \u201cAnd we found Vizlib Library.\u201d\n\nVizlib\u2019s user-friendly experience boosts data usage\nPhoenix LV needed their dataviz to be more modern and dynamic. And by adding Vizlib to their Qlik analytics, the end users benefited greatly!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s far easier to get used to working with it because it\u2019s much more end-user friendly.\u00a0 It\u2019s simpler to get into and answer your business questions.\u201d\u00a0 Karel Lebr, Data Engineer, Phoenix LV\n\nNow all their users are working confidently with data using Vizlib Library. \u201cAnd the reason why is simple. It\u2019s so much easier to use it as a developer. And has helped us open up lots of new possibilities with our standard Qlik Sense visualisations plus Vizlib. And Vizlib\u2019s basic charts are much more valuable than standard Qlik Sense.\u201d\nAnd Karel wasn\u2019t finished singing the praises of Vizlib Library.\n\n\u201cVizlib Library is an amazing product and enhancement. I\u2019m really enjoying the features like the Viztips \u2013 the little details that make our reports better and prettier, plus easier for the end user.\u201d Karel Lebr, Data Engineer, Phoenix LV\n\nAnother Vizlib Library extension they\u2019re enjoying is Vizlib Pivot Table. \u201cVizlib Pivot Table is awesome because it\u2019s something our end users are more familiar with. It\u2019s really similar to the Pivot table in Excel. So it was easier to learn, much easier than learning the standard Qlik Sense Pivot table.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nNext steps in growing their analytics\nPhoenix LV plan to continue using Qlik + Vizlib to support their end-user needs. Since being fairly new to Vizlib\u2019s value-adding products, Karel shares their ideas for how they\u2019ll be expanding usage. \u201cThe next steps for the organization are getting used to working with data in a dynamic environment with Qlik Sense, with a lot of help through Vizlib Library.\u201d\n\nWithin the Vizlib Library range, the company also plans to explore Vizlib Table. \u201cThe possibilities of the table are endless. We can improve those reports much more than they are now.\u201d Plus they plan to explore the benefits of Vizlib Scatter Chart soon.\n\u00a0\n\nAs for what\u2019s next in their Vizlib journey, Karel added, \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to using Vizlib Self-Service because I think it can be really useful in the future.\u201d\n\nAnother way they plan to grow and improve their analytics and Qlik adoption are by improving data literacy in the organisation. \u201cWe have to teach the end users how to read data and how to use it.\u201d Karel feels that their main hurdle when establishing new projects is that \u201cend users don\u2019t know what can be achieved and that we can deliver in-depth reports because they\u2019ve used to using tools like Excel and Powerpoint.\u201d\nWe can\u2019t wait to hear more about how Vizlib is helping Phoenix LV boost data literacy and help all their users get the most from their Qlik analytics.\n"

        "content": "\n\nThrough their specialism and expertise, Catalyst BI is committed to leveraging the latest technologies across Data Management, Data Analytics and Data Science, and continues to help accelerate business value and deliver a world class partnership\u00a0to their customers and future prospects.\nA great example of this is when Catalyst BI identified and recommended Vizlib as an ideal solution to meet the needs of the team at Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust. In this case study, we reflect on this ongoing collaboration and how it has impacted the team for the better.\nWhat did THIS NHS Trust need from a data visualization tool? \nCalderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust employs over 6,000 people operating across two large hospitals; Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and Calderdale Royal Hospital in Halifax, both of which are located in the UK.\nTogether, these hospitals provide a range of services, including: urgent and emergency care, medical, surgical, maternity, gynaecology, critical care, children\u2019s and young people\u2019s services, end of life care, and outpatient and diagnostic imaging services. With so much to be monitored, having quick access to insightful data is crucial to delivering the highest quality of service, to both patients and staff.\nA Qlik Sense user for many years, Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust use Qlik across their whole organisation \u2013\u00a0 from board level applications to crucial clinical applications. So, the team was keen to ensure that they maximise the capabilities of Qlik across their systems.\nPartnering with Vizlib\u2019s data visualization solution \nThis is what brought Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS trust, Catalyst BI, and Vizlib together. The team at Catalyst BI identified the value in Vizlib\u2019s innovative data visualization tools and Business Intelligence solutions, and knew that the product would improve both patient experience and accelerate value across the Trust.\nWe sat down with Oliver Hutchinson, Planned Care Operational Manager, Gawaine Carter, Head of Corporate Information, Calum MacIver, Critical Systems Manager \u2013 Corporate Information, and Robert Cox, Interface and Intelligence Lead \u2013 Corporate Information, to understand the impact Vizlib\u2019s solution added value, both for their team, and their patients.\nHow the Qlik Sense and Vizlib integration improved efficiency and patient care \nThe initial need for Vizlib came from the team\u2019s desire to improve the process of outpatient bookings. The previous process involved clerical teams having to switch between clinical systems and Excel to manage the complex flow of outpatient clinic bookings. The Trust recognised the time that could be saved by switching this process for a single application that would allow their clinical teams to make amendments and write back to the data at the source.\nThe team sought the help of their long time partner, Catalyst, who recommended Vizlib\u2019s Collaboration suite to solve this challenge. The team consequently delivered a consultancy project that resulted in significant financial and time savings for the Trust.\nNow fully implemented, Vizlib\u2019s Collaboration suite is used across the Trust in many complex applications. It\u2019s estimated the project saved the equivalent of two full time employees in efficiency savings, allowing the Trust to redeploy crucial resources elsewhere. Adopting Writeback has also made the bookings process much more efficient, as it only requires one person to manage the tool.\n\nThe speed of development has been a real plus side to us. We\u2019re able to capture data into our warehouse by using Vizlib. If we were to do it the other way to capture data in our clinical records, that would take us months of development, whereas by doing it ourselves, we have been able to do it in minutes. Also having an audit trail of \u2018who\u2019s doing what\u2019 has been a massive bonus.\n\u2013 Gawaine Carter\n\nHow data visualization enhanced staff care\nUsing Vizlib has also helped the Trust with organising and documenting internal processes, such as staff records. A great example of this came during the Covid-19 pandemic, when staff care was at the height of concern for all NHS Trusts. It became a priority that all staff be vaccinated quickly to protect them and their families.\nThe Trust had tried many ways to manage this process. They attempted to use each team member\u2019s payroll number, but this became too challenging to track. The team chose to use Qlik and Vizlib Collaboration to build a Vaccination management application. This application helped significantly expedite the process and crucially ensured the welfare of key workers.\nSumming up\nTo summarize the impact of Vizlib on the team so far, Gawaine said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had Writeback in the building for 12-18 months. The proof of concept was so successful that at pace, a number of other pieces of work have moved forward and brought benefits to the organization as a whole. We like the integration, we like that everything is in the same place. We wouldn\u2019t want to revert to the old way.\u201d\nReady to bring your business forward? Vizlib\u2019s suite of purpose-built solutions will help your organization to level-up business analytics and data visualization tools. Get started now to enhance the capabilities of data analytics with improved dash-boarding power! Vizlib is free for up to five users, and loved by 1,000s of brands around the world.\n"

        "content": "\n\n\nChoosing the right visualization tool\nDAC uses dashboards for internal analytics as well as externally for their clients. \u201cWe have to have dashboards that serve all of us,\u201d Kuhan Puvanesasingham (Business Intelligence Manager, DAC Group) explained.\nInternally, they create dashboards to help manage operations, including budget pacing and campaign optimizing. External reporting is all about providing their clients with regular campaign performance updates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always created reports with Qlik Sense. But we\u2019ve been hitting a wall with the level of user experience and that\u2019s where we turned to Vizlib to elevate our reporting,\u201d Kuhan shared.\n\nDashboarding and reporting are a fundamental part of the services DAC Group offer. Every engagement they have as an agency includes an aspect of reporting. And to be the best service provider in their industry, DAC must be able to generate first-rate reporting for their customers. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be spending client money, we have to report on it.\u201d.\nWhen it came to finding the perfect partner to level up their reporting, DAC made every effort to find the solution that best suited them, and their customers. Some of their clients and employees were originally using a free analytics product. But they found the performance poor as the software couldn\u2019t handle big data. It lacked all the \u2018under the hood mechanics\u2019 that Qlik has. And people were disappointed in the look and feel of the dashboards.\nWhat they needed was more visual power for their analytics. \u201cWe love that Qlik Sense offers what you need on the functional side, but it really couldn\u2019t compete with some of the alternatives.\u201d Then, they had their \u2018aha\u2019 moment\u2026 after seeing a Vizlib demo. \u201cThat\u2019s when we thought \u2013 let\u2019s explore how we can make Qlik Sense compete visually with the other platforms.\u201d\nAnd from then on, they\u2019ve been hooked on Vizlib. \u201cOnce we got a sense of what Vizlib was able to do, it just opened up our workflows.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nGetting more value from data with Qlik + Vizlib\n\u201cQlik Sense is the backbone of all of our visualization and email analytics,\u201d Kuhan highlighted. But with Qlik plus Vizlib\u2019s value-added products, the team can \u201ccreate visualizations and dashboards that help our internal team and our clients make better business decisions on how they spend media, how we optimize media, and how websites are performing.\u201d\nWith Vizlib\u2019s customisation options, they can now also offer dashboards that match a client\u2019s color scheme and design expectations. Plus, their clients are \u201creally pleased that it\u2019s a familiar interface for their stakeholders.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nBut the big one is a large US Insurance company, the DAC Group explains. \u201cWe built a Qlik Cloud app with thousands of weekly users connecting to one directory. A third of our company\u2019s functions were involved in this project.\u201d And since it was such an important client, they knew they had to produce stunning dashboards, as competition is tough. However, the DAC team was not satisfied with the visual quality of the report with Qlik\u2019s native functionality.\nAnd that\u2019s why they added Vizlib to their Qlik analytics. The combination of Qlik and Vizlib\u2019s customizability empowered their design team to create a compelling and professionally styled visual data story that met the client\u2019s business needs and beyond!\nAnother favorite for the DAC team is Vizlib Templates. With this capability, they now create professionally styled dashboards and can develop them much faster too. \u201cWhen we get new clients, we can produce quality dashboards really quickly, and everybody seems really happy.\u201d\n\nBeyond adding value to their Qlik analytics as a service provider, Vizlib is fast becoming a true partner for their whole business \u2013 supporting and boosting their core services. With Vizlib\u2019s visual capabilities, DAC has streamlined their sales process and now showcases (and even shows off) their dataviz capabilities. \u201cWhen we show screenshots and demos of our existing products, the sales process is a lot better.\u201d\n\nFor instance, they recently created a Qlik Cloud usage dashboard for one of their big clients. \u201cAnd the usage happens to be really healthy,\u201d Kuhan adds. So the combo of Qlik and Vizlib \u201chelps our sales and increases the usage of our work amongst our clients, which is always good for business retention!\u201d\nWith the right data visualization in the mix, DAC confirms:\n\n\u201cWe can create products that we\u2019re proud of. People use it more, and it helps us generate more business.\u201d Kuhan Puvanesasingham, Business Intelligence Manager, DAC Group\n\n\nVizlib extensions that move the needle\nVizlib Library is the main product the DAC Group uses. \u201cThat was how we started this relationship,\u201d Kuhan shared.\n\n\u201cAnd we haven\u2019t even used Library to its full potential yet. We\u2019ve revamped our standard dashboard offering. And even with that, there are already 10 visualizations that we now can\u2019t live without.\u201d Kuhan Puvanesasingham, Business Intelligence Manager, DAC Group\n\nAnother Library extension they love is the KPI Designer, a tool to create customized KPI Objects in Qlik Sense. (You can even add objects such as an image or a gauge as different layers). \u201cThat\u2019s a core one. It\u2019s the most powerful and flexible,\u201d Kuhan reiterated.\n\nVizlib support \u2013 when you need it most\nDAC also complimented Vizlib on the level of support they receive. \u201cWe\u2019re talking same-morning response. We\u2019ve had some of your technical people on the phone within an hour, which is unheard of with other companies.\u201d\nAnd we helped them solve or improve their Vizlib dashboards at critical times! \u201cYou\u2019ve helped us solve issues at the last minute before we present something to a client. Typical agency life where we\u2019re still fumbling around with something the night before it goes out.\u201d\nDAC Group\u2019s next steps with analytics\nOn what\u2019s next for DAC Group\u2019s analytics journey with Qlik + Vizlib, Kuhan responded: \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking into next is potentially integrating predictive analytics into Qlik.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPlus, the team is looking into broader use cases, such as customer analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a project for a client that involves creating customer segments. And we\u2019re confident that we can present polished-looking products to them with Vizlib.\u201d\n\u201cSo, yeah, we\u2019re just getting started, now that we know the potential of Vizlib. We have definitely not exhausted what Vizlib is capable of yet,\u201d Kuhan concluded.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "company": "CNHi",
        "content": "\n\n\nCNHi is a giant in the worldwide capital goods market. They design, produce and sell agricultural and construction equipment, commercial vehicles and powertrains for marine and industrial applications. This major player has over 64,000 employees, 66 manufacturing plants and 54 R&D centres in 180 countries.\n\u00a0\nNaturally, such a large enterprise works with a colossal volume of data. And, though their data users share a strong analytics culture, not all the users have the level of understanding necessary to work with and analyse data effectively. Since the organisation wanted to speed up the time it took from insights to action for\u00a0all\u00a0data users, they recognised the need to improve their data democratisation.\n\u00a0\nData democratisation is the process of making data accessible to all data users in a business. The goal of data democratisation is that anyone can use data at any time to speed up the decision-making process and unlock new insights and opportunities for the business.\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019re speaking to Alberto Giorgi, who leads the Qlik Center of Expertise \u2013 Global Analytics at CNH Industrial, about the impact of strategic BI solutions on self-service analytics and data literacy levels in their organization.\n\n\u201cUsers in CNHi have a very strong analytics culture. BI and analytics play a very important role,\u201d Giorgi begins.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd with this underlying culture of embracing analytics, fostering a growing curiosity for using data in the broader workforce seemed a natural progression for the business.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnfolding the data democratization process\nCNHi sought to encourage more employees to use data in their daily roles. Yet, as a forerunner, the users needed to understand the data and the analysis tools before they became confident data users. The business required additional focus on the democratisation of data and, to successfully achieve this goal, they co-developed a three-phase approach.\n\n\u00a0\nPhase 1, or the Contamination phase, of the roadmap commenced with fostering an analytics mindset among the workforce. This really kicked off in 2017, with the deployment of Qlik Sense BI solutions to a 20 member analyst team. In 2018, this analytical drive expanded to 450 data users.\nOnce this phase wrapped up, phase 2 entailed the establishment of a CoE central governance or the control phase. The team achieved this by developing the right enterprise structure to support data literacy and then instilling the governance necessary to manage it effectively.\n\u00a0\nAnd the final phase was all about the users, empowering them to use data confidently to create tailor-made visualizations.\nUsers get the customization to create compelling, branded dashboards\n\nVizlib dashboards\n\u00a0\nThe final data democratisation phase for CNHi, the humanisation step, was where the data and humans truly came together. The enterprise had to ensure everyone had access to data in a way that was understandable and matched their data literacy level.\n\u00a0\nDuring this time frame, big changes occurred. By 2019, the number of data users deriving business value from data had grown to over 1600, when Vizlib\u2019s value-added products for Qlik Sense were introduced to the business. And, by 2020, the number of people in the workforce empowered to use, think with and analyse data had boomed to 7500 users \u2013 a whopping increase of over 350% in one year!\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nSince different BI solutions offer different capabilities, the team had to ensure their data goals would be served. And, for CNHi, customisation was\u00a0the\u00a0essential factor for their analytics roadmap.\n\n\u201cWhat brought us to use Vizlib was the lack of visual objects in-bundle with Qlik Sense. Vizlib offered a very interesting set of additional value-added products, and capabilities within those products, that for our business users was a \u2018must-have\u2019,\u201d Giorgi affirms.\n\nVizlib supported CNHi by providing easy-to-use, appealing visualization capabilities for Qlik Sense that required no coding experience and enabled high levels of customization. The ability to customize every chart just the way they wanted it empowered users to develop compelling, branded dashboards.\n\u00a0\nA major component, which was a hit with the users, was the deployment of the Qlik Data Concierge \u2013 an advanced self-service solution based on the re-usability of data source specific structures and metadata.\n\u00a0\nThe data concierge helped data users quickly find what they were looking for through an easy-to-use catalogue. The catalogue, composed of two categories: Dimensions and Measures, enabled users to select the relevant data points to tell their customized data story. Consequently, these data citizens now had the capacity to build their Qlik Sense apps by choosing their data visualizations and getting the right insights on the fly. And the confidence to continue using data in their daily roles.\n\u00a0\nIn addition, CNHi received fully-supported service throughout their data democratization journey with Vizlib \u2013 both responsive and effective technical support.\n\u00a0\nCurrently, CNHi uses the Vizlib Library and Vizlib Self-Service offerings. And they have found Vizlib\u2019s Filter, Advanced Text Object, Table, Pivot Table, Container, Sheet Menu, BarChart and ComboChart particularly useful in improving their data analytics pipeline.\n\u00a0\n"

        "content": "\nSlow visual analytics adoption\nThe company has not traditionally put a lot of focus on visual analytics, as most employees are used to reading data in tables. Christian explained that their preference for table formats \u201coriginates from working within the QlikView environment,\u201d and seemed to naturally become the norm for how the company analyses data.\nBut as the business evolves, they are beginning to appreciate the benefits of a more visual approach to data analysis, powered by\u00a0 Vizlib\u2019s user-friendly products for supercharging their Qlik Sense. With Vizlib + Qlik, they\u2019re experiencing first-hand how visual analytics can simplify data for their end users. For instance, Christian added, \u201c[w]e are now implementing visual charts for management,\u201d which ensures that the business gets the right insights at the right time.\nUsing Qlik Sense to improve manufacturing outcomes\nThe business uses Qlik Sense primarily to manage and streamline manufacturing processes in their production control department. Christian elaborated that they need to get the data into a particular structure in their manufacturing environment before they can use it in further processes. Once the format is right, they export the data to other business solutions that ultimately ensure maximum process efficiency.\n\n\u201cI recently had an export requirement that relied on a specific format, and I know we couldn\u2019t have done it with normal Qlik Sense. It was easy with Vizlib Pivot Table. And for me, as a developer, that\u2019s a big factor.\u201d\u00a0 Christian Kuhn, Team Lead Regulatory Affairs International, Hermes Arzneimittel Holding GmbH\n\nSales is another key department at Hermes Arzneimittel that benefits from Qlik. A common use case there is for analysing turnover. And across the organisation, the business is using Qlik Sense to extract value from their data, especially using big tables. For them, \u201chaving everything in one place,\u201d is incredibly helpful.\nYet, Christian shared that there were \u201csome business requirements we simply couldn\u2019t achieve,\u201d through their native Qlik solution. However:\n\n\u201cWith Vizlib, we can do everything we want.\u201d Christian Kuhn, Team Lead Regulatory Affairs International, Hermes Arzneimittel Holding GmbH\n\n\u00a0\n\nVizlib\u2019s user experience boosts Qlik adoption\nAt Hermes Arzneimittel, the product team was not satisfied with the limitations of Qlik\u2019s native capabilities. So, to boost their Qlik Sense adoption, the business started using Vizlib\u2019s value-adding products. And their analytics \u201cchanged entirely when I discovered Vizlib,\u201d Christian stated. And now, their users are more enthusiastic about using Qlik.\nAnother key benefit of adding Vizlib was that the team could smoothly migrate their analytics from QlikView to Qlik Sense. And even though users get used to working with a particular platform, the change was not tough with Vizlib, Christian explained. \u201cVizlib has helped us a lot in getting people to use the tool [Qlik Sense] more.\u201d\nIn fact, Christian shared that as a business, they don\u2019t use Qlik Sense without Vizlib.\n\nWhen it comes to specific Vizlib products and extensions, the discussion fell on Vizlib Library. The data team appreciates the ease of use when exporting from Vizlib Pivot Table (part of the Library product), for instance, to streamline their processes.\nAnother Vizlib Library extension they leverage is Container Grid. This was something they found lacking with native Qlik Sense, Christian explains.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using the Container Grid a lot. I really like it because it offers so much information in one place without switching a lot.\u201d Christian Kuhn, Team Lead Regulatory Affairs International, Hermes Arzneimittel Holding GmbH\n\n\nAlso, \u201cVizlib Sheet Menu enables us to customise the design with our company colors without having to do advanced web development. It was something we couldn\u2019t do otherwise as we didn\u2019t have the time for it. It\u2019s really a time-saving object for us.\u201d Christian explains.\n\u00a0\n\nA self-service approach for the future\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith their business intelligence, they\u2019ll be looking into more Self-service analytics next, and foresee this bringing the business even bigger benefits. As more business users work with data, many want clear instructions on how to work with data. However, \u201cit\u2019s a time-consuming process for us to offer users the help they need in order to get started. But the more we get into it, the more they\u2019re able to use it on their own.\u201d\n\u201cVisualising processes, like in a ticket system\u201d is likely the next use case they\u2019ll explore with Vizlib, Christian concluded.\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019re glad we\u2019ve been able to support their migration from QlikView to Qlik Sense and boost adoption with Vizlib\u2019s familiar, intuitive user experience.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "\n\n\nThe need for real-time manufacturing insights\nAs a manufacturer, Crider Foods relies on up-to-date information to maintain and optimise everything from plant floor activities to logistics. Stale data is useless for manufacturers. Rather, they need real-time data to make the right decisions at the right time. To support this objective, their analytics use cases and solutions have evolved over the years.\nTheir starting point for working with data was basic: \u201cFive years ago, we ran 90 percent of this company using Microsoft Excel. So we\u2019ve come a long way,\u201d Joshua shared.\nBefore adopting Qlik Sense and Vizlib\u2019s value-adding solutions, the company\u2019s data processing was an arduous, lengthy process \u2013 taking up to seven days to gather and analyze key data! \u201cA week after a run, we would be able to look at the data about that run and see the major causes of any downtime; or how our performance was; or what the financial impact was,\u201d Joshua explained.\nYet, with Key Performance Indicator (KPI) information only available after such a lengthy period, the data was not effective in helping them improve operations, minimize errors, reduce costs, or otherwise understand or enhance any other manufacturing fundamentals. \u201cIf we learned something, we learned it seven days too late!\u201d\nToday, the situation is far different. With Qlik and Vizlib steering their Business Intelligence (BI), they have data available in near real-time to make improvements fast. Joshua affirmed,\n\n\u201cWe can make decisions that impact us before we\u2019ve even finished the day, and finish the day stronger than we would have without the information.\u201d\u00a0 Joshua Poole, Director, Crider Foods\n\n\u00a0\nUsing Qlik + Vizlib to streamline financial reporting\nCrider Foods now have access to near real-time reporting with Qlik Sense to make smarter decisions fast. \u201cSince a lot of our operational applications reload every five minutes or every minute, we\u2019re using Qlik to track how we\u2019re doing for the day and make adjustments as needed to make sure that we hit our goals and targets.\u201d\nYet, not all their BI use cases were covered fully by Qlik\u2019s native functionality. For example, Crider wasn\u2019t able to perform their financial reporting in a way that suited their workflows. To resolve this important business requirement, they searched for an additional solution to help them get more from their Qlik Sense. \u201cIt looked like we\u2019d have to implement an entire system just for financial reporting because we didn\u2019t have anything that suited our requirements. Qlik Sense wasn\u2019t really a great fit.\u201d\nLuckily, when Joshua and his team started researching options, they found Vizlib. \u201cIt was 100 percent Vizlib Finance that hooked me because we\u2019re trying to do financial reporting and I wanted to avoid buying another system,\u201d Joshua added. \u201cThankfully, Vizlib Finance enabled us to use Qlik Sense for our P&L reporting. There wasn\u2019t a really good way to do it prior to that.\u201d\n\nAnd that was certainly not the end of Crider Foods\u2019 success with Vizlib. To ensure everyone throughout their supply chain could understand and work with data at speed, they needed a broader, user-friendly solution to add to their Qlik analytics. \u201cWhen I saw Vizlib Collaboration with Writeback, that\u2019s what hooked me the most because that just opens up so many opportunities.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow Vizlib enabled more independent analysis in Qlik\nQlik Sense has helped Crider modernise its analytics. Yet, the usability that the platform offered was not meeting the manufacturer\u2019s broader data needs. As Joshua explains, \u201cWe\u2019ve been stuck with Qlik Sense, especially with reports that are very static. And if somebody wanted to make a change to a report, they had to reach out to me.\u201d\nHowever, when they combined Qlik\u2019s powerful analytics engine with Vizlib\u2019s user-friendly solution, they were able to leverage the low-code, familiar functionality of Vizlib\u2019s business solutions to open up data and insights to more users. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve learned about Qlik Sense, I had to teach myself. So being able to make Qlik more user-friendly with Vizlib is a big plus for us because we don\u2019t have a programmer.\u201d\nBy adding Vizlib to their BI, they enabled a more self-service approach to their data, insights, and decision making, \u201cwithout the help of a developer, programmer or other data specialist,\u201d Joshua confirmed.\nLooking once more to their financial reporting, these self-service benefits truly came to the fore. \u201cI used to have to go into SQL and change how accounts are classified. But, now the controller can go in and set up those classifications himself. And manage that data himself.\u201d With Vizlib Finance, Crider Foods has been able to adapt the way their reports work themselves for better usability.\nIn addition to improved usability, Vizlib also helped the food manufacturer save time and better support strategic decision making.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building our digital infrastructure so we can strategically support management, our executive team, or any of the vice presidents. If they ask for a report, we can get them whatever they\u2019re asking for within days or even a few hours, as opposed to weeks or months which is what it used to be.\u201d\n\n\nHow Vizlib products support real-time manufacturing decisions\nBeing able to input data on the fly and analyse the results instantly is a game-changer for manufacturers like Crider Foods. Joshua shared that Vizlib Collaboration not only produces the \u201cbiggest impact\u201d but also that\n\n\u201cVizlib Writeback Table\u00a0takes Qlik from reporting only to data entry as well. That\u2019s the most radical change for us.\u201d Joshua Poole, Director, Crider Foods\n\nThe functionality of Vizlib Collaboration enables them to streamline their manufacturing workflows.\n\n\u201cVizlib Collaboration is just fantastic. And the great thing about it is I can create a web form for somebody who barely knows how to use a computer so they can input data that goes straight to a dashboard for somebody else. And you do that in 20 minutes. It\u2019s insane. Before we had to pay people to make a web form or it would take me weeks to do. That\u2019s the biggest value that I see with Vizlib Collaboration and Server.\u201d Joshua Poole, Director, Crider Foods\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, their initial use case in finance has also been supercharged with Vizlib\u2019s Writeback capabilities. \u201cWe definitely chose Vizlib for Vizlib Finance. But now we\u2019re also using writeback with the Finance Report. Instead of having to manage a spreadsheet, Writeback Table has made it more user-friendly for us. It feels like going into a spreadsheet and changing something to change the dashboard is not a professional application.\n\nBut by using Vizlib\u2019s Writeback capabilities, it feels like something you\u2019d see in a fortune 500 company!\u201d Joshua Poole, Director, Crider Foods\n\nCrider Foods also use Vizlib Library extensively. For example, Vizlib Calendar. \u201cVizlib Calendar is in every single app that I\u2019ll make. I love the configurability and everything there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe future of Crider Foods\u2019 analytics\nThe next step in modernising Crider Foods\u2019 BI will focus on improving long-term decision making through more what-if analysis. Joshua added that \u201cwe have some apps set up using what-if scenarios for scheduling using the Qlik and Vizlib\u2019s Writeback capabilities. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re doing most of our development for now.\u201d\nForward-thinking data leaders, like Crider Foods, are becoming more data-driven with the right BI tools. And they know how valuable their data is, especially as industry leaders! Helping our customers get the right insights at the right time with Qlik + Vizlib, means they\u2019re working smarter, and that\u2019s exactly the way we like it!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

And, as they like to put it, \u201ckeep the urban world moving, safely, comfortably and efficiently, 24/7 worldwide\u201d.\nSince Schindler manufactures, installs, services and modernizes elevators, escalators and moving walks for almost every type of building requirement worldwide, the amount of valuable data amassed within the company is staggering.\nWe are talking to Erich Muff, Senior Manager, Center of Excellence for Data Innovation & Transformation at Schindler Elevator Corporation and Qlik Luminary 2019, about Schindler\u2019s approach to data visualization and what led them to Vizlib.\nMaking data more accessible. For everyone\nOne of the key benefits of leveraging data visualization in business is the ability to convey complex information in a user-friendly and understandable manner. And for organizations that strive to nurture a true data-driven culture, finding a way to quickly onboard and engage users is a huge success factor.\nSchindler found they can tick all those boxes by using Vizlib\u2019s advanced value-added products for Qlik Sense to take their data visualizations to a whole new level.\n\nWe visualize data to allow our teams to access their data in an easily digestible way that helps them make the right business decisions, fast\u201dsays Erich Muff.\n\nEmpowering decision-makers to turn data into insights with just a few clicks can have an overwhelmingly positive effect on the overall business performance. Talking about the top use cases for data visualization at Schindler, Erich Muff explains:\n\n\nOur field teams use data visualizations to lead their weekly sales and operations meetings and drill-down into ad-hoc issues quickly. Besides, all our teams look at the same data visualizations, which saves us a lot of time explaining what the data means and allows us to make decisions faster than ever before.\n\nVizlib\u2019s plug-and-play value-added products come in particularly handy when organisations require a more dynamic way to interact with their data. Whether it\u2019s drilling down to uncover meaningful insights or using interactive charts like the Sankey to visualise data flows and spot trends, users can start visualising data in seconds, without any technical knowledge.\nKeen to learn what Erich\u2019s favourite Vizlib capabilities are, we get a quick and confident answer: \u201cSankey Chart and Bar Chart are the best!\u201d\n\nVizlib as a means of driving data adoption\nWhat are the biggest hurdles in driving data adoption in large organisations? Erich Muff counts three and walks us through his tried-and-tested solutions.\n\nExample of Vizlib dashboards\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n1. Building trust\nOf non-technical functions in need for automation and simple visualisations.\n\n2. Getting started\nHave the team take their first steps ( just do it, don\u2019t be afraid) and learn the basics of how to make use of the available data in an impactful and scalable way.\n\n3. Elevating Data Literacy\nTrain the team to visualize their key message and make the data tell a clear story. It takes a little bit of practice and a change towards a best-in-class mindset.\n\nTo improve the speed and effectiveness of their decision-making process, Schindler searched for a standardised way to customise their data visualisations and increase data adoption across the organization. It\u2019s BARDESS, Schindler\u2019s Qlik Sense implementation consultant, that introduced the Vizlib solution.\n"

The team at CONTEXT uses Vizlib\u2019s solution to expand the Business Intelligence capabilities of Qlik. We met with Nick McGuigan, Analytics Design Manager at CONTEXT, to reflect on how Vizlib\u2019s data visualization and analytics solutions have supercharged the team\u2019s processes.\nHow Vizlib enhances Qlik Sense\u2019s capabilities\nIn their own words, \u2018[CONTEXT] enables you to make informed Business Intelligence decisions today and plan for tomorrow. For over 35 years, technology vendors, distributors and retailers have trusted our data to inform commercial decisions and solve business challenges.\u2019\nIn order to make this possible, the team at CONTEXT must stay up to date with the latest Business Intelligence, data science and data visualization technology. CONTEXT identified Vizlib as a great match for their needs when their data visualization tool, QlikView, migrated to Qlik Sense. Some of the business analytics and data visualization capabilities were lost during the tool\u2019s migration.\n\nWe used QlikView for a very long time, and lots of the things that we were doing with QlikView were no longer possible in Qlik Sense. So it was quite difficult to transition customers over from QlikView to Qlik Sense.\n\nVizlib reinstated the capabilities of the tool. This meant that the team at CONTEXT was able to continue their usual data visualization and Business Intelligence processes with minimal disruption, despite the changes from Qlik. Nick said:\n\nWe use Vizlib\u2019s Sheet Menu, filter objects, the bar chart, line chart, bubble, advanced text button, combo chart, shot container\u2026 You name it, we use it.\n\n\nImproved navigation for users\n\nAdopting our branding into the tool via the Sheet Menu was hyper important to us\u2026 because we have our reports that exist within our own portal. The customer logs in and then goes from there, into the app and to have continued continuity of the marketing.\n\nVizlib Sheet Menu is a tool that enables teams to create a web-like user experience within a Qlik Sense dashboard. It is designed to make it quick and easy for users to navigate between groups and sheets.\nThe team at CONTEXT uses Vizlib Sheet Menus to help their users navigate dashboards more intuitively. What\u2019s more, the CONTEXT team has the ability to customise, style and format Vizlib Sheet Menu items to suit their brand. This means that their users can enjoy a consistent, clear and familiar experience.\n\nThe Sheet Menu has to be one of the biggest functionality improvements on the \u201cvanilla\u201d Qlik Sense for us, because we can adopt the same branding [and] we can change how the navigation works. So, the Sheet Menu makes that really fantastic and makes that possible.\n\n\nNew ways to present data visualizations\nUsing Vizlib has also enabled the team at CONTEXT to create more impressive-looking dashboards with improved functionality. They use filters within their dashboards to control the selection of data that is displayed. This helps the user to focus on the data that the team wants to highlight when handling large data sets.\nIn this way, the team at CONTEXT can ensure that they create visualizations that are effective, fit for purpose and easy to understand. What\u2019s more, Vizlib tools such as Bar Chart enable elements to be overlapped to make the best use of the space, while still highlighting all of the key takeaways. As Nick explains,\n\nWe like to have lots of filters in the sheet and the dashboards. But obviously this takes up a lot of space. Some of the Vizlib extensions make it possible to\u2026 count and overlap the objects. So those are really important, that\u2019s critical functionality for us.\n\n\nSumming up \nCONTEXT is one of many Vizlib customers that lost functionality during the QlikView migration to Qlik Sense, but has since regained and even expanded the possibilities of data visualization within Qlik with Vizlib\u2019s purpose-built solutions.

        "content": "\n\nWhen Vodafone created a dedicated Data Visualisation team within their Business Intelligence department 3 years ago, they were looking for a more effective and impactful way to communicate data. As one of the world\u2019s leading mobile communications providers, operating in 26 countries and in partnership with networks in over 55 more, Vodafone had a lot of complex data that needed to be turned into insights. That\u2019s when they decided to partner with Vizlib and let their data do the talking. We are chatting with Senad Music, Senior Manager BI Analytics at Vodafone, about the company\u2019s journey with Vizlib and Qlik Sense.\nFinding a solution that cuts through the noise\nThere are so many different sources that must be combined and explored to make meaningful discoveries. It\u2019s hard work. And business users don\u2019t really care how the data is sourced and visualised \u2013 as long as they get their answers in a neat and understandable format. Which means a solution that\u2019s both powerful and pleasant on the eye is the only way forward.\n\n\u201cData visualisation plays a much bigger role at Vodafone compared to 3 years ago when we started a dedicated Visualisation team within Business Intelligence, but it feels that we are still just scratching the surface of what is possible. Like any large, federated corporate organisation, there is a lot of complexity and visualisation simplifies the messages, cuts through all the noise to serve the relevant decision makers with clear and fresh insights.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s quite common that BI teams end up having to build their own custom solutions to meet business requirements. And when that happens, choosing the right partners becomes a priority.\n\u201cQlik Sense is one of our primary visualisation delivery engines for when an application needs to be available on mobile devices or when we are creating integrated mashups solutions with \u2018writeback\u2019 or notifications elements. The business largely doesn\u2019t know (or need to) what technologies go into the mix as long as their \u2018problem gets resolved\u2019,\u201d explains Music.\nFurther expanding on their approach to using technologies as \u201cbuilding blocks to deliver a wide range of agile business solutions\u201d, Music talks about embracing Qlik Sense extensions.\nQlik Sense was and still is a relatively young tool and sometimes simply lacking features for which we don\u2019t want to wait 1 or 2 years to appear. Extensions are like apps on your smartphone \u2013 you will never buy a phone that has pre-installed all the apps you will ever need.\n\n\u201cData Visualisation simplifies the message and cuts through all the noise to serve the relevant decision makers with clear and fresh insights.\u201d\n\nMoving Faster with Vizlib\nTalking about what Vodafone were capable of achieving as a result of deploying Vizlib\u2019s value-added products for Qlik Sense, Senad Music was open:\n\n\u201cVizlib gave us a significant development acceleration boost, saving us time by being able to leverage a comprehensive pack of value-added products ready to use while also giving us assurance around sustainability of the solutions we create.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe no longer need large numbers of developers being distracted with every new browser or Qlik release. Compatibility maintenance is now externalised at much lower cost as Vizlib maintains the same value-added products for many customers.\u201d\nAs the appetite for powerful and slick-looking dashboards continues to grow, BI managers have no choice but to source solutions that can deliver the wow factor.\n\nA great-looking front page with \u201cdesigner quality\u201d KPIs is a winning element when it comes to getting the buy-in from new customers,\u201d says Senad Music.\n\nAnd the ability to deliver quality, on time and at a competitive price is what made Vizlib Vodafone\u2019s partner of choice.\n\u201cWe were able to get some great capabilities without having to specify every detailed requirement, while, at the same time, most of our detailed needs were incorporated into the final product,\u201d remembered Senad Music.\n\u201cTables have never been a strong feature in Qlik. But our senior finance community, including some key decision-makers, are very keen on perfectly formatted tables, so Vizlib Pivot table was crucial.\u201d\n\nVizlib KPI Designer\n\u00a0\n\nVizlib Pivot Table\n"

But Prorail has effectively used Qlik analytics with Vizlib to leverage data for just that purpose.\nSince they\u2019re dealing with such critical data, KPIs are a crucial visual component of their business intelligence. \u201cWe have certain KPIs that we measure and have to report on. And this reporting is done via our Qlik solutions,\u201d Marten Louisse, a Business Intelligence Developer at ProRail, explained.\nAlong with reporting externally to government stakeholders, the company uses Qlik Sense for reporting on daily operational insights.\nBut not all of their reporting was always performed in Qlik Sense. Prorail was recently faced with the task of migrating their key data from QlikView to Qlik Sense. \u201cWe had a really extensive QlikView landscape that was important for decision-making, with so many essential KPIs reported by the landscape and all the reporting tools we had connected to it. It had a prominent place in the organization.\u201d\nSo how did they manage the transition and maintain the analytics functionality they needed?\n\n\u201cIn order to keep all the essential functionalities intact, we needed something that could offer more than standard Qlik Sense objects could. And in that way, Vizlib has really helped us out!\u201d Marten shared.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdding more visual power with Vizlib\n\u201cA couple of years ago, we did a proof of concept when we started thinking about migrating our QlikView products to Qlik Sense. But with the standard Qlik Sense functionalities, we were missing some key functionalities.\u201d\nThey were missing the additional QlikView features such as conditional formatting, actions, and a wide range of customisation options. They knew they\u2019d need to find alternatives to continue producing quality visualizations for their analysis.\nLuckily, the team was able to upgrade their Qlik solution quickly and smoothly. Thanks to the added functionality and customisation of Vizlib, they could easily maintain all their critical data and daily reporting, internally and externally.\n\n\n\u201cWith Vizlib Library, we were really able to have one-for-one the same functionalities that we were used to. And it also makes it a lot easier for our users to get used to the new dashboard. So, yeah, Vizlib really helped a lot with the migration process.\u201d\u00a0 Marten Louisse, Business Intelligence Developer, Prorail\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe added benefits of Vizlib in their BI\n\nIn response to how Vizlib has helped the company, Marten responded, \u201cIn general, it just works very well. The user interface is intuitive.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to what Prorail considers their favourite Vizlib product, Marten shared that Vizlib Library was at the top of the list. \u201cWe use many of the Library extensions, including Vizlib Line Chart, Bar Chart, Table and Pivot Table, and Container Grid\u201d\nVizlib Table and Container Grid have been integral in easing their transition from QlikView to Qlik Sense \u2013 re-creating some of the dashboards that contain many conditional show functions in QlikView. \u201cIn QlikView, we used a lot of columns just for calculations, where they\u2019re hidden in the visualizations, but used to calculate other columns.\u201d And they found this particular function lacking in Qlik Sense. Luckily, they could \u201cdo the same thing in Sense now with the Vizlib objects. So it was easy to migrate.\u201d\n\nMarten also praised Vizlib\u2019s customer service and support:\n\n\u201cThe customer service is really good. We are really happy with that. When we have a problem, we know we can always address it. Plus, the follow-ups are really good.\u201d Marten Louisse, Business Intelligence Developer, Prorail\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nA brighter visual future with Vizlib\nWhen it comes to the future of Prorail\u2019s analytics journey, Martin said they plan to still try additional Vizlib Library extensions. And \u201cfind out about potential opportunities to further optimize the data insights and customer experience, such as Vizlib Sankey Chart, Flow Chart, Heatmap, Waterfall Chart, Ridgeline Plot, and Combo Chart for example.\u201d Also, Trellis Mode in Vizlib Self Service.\nPlus, Vizlib Gantt is also on their radar. \u201cWe\u2019ve been using it already for two or three projects but in just the simple functionalities for now. But, we have a bigger project coming up, so that\u2019s the most important I think.\u201d\nAnd they\u2019ll also be looking into predictive modeling in the near future.\n\u00a0\nWith easy, supported access to such a comprehensive toolkit with Vizlib, Prorail\u2019s analytics journey \u2013 much like the rail journeys they manage every day \u2013 promises to be both exciting and efficient.\n\n\n\n"

They invited us to join a demonstration as we were rolling out Qlik Sense. We were blown away, and very quickly realised the value Vizlib could have to our business.\u201d Anna-Lee Munns, IT Director | JBS\n\nJBS was undergoing a transition from QlikView to Qlik Sense. The front-end functionality of QlikView had enabled high usage rates across the business. When the decision was made to move applications to Qlik Sense, the team were conscious of ensuring the same levels of functionality. Vizlib was the key.\nFollowing an initial trial of Vizlib\u2019s writeback capability and then an implementation of Vizlib Library and Finance, the use of Vizlib has gone from strength to strength with a number of successful use cases across the business.\n\u00a0\n\nWriteback reduces complexity\nIn one of their business units, there are 4-5 plants across the business. Every day 10-12 employees would arrive at the plant and complete a report within Excel. The data within these sheets would be linked to other Excel sheets and each day this information would have to be manually inputted.\nAdd more dashboarding power to Qlik Sense\nThe developers started using writeback capabilities and built an app, whereby the employees could input the data directly into a Vizlib Writeback Table so it could be used as the basis of the daily meetings. There have been significant time savings, not only in terms of inputting data, but removing the complexity and issues caused by relying on linked Excel sheets.\n\u00a0\n\nTimesaving across the business\nThrough the use of Qlik Sense and Vizlib, JBS has realised significant time-saving benefits across its business units. Labour is an ongoing important issue, which has been further complicated by the pandemic. Having an application to see and analyse information is a major differentiator. Before using Qlik Sense and Vizlib, this data was in spreadsheets and siloed across multiple plants, making it difficult to see the big picture and take action on the data.\nBy using Qlik Sense and Vizlib for labour applications, it has given a complete view of what\u2019s happening in close to real-time which gives the team on the ground the insight to make the right decisions. Furthermore, across five different labour reports, JBS has saved over 40 hours per week in manpower in compiling this information.\nThrough the combination of Qlik Sense and Vizlib, procurement has made a monthly time saving from 2 weeks across 7 people to 1 day, freeing up the department to focus on other areas that drive greater value-add to the business.\nWith the help of Vizlib Custom Report and Vizlib Self Service, they are benefitting from greater supplier visibility, simplified RFP processes \u2013 removing the need to manually assemble and manipulate SAP data, and the training time needed for new hires to access ERP data.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere are so many small wins on a daily basis realised through the time saved.\u201d says a procurement employee.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStreamlined analysis with improved forecasting visibility\nForecasting the worth of an animal and the value of each cut out is an ongoing business challenge. Marginal gains are critical in an increasingly competitive industry. Understanding the break-even amount when purchasing livestock is crucial.\nThe team previously had to rely on taking data from different sources and analysing this within Excel. Because of the different data sets and granularity across the business, it wasn\u2019t possible to do this without the manual adjust component and the visualisation capabilities available within Vizlib.\nThe speed at which the team can now produce P&Ls and the granularity of detail that can be included on a weekly basis has been transformed.\nThrough using Qlik Sense and Vizlib, the team have saved nearly 20GB of files storage each year, significantly improving accessibility.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cQlik is the engine that makes it happen but we\u2019re leveraging all of the visualisation capabilities from Vizlib.\u201d ANNA-LEE MUNNS IT Director | JBS\n\n\u00a0\n\nExponential growth in adoption\nSince the initial integration of Qlik Sense in late 2019, the adoption rate has grown exponentially. In 2020, a number of business units have moved their applications over to Qlik Sense. Complemented by a series of training sessions orchestrated by JBS, and the simplicity and powerful visualisation capabilities of Vizlib, the number of users has exploded.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOur adoption rate of Qlik Sense has grown significantly with the help of Vizlib.\u201d Anna-Lee Munns, IT Director | JBS\n\n\u00a0\n\nReduced downtime\nPlant maintenance and minimising downtime is a critical success factor. The plant maintenance teams used Qlik and Vizlib to provide greater visibility over their processes, increase communication so downtime was reduced, and costs controlled. One business unit was able to reduce maintenance spend below budget through the use of this application.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nDecision-making agility\nWith all JBS processes now supported by a custom application, it has transformed the ability of senior stakeholders to make decisions based on how business units and departments are operating.\nThe sales leadership team across one business unit are close to receiving an application that leverages Vizlib Self Service, and the powerful visualization capability of Vizlib Library\u2019s KPIs and Sheet Menu. It will enable them to look at a customer holistically and give them access to data in a way that\u2019s never been possible before. In the near future, the team intends to add Vizlib Collaboration into this app so senior stakeholders can input data directly in the app with Vizlib Input Form, and further add value to the data.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe sales leadership team are incredibly excited about the launch of this application,\u201d says Munns. \u201cIt significantly increases our agility decision-making across the business.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nAnother sales team had an application that required data to be looked at in very specific ways. With the help of Vizlib, the app has exceeded expectations.\n\u00a0\n\nSteph Robinson, Qlik Manager, Business Intelligence, comments: \u201cWe were concerned how we were going to create what was required with an out-of-the-box solution. Vizlib has made it possible to put it together in ways we didn\u2019t think was possible.\u201d\n\nVizlib value-add\nWith over\u00a0250 applications\u00a0in production across the business and\u00a0120 developers, having help on hand to support when issues arise is essential.\n\u00a0\n\nWe feel very cared for by Vizlib. We know if we have a question or need some assistance, the customer team will be on hand to provide support. We regularly sit down with Vizlib and talk through our ideas and the great thing is we see action, with these new ideas often coming to fruition.\u201d\n-STEPH ROBINSON\nQlik Manager, BI | JBS\n\n"

        "content": "\n\n\nTWG was looking to pave the way for digital transformation\nTriangle facilitated the automation of internal processes with Jet Reports\nJet Reports increased productivity throughout TWG\n\nThomas Wellness Group (TWG) specializes in the design, manufacture, and implementation of projects in the fitness and wellness sector, creating fitness centers, spas, home gyms, and other wellness facilities for both commercial and individual clients.\nThomas Wellness Group strives to be the first choice for those who are thinking of designing and equipping a wellness space. They aim to be a reflection of the people who work in their company: a young, dynamic and innovative team where the desire to grow and attention to detail are manifest every day. Innovation, design, and technology are hallmarks of TWG\u2019s approach.\nBased in Madrid, Thomas Wellness has been in business since 1994 and has over 50 employees.\nThe Challenge \nAfter relocating and consolidating operations to a single location in 2016, Thomas Wellness Group sought to improve its internal processes and pave the way for digital transformation initiatives that the company knew would be critical to its ongoing success in the 2020s and beyond.\u00a0\nThe company was faced with growing complexity and struggled with manual processes that consumed valuable staff time and detracted from the core activities that generated value for the company and its clients. Company leadership clearly understood that the right technology systems were a pivotal element in becoming more efficient and scaling the company up.\u00a0\nAfter facing considerable difficulties with two previous ERP systems, leaders at the company were especially attentive to the need for a thorough process in evaluating and selecting the software that would help run the business efficiently. The company reached out to Triangle, a trusted technology advisor who worked with the company to explore options for a new ERP system. After a thorough vetting process, the company selected Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.\u00a0\nThe Plan\nAs TWG planned the rollout of its new ERP solution, the company realized it had an opportunity to elevate its automation and digital transformation to a new level by implementing a purpose-built reporting and analytics platform that could serve all of its analytics needs as it grew. A new ERP system meant a fresh opportunity to deploy a reporting system that could truly meet its needs, providing immediate access to information, eliminating manual effort, and providing a single source of truth for everyone in the organization.\nTWG also wanted to automate and streamline some of its customer-facing communications. Specifically, the company wanted a process for sending delivery notes to customers that would not require any manual intervention. TWG was looking for a product that could offer these process automation capabilities, which would save time, increase accuracy, and improve customer satisfaction.\nTWG turned again to Triangle for its expertise in technology solutions. Because Triangle\u2019s goal was to empower TWG users to manage inventory, supply chain, and finance with the use of Microsoft Business Central cloud technology, it took the time to understand in detail what TWG\u2019s reporting needs were and what functionalities could most benefit TWG\u2019s productivity. Triangle had previous experience working with purpose-built reporting tools and had met with great success deploying Jet Reports for its other clients, so when finance leaders at TWG expressed an interest in having a top-tier reporting platform, Triangle recommended the product to them.\nMaking It Happen\nTriangle\u2019s goal is to create long-term relationships with its customers, to help them get the most out of the implemented tool. Its Jet Reports training plans are designed to transfer the maximum knowledge of the product to the user. Triangle helped the team at TWG to configure Jet Reports to automate some of the internal processes at the company, as well as to design custom-tailored reports that could meet all of the company\u2019s needs. The team quickly got up and running with automated customer delivery notes.\nShortly thereafter, the company applied the same techniques to the daily operational reports it shared with suppliers. TWG wanted to keep its vendors informed about out-of-stock items, quantities required, and product codes. TWG used the Jet Reports Scheduler to generate those reports and immediately make them available securely to vendors.\nBecause the company was starting fresh with a new ERP system, it had no legacy reporting systems in place. This provided the company with an opportunity to create a new vision for its reporting and analytics, starting from scratch. Triangle worked with TWG to develop a library of reports for internal users, top management, and external stakeholders.\nAll three audiences were delighted with the results. Internal users gained immediate access to sales backlog reports and inventory status. Executive managers had accurate, up-to-the minute budget vs. actual reports that kept them informed of the company\u2019s financial standing. Sales leaders had access to order reports to keep them informed about the state of the company\u2019s future revenues.\nUsers have been especially happy about how easy it is to learn and use Jet Reports. They\u2019re now able to:\n\nReport on live Dynamics data from within Microsoft Excel.\nDrill down to transaction level data from any report.\nPublish reports to the web quickly, easily, and securely.\n\nUsers can also tailor reports to their specific needs very easily, and without specialized training. TWG\u2019s users in finance, sales, and operations are no longer dependent on the busy IT staff to develop or modify reports; if they need something new, they can make the change immediately, without expert help.\nThe Results\nJet Reports has led to increased productivity throughout the company, but especially in finance, operations, sales, and purchasing. The company has eliminated vast amounts of manual effort, doing away with many of the email and phone communications with customers and vendors that had bogged it down in the past.\nThe finance team at TWG estimates it has saved at least 3,500 Euros per year by using Jet Reports, just based on their ability to automate reports using Jet Reports and the Jet Scheduler. In the operations department alone, they estimate that they are saving about 15 hours per month.\nThe finance team has been able to shrink their reporting cycles and eliminate manual effort as well. They no longer have to dump data from the ERP and manipulate the data in Excel. Today, they can simply build refreshable reports using easy-to-configure, pre-built templates.\nLaura Martinez, ERP Project\u202fManager at Thomas Wellness Group describes how the company has benefited from using Jet Reports: \u201cNormally when we think about a purpose-built reporting tool, we don\u2019t necessarily think about automation. But here at Thomas Wellness, we very much see Jet Reports as a vehicle for automation and digital transformation. It has changed the way we do business, and today, most of our team cannot imagine going back to the old ways of doing things. Jet Reports helps us to perform at the top of our game.\u201d\nTo find out more about what Jet Reports can do, schedule a demo with insightsoftware today.\n"

        "content": "\n\n\nThe team at Grafix Plastics knew they needed a more efficient monthly reporting process but were waiting for the right product at the right time.\nThey learned of Spreadsheet Server, an excel add-in that integrates with their ERP to automate manual processes and streamline reporting.\nSince implementation, month-end close is completed two days sooner thanks to automated report generation and more efficient transaction drill-downs.\n\nFor 60 years Grafix Plastics has been a leading supplier of plastic film and sheet plastic for industrial, commercial, and consumer purposes. Grafix Plastics sells a wide variety of custom-manufactured commodity and specialty films to over 1,000 different industrial and manufacturing customers, from startups and small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. As a go-to resource in the plastics industry, Grafix is dedicated to a mission of innovation, detail orientation, product knowledge, and commitment to outstanding customer service.\n\nIt Was Time for a Change\nFor years, Grafix Plastics Industrial Products division president, Jordan Katz, knew that his team needed a better internal data management solution, but the old adage of \u2018if it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it\u2019 kept him from making a change. While Katz was aware of Spreadsheet Server\u2019s ability to streamline Grafix\u2019 reporting, he did not see the need for an eminent change because the system the business had in place was working.\nUntil it wasn\u2019t.\nWhen their office manager \u2013 the single owner of Grafix\u2019 general ledger and monthly reporting \u2013 announced her upcoming retirement, Katz knew the time had come to make a change. It was the perfect opportunity to invest in Spreadsheet Server and see how it could create efficiencies and help improve their internal processes.\n\nSpreadsheet Server Was a No-Brainer\nFor many businesses, there is a lengthy research and discovery process involved when deciding which software to invest in, but for Grafix Plastics the decision couldn\u2019t have been easier.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been using SYSPRO as an ERP platform since 2001 and along the way, we became aware that there was this Excel add-on that would allow us to probe our financial data and ERP data in a little bit more of a direct way,\u201d Katz explained.\nWhy Spreadsheet Server was the first, and only, choice for the team at Grafix Plastics:\n\nSpreadsheet Server would integrate seamlessly with their ERP to get them up and running quickly.\nThey now have the ability to drill down to transaction data to find and fix errors and inconsistencies.\nThey can automate previously manual processes, saving time and eliminating the potential for errors.\nThey can share financial reports directly with their accounting partners and both teams can work within the same version without a drawn-out back-and-forth save process.\n\n\u201cThe way Spreadsheet Server pulls and formats data from different sources and modules during drill-down is a major time saver and very impressive. It fulfills that need to be able to not only automatically generate our financial statements in real-time, but to be able to drill down and pull out all the data.\u201d\u00a0\nFaster Processes and Better Results \nReal-Time Drill-Down\nThe main feature Katz was looking for, and the benefit his team enjoys the most when working with Spreadsheet Server, is the ability to drill down to transaction-level general ledger data in real time without leaving Excel.\n\u201cBeing able to have that live view into the data in detail becomes enormously helpful when trying to close and balance,\u201d said Katz. \u201cI mean, it would take forever if we were using traditional reports, so it really is a huge benefit.\u201d\n\nNative Excel Functionality\nPart of why Katz was so interested in Spreadsheet Server was that it is an Excel add-in that allows his team to easily export data from SYSPRO into Excel with one click rather than spending time on manual downloads and CSV files.\nSpreadsheet Server provides Grafix Plastics with:\n\nShort setup time.\nMinimal user training.\nSpeedy return on investment.\n\n\u201cSpreadsheet Server is pretty straightforward to navigate through,\u201d said Katz. \u201cThe great thing about it is once it\u2019s set up, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s bulletproof.\u201d\n\nTimely Collaboration\nThanks to Spreadsheet Server\u2019s integration with SYSPRO, Grafix was able to improve its financial statement review process with its accountants.\n\u201cSpreadsheet Server lets us send our accountants our financial statements with backup sheets and they can just send us back their comments and updates within the reports,\u201d Katz explains. \u201cWe can repeat the comment and update process as often as needed without having to redo the reports. They automatically update.\u201d\nNot only has the improved efficiency in the financial statement review process saved time and energy for accounting, but it has allowed Grafix to decrease its accounting budget by decreasing billable hours.\n\nPre-Configured Queries\nKatz and his team have been extremely impressed with the way Spreadsheet Server pulls together relevant data during drill-down.\n\u201cBefore Spreadsheet Server, even though I had a mastery of the SQL tables in the data, if I had to do an investigation on something that went over across different modules, the data would be in different formats,\u201d said Katz. \u201cIt would take time to fuse the various sources so that the data could work with each other. And that already happens in the Spreadsheet Server drill-down. That\u2019s enormously powerful and time-saving.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Grafix Plastics\nCurrently, Spreadsheet Server is being used primarily for financial reporting, but there are many other potential applications for internal data management and processing. Katz intends to evaluate each department\u2019s data and reporting needs and train new teams on Spreadsheet Server as it makes sense to do so.\n\u201cBecause our financial information is accessible right there in Excel, Spreadsheet Server completely eliminated the need to compile financial statements,\u201d said Katz. \u201cIt cuts our month-end closing time by one to two days per month.\u201d\nTo see how real-time reporting with Spreadsheet Server can help your organization, schedule a demo today.\n"

        "company": "ESPO",
        "content": "\nBackground\nEastern Shires Purchasing Organisation (ESPO) is a professional buying organization serving public sector and education in the UK. For 40 years ESPO relied on printed catalogs as its primary sales tool, with ecommerce accounting for 20% of total sales in recent years. ESPO used insightsoftware\u2019s Agility PIM software to produce its catalogs and to feed a rudimentary website.\nIn 2019 it became clear that the existing website could not meet modern eCommerce best practices for filtering and searching, so ESPO committed to an all-new website. Magento Enterprise 2.3.7 was selected as the new Ecommerce platform, to be fed from Agility 8.0. This move would require ESPO\u2019s product information for 30,000 SKUs to be reimagined from print-centric to a format suitable for the requirements of Magento.\nDawn Zassick, Director of Professional Services for insightsoftware, and Claire Edwards, Head of Marketing at ESPO, spearheaded the project. Claire\u2019 ESPO team included two other full-time staffers and seven members of the sales team on an ad hoc basis.\nESPO Content: Fit for print, not for web\nThe team at ESPO quickly realized the massive scale of the project. ESPO\u2019s data model \u2014 its product information taxonomy and content \u2014 was not structured to fit Magento. It had been written for print format \u2013 heavy on text and ordering tables \u2013 but lacking data in key searchable or filterable attributes.\nAs Claire recounted, \u201cI\u2019d been a huge advocate of moving to a newer way of working, so I knew what was at stake. But when I realized the scope of the job, I said, crikey, this is a huge task! We didn\u2019t have categories for certain products, so we had to build a new taxonomy. And much of the data was in one common field that had to be parsed into whatever attributes were needed for a particular category.\u201d\nAccording to Dawn, \u201cThe breadth and complexity of the taxonomy took a lot of time to build out. ESPO had a wider range of offerings than most, with those 30,000 SKUs scattered across hundreds of different categories as opposed to just a handful of categories.\u201d\nMagento itself presented a hurdle of its own. Dawn added, \u201cMagento is very powerful, but unforgiving \u2026If you miss a required field, the web page fails to load. Problem is, Magento doesn\u2019t tell you what went wrong. That\u2019s where Agility tools become invaluable to identify gaps, errors and inconsistencies.\u201d\nProcess\nInitially, the ESPO team had to acknowledge the true value of their product information, and the contrast in behaviors of traditional catalog shoppers vs. eCommerce shoppers. Claire noted, \u201cOur product data hadn\u2019t been viewed as an asset \u2026 once we accepted that, it was easy to make the case that our data model had to change.\u201d\nDawn added, \u201cProduct information is an important as the products themselves because the information creates the customer experience. Ecommerce shoppers do not browse like catalog shoppers. They visit a website to search and filter for what they want, and they expect that functionality.\u201d\nThe gap between the existing content structure and the needs of Magento was immense. The print-centric data was text-heavy, with most of the specification buried in paragraphs or tables. This data had to be extracted and transferred into SKU-level attributes such as Color, Size, Dimensions, or Material.\nClaire noted, \u201cParsing of the data took more time and resources than we could have imagined\u201d. Two full-time ESPO staffers managed the bulk of the data migration into the new model. Seven members of the sales team lent their expertise to building out the category attributes for categories as different as stationery vs. gloves.\nThe new data model allowed products to be searchable and filterable based on logical features. ESPO was able to create choice lists of values (Color, Size, Gender) and other refinements to guide the customer journey.\nAdditionally, ESPO wanted to integrate its Frameworks into the same Magento platform, requiring the development of a second data model and corresponding Magento page template appropriate for these services products.\nThe Frameworks data only existed in Word documents and, like the product data, was inconsistently structured. insightsoftware created customized Excel import/export sheets by category for both products and Frameworks to assist ESPO in the data transfer.\nThe process to revise the data model, migrate the data and launch the new website took about one year.\nResults\nESPO realized an immediate lift from the new website. Ecommerce sales jumped 1% per week and crossed 30% threshold of total sales in ten weeks. Customer feedback was overwhelmingly positive.\nESPO plans to build off this early success on several fronts:\n\nSustain a commitment to having a dedicated content manager responsible for continuous maintenance activities\nInitiate a second pass through the product data to further improve the quality of the information and to refine filter and search capabilities\nCreate microsites for targeted markets\n\n\nSustain a commitment to having a dedicated content manager responsible for continuous maintenance activities\nInitiate a second pass through the product data to further improve the quality of the information and to refine filter and search capabilities\nCreate microsites for targeted markets\n\nESPO will remain a print catalog publisher. As Claire explained, \u201cCatalogs will always be important to us and our customers, particularly teachers. Our research shows that they rely on the books. The improvements we made with our product content in Agility has allowed us to shorten the production cycle time. We expect to do more catalogs, not less.\u201d\nLessons learned\nReflecting on this achievement, Claire made these thoughtful observations for companies facing a comparable situation:\n\nDedicate a person or persons to the task of maintaining the content\nManage expectations; upgrading an ecommerce site is a process with incremental milestone improvements\n\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily need to hire new staff, but your marketers and content staff need to think web-first because your ecommerce success will rise or fall on the quality of that data\nObtain as much budget and resources as you can to start, because the task will be bigger than you imagine\n\nESPO Information\nReflecting on this achievement, Claire made these thoughtful observations for companies facing a comparable situation:\n\n\n\n\nClient\nEastern Shires Purchasing Organisation (ESPO)\n\n\nLocation\nLeicester, UK\n\n\nIndustry\nDistribution\n\n\nTask\nAdapt product content for website relaunch\n\n\nNumber of SKUs\nApprox. 30,000\n\n\nTools\nMagento 2.3.7 and Agility 8.0\n\n\nCore team\nThree full time, seven part time\n\n\nTimeframe\nOne year\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "\n\nSouthco believes first impressions are critical. They have built an unmatched portfolio of access hardware solutions, through innovation and strategic acquisitions. Southco offerings include over 25,000 standard catalog products and more than 50,000 custom products that have been created to meet customers\u2019 design needs. In order to meet the ever-changing needs of their customers, Southco has built and invested in a strong global footprint of technical sales, marketing, engineering and manufacturing operations throughout the world.\nChallenges\nSouthco processed large external file uploads, such as outsourced payroll files, as well as vendor files and more traditional finance Journal Entries. Excel was their preferred software for data manipulation and they needed a way to easily and accurately upload that data into their newly implemented SAP system.\nThey desired a financial spreadsheet loader similar in function to their previous customized spreadsheet loader. Prior to learning about Magnitude Process Runner GLSU, Southco had built an LSMW program to convert legacy AR and AP data files. Work had begun with a contractor to custom build another program to convert legacy General Ledger account balances into SAP. However, they were eager to avoid another internal customized software which was expensive and time-consuming to program.\nSolution\nAt an SAP User Conference, an attendee from Southco noticed that Magnitude was well-referenced and decided to take a closer look at Process Runner GLSU. \u201cWe liked the fact that Process Runner GLSU let us do things ourselves rather than having to work with a developer,\u201d says Southco\u2019s SAP Business Analyst. \u201cAfter speaking to other users and examining Magnitude and Process Runner GLSU, we found Process Runner GLSU to be extremely user-friendly out of the box. While other programs required a high level of technical knowledge, Excel-based Process Runner GLSU perfectly fit our needs. After successfully testing the product, we told the developer to stop what he was doing, and we would just take it from there with Process Runner GLSU.\u201d\nSouthco\u2019s previous spreadsheet loader required a programmer to make changes, while Process Runner GLSU has flexible templates that enable users to quickly and securely modify templates without having to rely on IT. \u201cThat saves us the money spent on the developer\u2019s time and resources,\u201d Southco notes.\nResults\nEasy to Customize\nSouthco uses Process Runner GLSU in a variety of ways, including processing payroll, Visa card expenditures, vendor invoices, and profitability analysis adjustments. The Finance department frequently uses the dropped header functionality to process multiple documents within one template \u2013 often as many as 20 to 30 documents within one template. In addition, plans are in place to build more custom warning messages when running Process Runner GLSU pre-validations for AP invoices.\nMultiple Uses\nInitially, Process Runner GLSU simplified the large legacy data file conversions from Southco\u2019s previous system. The company estimates that they loaded approximately15,000-20,000 data lines without ever encountering issues associated with resources or response times.\nEfficient\nProcess Runner GLSU eliminates the need for a custom LSMW program and the associated time and effort of engaging a developer. More workload can be handled by fewer people. Instead of repeatedly keying in the same data, Southco reuses templates, saves them and renames them to the current month.\nBusiness Benefits\nProcess Runner GLSU fully complements the validation capabilities in SAP and contributes to better analytics. Entering data is now easier and much more accurate, which has delivered increased productivity. Secure sign-on through SAP ensures that the same robust security features of SAP are found in Process Runner GLSU.\nTo continue to save time and effort, Southco\u2019s uses for Process Runner GLSU include:\n\nProcessing freight invoices from various carriers\nProcessing travel and expense reports\nProcessing invoices from relocation service agency\nAdditional GL legacy data conversions for European and Asia Pacific SAP implementations carriers\nDay-to-day financial process uploads in other geographies\n\n"

Headquartered in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada, their customers include retailers, publishers and commercial printers in North America, Latin America, the Pacific Rim and Europe.\nChallenges\nMonth-end was continually bogged down by Catalyst\u2019s cumbersome manual FI upload into SAP. The company had created a custom line layout in Excel to copy and paste non-standard entries, one page at a time, into SAP.\n\u201cThe bulk of the month-end process was manual \u2013 a long, tedious process,\u201d a Senior SAP Functional Analyst reported. \u201cIt took two to three days just to enter all the journal entries, forcing us to use every person available.\u201d\nAttempts to create an in-house direct-upload solution were not successful. Customized options (such as an ABAP tool) did not provide validation of the data before loading meaning only a few individuals could utilize the template \u2013 power users, who generated very large month-end journal entries.\nThe situation soon came to a head when the need arose to migrate the pulp side of their business into SAP. Users on the legacy system adamantly refused to use the manual process. Faced with migrating 30,000 lines into SAP, the company knew it was time for an automated upload solution.\nSolution\nCatalyst evaluated Magnitude Process Runner GLSU and quickly deemed it the ideal solution. \u201cProcess Runner GLSU was a forerunner from the beginning,\u201d their Senior SAP Functional Analyst described. \u201cProcess Runner GLSU was polished and had validation tools to avoid the various pitfalls of loading and posting journal vouchers to SAP.\u201d\nThe SAP migration project manager agreed. \u201cWe chose Process Runner GLSU over competitive solutions for its simplicity and ease of use. If the tool was not effortless, it would never be adopted fully by the user population.\u201d\nInitially, Process Runner GLSU was used to post information from three legacy systems with uploads of over 999 lines. \u201cUsing Process Runner GLSU, two weeks of work took three days to enter into SAP.\u201d Now freight vendors, with many invoices, simply email their customized Excel file to our AP clerk, who copies the template into Process Runner GLSU, then posts it directly \u2013 often the day it is received. The result: vendors are paid more quickly than ever before.\nSeveral Process Runner GLSU templates are also being used for COPA entries. Month-end variances can be time-consuming, but the templates can be downloaded into Excel and then populate Process Runner GLSU. \u201cThat\u2019s been really good \u2013 I don\u2019t know how keen our accountants would be to do that work manually\u201d. Altogether, over 20 Process Runner GLSU templates and all complex calculations are now done in Process Runner GLSU. In some cases, the only change needed is to the posting date before upload. Best of all, month-end pressure is alleviated. With Process Runner GLSU, entries are done throughout the month.\nResults\nEasily Accessible Information\nSince entries are detailed and not just summaries, everyone can get the information they need. \u201cAccountants no longer have to provide an explanation of the information found in the spreadsheet,\u201d noted their Senior SAP Functional Analyst. \u201cThe spreadsheets are self-explanatory and provide drill-downs for further information.\u201d\nImproved Accuracy and Flexibil\u00adity\nBefore Process Runner GLSU, there were many data input errors. Now, accuracy is much improved with fewer errors. Other functions such as foreign currency posting are also easy with Process Runner GLSU.\nEfficient User Training\n\u201cThe first thing a new accountant learns is how to post using Process Runner GLSU. They learn the secrets of Process Runner GLSU and the theory behind it and boom, they are posting journal entries on the first day!\u201d\nCentralized Control Saves Time\nAlthough some of the Excel models are very complex, everything is linked directly into Process Runner GLSU templates, so users only need to change posting dates, then post the entries. Process Runner GLSU is populated based on calculations they\u2019ve entered.\nBusiness Benefits\nBetter information and improved productivity enables users to conduct more detailed analysis for better decision-making. \u201cOur business analysts can do more than ever before, and even junior accountants are doing analysis. Managers can look at their cost center reports and see the detail without contacting an accountant to explain it, giving them new speed and flexibility on the job.\u201dMonth-end closing is definitively faster. \u201cNobody does a manual entry anymore, even if it\u2019s just two lines. As a result, we\u2019re finding that users are putting in a lot more detail.\u201dFinance users simply can\u2019t get enough of Process Runner GLSU. \u201cThere would be a revolt if we ever took Process Runner GLSU away from our users.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nThe Databricks story begins in Northern California: While at the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s AMPLab data-analytics research center, then-PhD student Matei Zaharia and professor Ion Stoica decided that they could create a faster data-processing engine to overcome what they saw as performance limitations in the Hadoop data-access model. They built Spark, the open-source cluster- computing framework for Hadoop, open-sourced it in 2010, and turned it over to the Apache Software Foundation in 2013.\nLater that year, the two\u2014now re-titled as corporate CTO and CEO, respectively\u2014joined with a cohort of their AMPLab colleagues to found Databricks and offer a commercial distribution for Spark, as well as related services. Along the way, they attracted interest, investment, and even a few board members from influential Silicon Valley venture capital firms NEA and Andreesen Horowitz. Databricks\u2019 mission was funded, unambiguous, and ambitious: Revolutionize how data analysts could extract more value from Big Data.\nKey Requirements\n\nODBC connectivity\nDirect SQL-to-Spark capability\n\n\nExtensibility\nWindows, Linux, and Mac platform support\n\nChallenges\nSpark offers massive data-processing performance improvement (up to 100x) over MapReduce. The Databricks suite of offerings has grown to include the Databricks Cloud platform supported with Spark SQL (which supplanted Shark).\nBut as they assessed the data analytics market space, Stoica, Zaharia, and team realized that Spark\u2014no matter the performance\u2014would succeed only if analysts could access Spark data using their preferred BI tools and methods.\n\u201cThe second you try to tell people that they need to change their tools to use their underlying data store, you\u2019ve lost,\u201d observes Databricks\u2019 Customer Engagement Lead, Arsalan Tavakoli-Shiraji. \u201cIt was a no-brainer for us: If we want to get adoption going forward, we need to support these tools. It\u2019s just table stakes.\u201d\nSolution\nThat realization meant ensuring Spark ODBC connectivity to BI tools like Tableau, Excel, Microstrategy, Qlik, and others. More importantly, those target analysts needed to be able to get at Spark data using the data-query approach with which they were most familiar: SQL. And that led Databricks to Magnitude.\n\u201cWhen you look at the marketplace \u2026 [when] you talk to any of the people in the space, Simba is the answer if you want to provide that connectivity,\u201d explains Tavakoli-Shiraji.\nDatabricks selected Magnitude to provide its ODBC 3.8 Data Connector for Databricks Spark SQL, its powerful SQL-query engine for Apache Spark. Databricks now includes the driver free of charge in its Databricks Cloud platform. For Databricks, the Simba ODBC Data Connector enables Databricks customers to query their Spark data with their preferred BI tool (like Tableau, Excel, Qlik, MicroStrategy, or others) on Windows, Linux, and Mac.\n\u201cOne of the top most-requested features for Databricks Cloud is \u2018Plug in my BI tools to work with this,\u2019\u201d says Tavakoli-Shiraji. \u201cWhat\u2019s the simplest way to get people going?

        "content": "\n\nIndependent SAP consultant George Khatcherian works with customers across a wide range of industries including chemical, manufacturing, pharmacy, ministry of defense, and utilities. A chartered management accountant by trade, Khatcherian was introduced to SAP when assisting with a customer\u2019s ERP implementation. Focused on the full spectrum of Finance functionality, he has assisted customers as an SAP consultant with system implementation on both the business and finance sides.\nChallenges\nWhen clients upgrade to SAP, Khatcherian helps them evaluate present and future financial needs during implementation, identifies any gaps within SAP functionality, and then builds a solution that best meets those needs.\n\u201cFor Finance, there is always a requirement for mass journal uploads to SAP,\u201d says Khatcherian. Although consultants can identify the tool needed, map templates to be read in SAP, and develop a solution to meet identified needs, building such a tool costs time and money. Additionally, it does not address future needs and offers no real flexibility to adapt by changing fields or columns. \u201cIt takes a lot of effort and imposes limitations on how the business can use the tool,\u201d Khatcherian notes.\nSolution\nKhatcherian was introduced to Magnitude (then Z Option) by his client, who had seen a demo of Process Runner GLSU (formerly Z Option GLSU). The client asked whether a built solution would offer the same functionality for the same cost as a long-term solution like GLSU. \u201cAlthough the client was happy with the GLSU functionality, they needed reassurance it would not have an adverse impact on SAP, and that ownership costs were aligned to a (custom-built) solution. After I saw what GLSU could do, I advised them to purchase GLSU,\u201d Khatcherian says. \u201cThe initial cost was less, and its usability offered a great deal of \u2018future-proofing.\u2019\u201d\nKhatcherian wrote a step-by-step guide for creating templates in GLSU, and he became the main point of contact for training and support until the conclusion of the client\u2019s SAP implementation. \u201cThey loved using GLSU and adopted it as their main way to enter journals,\u201d he adds. Years later, they are still using it.\nWhen a second customer began looking for ways to do mass financial uploads, Khatcherian again recommended GLSU. \u201cWhen I go to a client,\u201d Khatcherian notes, \u201cif they\u2019re having a problem with mass uploads, then GLSU is always a viable option to consider.\u201d\nResults\nReduces the Learning Curve\nSince it\u2019s Excel-based, GLSU is very familiar to anyone in finance. \u201cYou can create many lines in one journal, which is much friendlier than SAP,\u201d Khatcherian says. \u201cIt\u2019s as easy as feeding the data into the upload spreadsheet, putting in the date, and pressing a button to upload.\u201d\nBuilt-in Error Validation\nThe validation check ensures the numbers will balance prior to batch upload, so the time-consuming process of finding the balance errors in SAP is eliminated. \u201cGLSU offers such efficiency and process improvement,\u201d Khatcherian says. \u201cIt finds any errors very quickly and easily.\u201d\nFlexible and Adaptable\nAccording to Khatcherian, the biggest differentiator for GLSU is its ability to combine any combination of fields, handle multiple journals in the same worksheet, and manage customers or vendors all in the same file. \u201cGLSU provides all the key financial table fields into Excel,\u201d he notes. \u201cSo if I want to create a journal, I simply select any field or line item detail to create a template, which means the same spreadsheet can be used to upload anything that is finance related. That is a very big plus to what we could build, which is based on specific requirements and doesn\u2019t offer that flexibility.\u201d\nUp and Running with Dependable Support\n\u201cBy the time I leave the client, they are familiar with the product,\u201d Khatcherian says. \u201cAfter that, they can go directly to Magnitude for support, which is something Magnitude always makes so easy.\u201d\nBenefits\nKhatcherian says SAP clients are looking for easy-to-use tools with consistent results. He recommends GLSU for large uploads, for clients with limited access to SAP, and those who have difficult input requirements. \u201cI believe it is the ideal solution for what it does,\u201d he states simply. \u201cAny customer I work with is potentially a candidate for GLSU,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be installed in any SAP environment, whether on the existing platform, a new implementation, or an upgrade. It will work for them, even if they already had an upload tool.\u201d\nMagnitude allows trial installations to facilitate further investigation of GLSU. Once consultants use and understand GLSU, \u201cthey will recommend it,\u201d Khatcherian says.\n\u201cMagnitude is a great company, and GLSU is a great tool. It\u2019s already developed, it\u2019s proven, and it makes a good impression \u2013 ensuring maximum customer satisfaction at minimum effort for the consultant.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nAn American icon, Fender was founded in Southern California and has established a worldwide influence that extends from the studio to the stage \u2013 and beyond. Everyone from beginners to the world\u2019s most acclaimed artists have used Fender instruments, amps and gear, making the company not only a revered industry leader but a cultural symbol that resonates globally.\nNearly seven decades since founder Leo Fender built his first electric guitar, Fender\u2019s reach transcends instruments and accessories, encompassing a range of innovative digital experiences that fuel musical expression and serve players at every stage \u2013 on every stage.\nChallenges\nFender\u2019s accounting department faced a serious payroll interface problem on their weekly upload from their payroll service to SAP. Duplicate entries were creating error messages that needed correcting before upload to SAP \u2013 consuming valuable time that could be better spent on more productive accounting activities.\nSolution\nFamiliar with Process Runner GLSU from a previous engagement, an IT Analyst hired to correct the payroll interface problem recommended Process Runner GLSU as the best solution. He suggested it would not only fix the payroll problems, but also provide other valuable functionality. After seeing a demonstration of the product, Fender\u2019s Accounting Manager was convinced.\u00a0\u201cI knew we would make great use of Process Runner GLSU.\u201d\nProcess Runner GLSU quickly proved to be a winning solution. Process Runner GLSU\u2019s competitive pricing and off-the-shelf convenience far exceeded any potential in-house solution. Deployment was fast and easy. And templates can easily be created by the user. It now takes less than 10 minutes to build a template, and templates are easy to modify and store.\nResults\n\nFlexible Functionality Pays Royalties\nAccording to Fender\u2019s Accounting Manager, \u201cwe could see Process Runner GLSU was going to be user-friendly and this allows us to use Process Runner GLSU in unusual ways.\u201d For example, Fender uses Process Runner GLSU to pay \u2018non-invoice\u2019 vendors. Their royalty artists and sales tax payments are made by uploading all payment requests to one Process Runner GLSU template, then forwarded to AP for royalty payments and GL for sales tax payments. The company eliminated manual entry on hundreds of \u2018non-invoice\u2019 vendors.\nEasier Acquisition Uploads\nAfter Fender acquired other companies, they uploaded receivable balances into their customer sub-ledger with Process Runner GLSU. When originally purchased, they had not even considered using it for this purpose. They discovered it reduced a day\u2019s work to about half an hour.\n\n\nReduces Petty Cash Reconciliation Errors\nProcess Runner GLSU also solved Fender\u2019s petty cash problem. A Process Runner GLSU template was created and forwarded to petty cash custodians who used it as they would their initial spreadsheets. The template allowed AP to avoid rekeying and correcting their errors during reconciliation.\nBusiness Benefits\nFewer data entries and less re-posting means time saved in every area of accounting. Specifically, the new Process Runner GLSU payroll interface delivered great time savings and fewer errors on entries over 1000 lines. Similarly, for cash postings, the prior day\u2019s banking is downloaded from the bank into an Excel-compatible spreadsheet. Using macros, the information is transferred into a Process Runner GLSU template, reducing input time from two hours to 20 minutes.\n\n"

        "content": "\n\nDatalogic is a global technology leader in the automatic data capture and process automation markets, specialized in the designing and production of bar code readers, mobile computers, sensors for detection, measurement and safety, vision and laser marking systems. Closeness and timely response to every customer requirement, together with continuous innovation and high-quality offering, are the distinctive elements at the base of Datalogic success for over 40 years. Its cutting-edge solutions help to increase the efficiency and quality of processes in the Retail, Manufacturing, Transportation and Logistics and Healthcare industries, along the entire value chain.\nDatalogic can boast 45 years of history and has grown constantly over the years, thanks to the dedication with which customer needs have always been at the heart of the quality of its products and to the considerable investments in Research & Development, supported by a management capable of looking to the future. Today, Datalogic Group employs approximately 2,900 staff worldwide and is headquartered in Bologna, Italy.\nChallenges\nDatalogic implemented a CO-PA (Profitability Analysis) application in SAP so they could better analyze the profitability of segments of their markets, structured according to products, customers, orders, and organizational units such as company codes or business areas. During implementation they discovered that if they wanted customer and document reference details, they had to enter them manually at the line-item level \u2013 a prohibitive task. They were further hindered by the 1000 line-item limit in SAP. Datalogic\u2019s IT Project Manager had two options. \u201cWe explored the idea of developing a custom program with a user interface to upload worksheets to SAP, but found out it would not be very flexible.\u201d The other option was to purchase off-the-shelf software. That\u2019s when they began to explore Magnitude Process Runner GLSU.\nSolution\nAfter evaluating the software, Datalogic purchased GLSU for FI postings related to cost and profitability reporting. \u201cOne of our consultants had worked with GLSU at another company,\u201d their IT Project Manager recalls. \u201cAfter he showed it to us, we felt that GLSU made more sense than creating our own program. With GLSU, we don\u2019t have to maintain the software, and it gives us better flexibility and more options.\u201d According to Datalogic, their FI documents were traditionally very difficult to track. \u201cWhen making a journal entry or memo, you can choose not to capture the detail. So the reporting is always a \u2018black box.\u2019 No one knew before what went into an FI transaction. Now, when we want to include details for FI transactions, we can do it, because we have the right tool to do it. It\u2019s easy to associate the FI level of detail with the sales data. With that association possible, we can know the specifics of a service contract entered in the SD module,\u201d for example.\nResults\nPreviously Datalogic could not enter 1000 line-items in an FI document. Now with GLSU, they have a new set of expectations and possibilities. \u201cWe\u2019ve achieved a new level of detail in the reporting that we simply didn\u2019t have earlier.\u201d\nFewer Errors\n\u201cThe user interface in GLSU is a big advantage. Thanks to the pre-validation within GLSU, errors and inconsistencies are easily flagged and handled before posting to SAP.\u201d\nIncreased Productivity\nGLSU can support a large number of line items, limited only by the version of Excel, without a corresponding increase in workload. \u201cWe can get better productivity without increasing overhead. It just makes sense to use GLSU whenever you have a large number of line items to post.\u201d\nImproved Flexibility\nWith GLSU, making entries is simple and fast and gives Datalogic greater flexibility.\nBusiness Benefits\nGLSU lets users post profitability items across any characteristics included in CO-PA. Datalogic now enjoys end-to-end profitability analysis at the production level. Their IT Project Manager notes, \u201cwe\u2019ve never had that kind of reporting before. GLSU enables that.\u201d The new level of detail in their profitability report is \u201ca big business benefit.\u201d\u201cIt enables better analytics and decision making. We can post transactions with more detail and insight \u2013 a big plus for us.\u201dThey are just beginning to understand the tool\u2019s potential.\u201cGLSU has increased our expectations about what is possible. We continue to find more uses for it as we learn more, especially when we have a lot of postings to do.\u201d\nImproved business automation and loading other types of FI documents are next on the agenda.\n\u201cThe moment we saw GLSU for the first time, we were convinced it was going to work well for us. It has certainly lived up to our expectations.\u201d\n\n"

        "content": "\n\nPower Equipment Company is an American success story. In 1948 two young entrepreneurs including first employee, Dave Olson, who still runs the business today, recognized the superior technology of McCulloch chain saws when they were introduced. They saw the market potential and obtained distribution rights to take the superior line of products to market.\nIn 2012 Power Equipment Company decided to purchase SAP to run their business which employed just over 25 people. Like others who implement SAP\u2019s ERP there was a big change in processes to manage the business. As business grew and sales order volume continued to increase the team was stretched to keep up with the volume of transactions and the data routines involved in sales, operations, finance, inventory and many other parts of the operation. Power Equipment had to hire outside consulting and development to help to keep up with the workload and help manage complex data operations.\nChallenges\nThe growing wholesale distribution company was struggling to manually load and update data in SAP, with complex routines, and a heavy reliance on outside consultants. The company needed a tool to streamline data management that was also easy for any business user to manage.\nHolly Bierer, an entrepreneurial IT Company executive with Power Equipment, kept asking herself, is there a way for a smaller team to do more with fewer people and time involved? She faced this dilemma head on.\nHolly needed a way to load data quickly and in mass. In a typical month the company was processing over 3500 sales orders, and more than 2600 purchase orders. In addition, their business required volumes of product information be updated frequently. To keep pace with those updates, each month she added about 500 new material masters.\nIn addition to their ongoing data needs, there were several data cleansing projects. As SAP-experienced resources were challenging to find, Holly needed a tool that didn\u2019t require SAP expertise to run. If she could reduce time required for repetitive tasks, she would free up team members for more important, strategic needs.\nSolution\nFrom Reactive to Proactive Data Management\nMagnitude Process Runner enabled Power Equipment Company to manage data faster \u2013 directly via business users.\nTo reduce manual operation and dependencies on outside resources, and to harness the growth of their operations, Holly looked for a solution that could help her team manage SAP data a whole new way.\nHolly\u2019s primary goal was to increase productivity. She also wanted to improve processes and the accuracy of the data. She knew that if data improved, so would the value of the data.\nShe researched the known available options in the market. LSWM from SAP was an option, but it took special skills to use and had limitations with scenarios she ran frequently. It would require more consultants, and that was not an option. She also looked at several data management tools.\nWhen Holly downloaded the free trial of Process Runner she realized anyone in her company could use it. Process Runner didn\u2019t require skills beyond the ability to use Microsoft Excel.\nThe choice was simple: Process Runner.\nThe Answer was Process Runner\nProcess Runner was well suited for a non-technical workforce. Holly\u2019s teams could leverage Excel familiarity to automate data. She liked the ready-to-run templates on the Process Runner Cloud. It gave her a road map for automation. Process Runner delivered all SAP technologies in one tool, which no other vendor did. This allowed more comprehensive automation without buying multiple tools. Overall, Process Runner delivered the broadest coverage for business process automation.\nAnother factor in Holly\u2019s decision was Magnitude\u2019s support team, whom she found highly useful when she had questions during her product trial. She knew this would important over the life over the use of Process Runner.\nProcess Runner was an ideal fit because it was built for business users. Flexibility in licensing meant she could make implementation more affordable. As she considered future need such as workflow management, Process Runner stood out from competition.\nSoon after purchase her team got to work with Process Runner. From onboarding of new products and creating many materials to adding suppliers, pricing updates, to schedule creating schedules, loading stocks, Process Runner quickly went to work processing data for Power Equipment.\nPrimary business drivers for change:\n\nIncrease accuracy of the data and overall process\nDecrease effective hours to manage data\nSpeed time to market by minimizing manual data input\nAddress anticipated ecommerce needs\nSimplify product information system updates\nEnable internal teams to do their own work without third parties\nSecure an adaptable tool for changing business needs\n\nResults\nIt was not long before the tool paid for itself. Six months and Process Runner had paid back the initial investment.\nAt one time, Power Equipment uploaded 900 sales orders. It took 10 minutes to create the script and 45 to 50 minutes to run Process Runner. This job alone saved the company 45 hours of manpower.\nProcess Runner has also allowed Holly\u2019s team to take on new projects with quicker time to results. Users have become confident in their ability to get work done. It\u2019s also improved the quality and the value of the data that goes into production.\nHolly said simulating the processes in advance is highly valuable to creating new solutions for their needs. Holly believes that one big factor in their success with Process Runner has been the number of areas that they have improved processes including:\n\nSupplier Data Management\nCustomer Data Creation\nMaster Data Creation and Management\nChanges to Materials\nTransform Data\nRoll back with Mass Data Changes\n\nThe results have included some major improvements in the performance of the business including:\n\nLower IT Reliance to assist with data\nLower Total Cost of Ownership of SAP\nImproved Time to Market for Products to Customers\nImproved Data Quality and Data Value\n\nToday they are a more agile, flexible organization whose users love the autonomy Process Runner enables. Getting work done faster with higher quality has helped Power Equipment achieve its goals.\n"

Denny Lee, responsible for data sciences engineering, has an ambitious mission: to seek order in the petabytes of expense-related data collected by Concur\u2019s 20,000+ customers around the world.\nRequirements\n\nAccelerated Hadoop data-processing engine\nAdvanced BI analytics and visualization capabilities\nSQL connectivity\n\nThe Toolkit\n\nApache Spark\nSAP Lumira\nMagnitude Simba Spark Driver\nMagnitude Simba Spark Extension for SAP Lumira\n\nLearning From Data and Making Customer Reporting Easier\nLee works to derive actionable insight from the biggest of Big Data. His task is twofold: Learn from the data so Concur can deliver better services to its 20,000+ customers worldwide, and establish machine-learning algorithms to operate more efficiently, particularly when it comes to enabling customer fiduciary reporting capabilities. A few years ago, Lee delineated his approach and broke his analytics challenge into four thematic components: Consolidation, Visualization, Insight, and Recommendation.\nFor Lee, consolidation meant looking to Hadoop data solutions for storing, processing, and uniting Concur\u2019s petabytes of expense data. An early adopter of Apache Spark, Lee sought to leverage its data-processing power to accelerate Concur\u2019s analytics, or, in Lee\u2019s words, to make it \u201crun really fast.\u201d\nVisualization would enable Lee to find meaning in raw data, and he turned to Lumira, the data-visualization and analytics solution from Concur\u2019s parent company SAP. \u201cLumira enables us to analyze, extract, wrangle, visualize, and create stories around our data,\u201d explains Lee.\nWith application and data tools in place, Lee would be able to gain insight, and importantly, make recommendations to Concur leadership. But he needed one more thing to get his analytics engine running at high speed. And that was Simba connectivity solutions from Magnitude.\nBack up a couple of years: Before a Concur acquisition was a glimmer in SAP\u2019s eye, the Lumira team recognized the need to provide open, cross-platform connectivity to emerging data sources. After evaluating competing technologies, the SAP Analytics group chose Simba data connectors to provide Lumira connectivity to Hive, Impala, and Redshift. Simba drivers offered open connectivity to those platforms, but also SQL capabilities: Data scientists could use Lumira to get at their Hive, Impala, and Redshift data using their existing SQL expertise without having to learn a source-specific language like HiveQL.\nThe Lumira team recognized early on that Apache Spark could make efficient Big Data self-service analytics more powerful. That goal\u2014paired with escalating customer demand for accelerated Hadoop data-processing\u2014drove the Lumira team to embrace Apache Spark connectivity, and they went with a trusted partner to provide it. Paul Ekeland, SAP\u2019s Senior Director of Product Management for Big Data, cites industry leaders\u2019 adoption of Simba Spark connectivity as a factor in extending the Simba partnership.\n\u201cFor Spark, particularly, it\u2019s the presence that Simba has in the market,\u201d notes Ekeland. \u201cHaving other vendors such as Hortonworks and Databricks already using that particular driver, and Simba showing a predominant presence in a market area which is so dynamic made us confident that we could have a good partner in Simba to go along on the Spark adventure.\u201d\nThe Brave New World of Easy, Efficient Expense Reporting\nBack to Concur. With Lumira, Spark, and Simba connectivity in place, Lee took aim at data analysis, specifically expense-report classification. He started with a seemingly \u201cboring topic\u201d: corporate receipt management.\n\u201cFrom a high level, [Lumira + Spark + Simba connectivity] allows us to simplify expense-report classifcation,\u201d explains Lee. \u201cCustomer users take a picture of their receipt, we OCR it, we classify it \u2026automatically.\u201d\nLee\u2019s expense-reporting classification model has provided tangible benefits \u2013 both to Concur and to Concur customers. \u201cExpense reporting is easier for the user,\u201d continues Lee, \u201cand [the accuracy the capability delivers] actually improves the tax implications for the customer company.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next? Giving back to the broader Apache Spark community. Lee heads the Seattle, Washington Apache Spark Meetup, and SAP\u2019s Ekeland is committed to making the most of the Lumira team\u2019s experience.\n\u201cSpark offers a lot of hope,\u201d concludes Ekeland. \u201cAt SAP, we are investing from an analytical-tool perspective and a data-source perspective where we see opportunities to improve Spark itself.\u201d\n\n"

        "content": "\nIn Brief\n\nBefore Angles, ForgeRock had no success with complex native reporting tools\nAngles was the clear choice, an intuitive, cloud-based offering loaded with pre-built content\nImplementation was quick and easy, and Bennett\u2019s team was generating reports in days\nAngles shaved 2 days off ForgeRock\u2019s month-end close process\nBennett\u2019s team saved hundreds of hours on SOX compliance tasks\n\nForgeRock, Inc., is a multinational identity and access management (IAM) software company focusing on the customer and workforce experience. The company is public, and headquartered in San Francisco, California, with offices around the world.\nIn today\u2019s digital ecosystem, everyone and everything has a digital identity which allows systems, services, and apps to know who they are interacting with. ForgeRock is a dynamic, comprehensive digital identity platform designed to provide no compromise security, privacy, and compliance, and to support exceptional experiences.\nUsing ForgeRock, more than a thousand enterprise customers orchestrate, manage, and secure the complete lifecycle of identities, in either their customers or workforce, or both.\nNative Reporting Tools Weren\u2019t Cutting It \nBefore implementing Angles for NetSuite this year, ForgeRock faced slow, complex reporting processes that weighed down its finance and transactional teams. The problems chiefly involved revenue and financial reporting. At fault was the practice of downloading multiple reports then manually recompiling them in Excel. Michael Bennett, Accounting Projects & Systems Director at ForgeRock, needed a system to streamline reporting and boost his team\u2019s productivity.\nNetSuite has a broad set of native reporting tools, which Bennet\u2019s team tried to use. But they quickly found that without technical knowledge they could not autonomously generate anything more complex than base-level reports. Attempting to create tax, treasury, and revenue reports were dragging down productivity.\n\u201cSo, with our revenue reporting with NetSuite, what we had to do was download multiple reports, maybe four or five reports, and then recompile those into an Excel database, which is obviously very manual and time-consuming\u2026it ultimately did not meet our needs,\u201d he said of NetSuite. \u201cA barrier to entry with native NetSuite reporting tools was the steep early learning curve to build reports.\u201d\nOn top of that, ForgeRock was a newly public company, so the team were also wrangling with new SOX compliance processes.\nBennett and his team were ready to trade in these complexities for ease of use. Some solutions he researched promised a year of preparation and building, as well as a heavy lean on IT to get them up and running. He needed something that would let his team hit the ground running.\nAngles Stood Out From the Crowd\nCreating reports at ForgeRock was time-consuming and tedious and Bennett saw much room for improvement in those processes. At the time they used Anaplan for reporting and budgeting on NetSuite ERP data. They had other solutions for SOX controls and expense claims. This multi-system approach worked but was not ideal.\nHe wanted a tool to accompany his ERP that was:\n\nCloud-based\nEasy to implement\nLoaded with pre-built content to hit the ground running\nSimple to use to get users engaged from the get-go\n\nHe had used GL Wands successfully at a previous company and trusted that insightsoftware would deliver again. Bennett hoped that, due to its ease of use, Angles for NetSuite could solve his revenue reporting issues. The fact that it was cloud-based was another huge plus. They wanted a solution to deliver better financial reporting as well as tie together what was working for them with NetSuite.\n\u201cMy experience across multiple industries is you have an ERP that is transacting and then you need a reporting tool that sits on top of that to give you access to real-time data, data at the lowest level. What we were looking for in a new solution was, number one, for it to be cloud-based, and number two, ease of use.\u201d\nAngles for NetSuite was all that and more to Bennett.\nSeamless Implementation\nWhen Angles for NetSuite came to the market, Bennett brought it in to fix ForgeRock\u2019s reporting woes.\u00a0\n\u201cWith Angles, it was a very fluid and interactive experience to get it all up and running,\u201d said Bennet. \u201cWe had certain ideas and certain needs that were taken on board by the product team, and they built reports specifically for us, which are now embedded in the product offering for general release.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile longer-term employees have been slower to adopt Angles, ForgeRock has seen great uptake from eager new employees. He says the laggards are gradually joining the ranks of his new Angles users. The ease of implementation, preloaded reports, and out-of-the-box readiness is proving too good to resist.\u00a0\n\u201cThey [new employees] get it, so we\u2019re getting new licenses, more and more new licenses for Angles\u2026It\u2019s difficult to force people to use something new, so I think it\u2019s easier for them to see their colleagues using it, saving time, working smarter.\u201d\u00a0\nResults Came Thick and Fast\nAs companies strive to stay nimble in modern markets, supply chains, and industries, streamlining processes and spending are must-haves. Angles for NetSuite delivered many key wins for ForgeRock, including:\nOut-of-the-box Readiness \nBennett found that Angles was ready to go with a comprehensive library of extensible, interactive business views. His team loved the pre-built content packs, including interactive reports, visualizations, and dashboards. They were up and running immediately, with no lag for installation, combining ERP data with other sources to view the bigger picture.\n\u201cWe evaluated Tableau\u2026and it was going to take up to a year wait to work with IT to build new reports in Tableau. Whereas we\u2019ve already hit the ground running with Angles. The beauty of Angles, is it comes preloaded with predefined reports for us, based on our needs.\u201d\nVisibility of Up-to-date Data\nAs ForgeRock developed its place in the software market, its financial reporting needs increased. While NetSuite managed well enough, Bennett wanted more insight into how the company was doing and its relationship with vendors.\nAngles for NetSuite provides ForgeRock the fine-tuned reporting it needs. It ensures Bennett has a reporting tool that provides access to real-time data. In addition to generating proper tax, treasury, and revenue reports, Angles supplies the intercompany matrix in a summary format that his team needed but was not receiving with NetSuite.\n\u201cWe now have a vendor trend report, which is pretty powerful,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cAnd then we have our treasury reports, which are also powerful. But the most important one for us is the revenue reports all being available in one place\u2026. for me personally each month I look at the vendor trend which very quickly and easily shows me the activity for the previous month or another data date range if needed.\u201d\nEase of Use \nForgeRock teams don\u2019t rely on IT to build reports anymore. With Angles they can self serve their own financial reports, saving valuable time and allowing them to zero in on the data they need to share and analyze. Angles allows them to present operational data in a way anyone can understand. With drag-and-drop editing, rich visualizations and intuitive interactivity, ForgeRock staff can refresh their reports at any time to get fast answers to their business-critical questions.\n\u201cThe fact that it comes preloaded with reports out the door, it\u2019s a fantastic option. It is similar in look and feel to Tableau, but it is much easier to set up,\u201d Bennett said.\nAutomated Reporting Processes\nThe ForgeRock finance team are spending less time on reports and using that time for more valuable tasks that drive revenue. They love the ability to drill down into the details of any report, from summary to transaction level, to find and fix issues quickly. Angles puts them in control of operational reporting because it understands their ERP and connects directly to source data. Now Bennett\u2019s team spends more time analyzing data rather than just compiling it, supplying up-to-date information for informed decisions. Angles shaved two days off ForgeRock\u2019s month-end close process and that benefit has not escaped Bennett.\n\u201cIt has saved a lot of time and manual effort. It allows the teams to really focus on the value adds,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cAll those hours that we spent manually recompiling data have now been saved.\u201d\nSOX Compliance \nAs a public company, Angles for NetSuite drives ForgeRock\u2019s SOX compliance. Many in the company were new to the process, but Angles has delivered a readily usable and scalable method of analyzing and achieving goals within SOX tasks. Since Angles shaves a few hours off each task, it easily saves hundreds of team hours every month.\n\u201cAs a newly public company, Angles has helped tremendously with our SOX compliance effort. For most people in the company, it is our first time dealing with SOX. We have hundreds of SOX processes and controls, and we are utilizing Angles extensively to close out those tasks each month,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cWithout Angles it would take a few extra hours for each task because you\u2019ve got to go through different screens in NetSuite find, let\u2019s say, a PO (purchase order) and you have a match the invoice and the bill. Whereas by using certain angles reports, you can see everything in one screen.\u201d\nReal-time insights help ForgeRock navigate the future \nWith Angles for NetSuite, ForgeRock now has complete control over its data. Reduced manual data processes mean Bennett\u2019s team is happier and more productive. He expects his use of Angles will expand over time and he hopes more users will adopt it as they see others prospering from the value it provides.\n"

        "content": "\n\nKimball Office is a US company headquartered in Jasper, Indiana. Kimball Office is a design driven, technologically savvy brand, tailoring solutions that provide better workplace, learning and healing environments for over 50 years. With Kimball\u2019s organic growth and acquisitions such as Nash, their product mix has increased dramatically. In 2003, when Kimball rolled out SAP, they adapted several methods to update SAP data using, for instance, CATT and Custom Transactions. Very quickly, however, the SAP users and \u2013 more pressingly \u2013 the data management teams found that the volume and complexity of the updates were slowing their time to market; it was difficult to get data ready to be used.\nWhile workload increased, some of the most time-intensive changes fell on shoulders of a team led by Don Neu, director of IT at Kimball Office. At that same time, due to growth in other areas of the company, some SAP data team members were moving to other positions, and the data team was reduced while the workload remained constant.\nChallenges\nThe super-users in marketing, material management, supply chain, and data management were responsible for supporting operations by managing massive amounts of data for SAP business processes within tight time constraints. Spreadsheets were maintained and initiated by business teams within Kimball to manage simple and complex tasks. For example, Bill of Material, Material Master, pricing, and financials were collected in spreadsheets. Timely delivery was a challenge due to the manual process. The process of preparing, formatting, checking, and transforming spreadsheets previous to loading data into SAP was exasperating and unwelcomed.\nHow hard was it? Over 90 per cent of Kimball\u2019s products require a reassignment of classes and attributes since Kimball has highly configurable product inventory. The team used CATT to perform class reassignments, a manual and challenging copy file. They also created material classifications of over 100,000 of models. Every model has between one and two dozen characteristics, adding complexity which Magnitude Process Runner helped automate and manage. Additionally, Process Runner helped Kimball produce an electronic catalog for the furniture industry, which required significant data propagation using classifications. Typically, they produced one electronic catalog each month.\nSolution\nAccording to Don Neu, after implementing Process Runner they have benefitted in a number of ways: \u201cIf Magnitude went away we\u2019d have to really rethink what we\u2019re doing and retool our processes.\u201d\nOne critical result is that now Kimball has the ability to review and test data before loading \u2013 a unique capability of Process Runner. Kimball users can now debug data issues before data is loaded to SAP, which saves significant time. Process Runner has become a vital part of business as it keeps up with the speed Don and his team need. Previously the team would spend numerous hours fixing and analyzing the data in hopes of getting it right.\nOne other tremendous benefit is the ability to use all spreadsheets from their existing processes. Change management has been a breeze.\nNow, Process Runner can handle any job no matter how big or small, making life very convenient. To Kimball\u2019s surprise there were some unexpected benefits that came with using Process Runner too. For example, in CLMM transaction, a class would be assigned if it was not there, and churns can also be maintained.\nAccording to the team, they have \u201cno way to make big mistakes\u201d with Process Runner, as the built-in data validation prevents those bigger mistakes from occurring.\nResults\nFast forward to the present and operations are uneventful when it comes to managing data. End users look forward to handing over their spreadsheets to the data team, and in relatively short time they can see data loaded in SAP with highest quality. A task that used to take hours or days is now completed in minutes. Process Runner will automatically assign the class if it is unassigned, as well as set the value. Extremely large worksheets can be easily generated in 15 to 20 minutes.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done tens of thousands of updates in no time at all\u201d according to Don. Being able to seamlessly maintain, churn and move the content of the build assembly to kits made a big impact. Time to market has improved too. This means real dollars to a business like Kimball Office.\nFor instance, a chain of three separate processes are linked and run automatically in order, providing over 130,000 updates. This \u201cjob\u201d runs in nine hours and is scheduled overnight. Kimball\u2019s data team even chained 12 processes into a single process in one instance to perform the complete set of Material Maintenance steps.\n\u201cTruly work is being done for us overnight while we are resting,\u201d remarked Don Neu. Remote scheduling of these updates is as easy as running my update, while sitting in my chair watching a ball game. Literally!\u201d\nLooking Ahead\nKimball would like to add more automation for their users. Process Runner\u2019s Excel-Add In is just the ticket. Don and Senior Product Data Manager, Cory Layman, and others are looking at how to automate pricing coordination and resets, accounting and more. Process Runner\u2019s financial automation is highly regarded in the SAP industry, and Kimball can make good use of this award winning capability.\n"

It is the largest private label soup manufacturer in the United States.\nChallenges\n\nThe Plan For Growth\nAs Morgan Foods International (MFI) prepared for an ambitious goal to grow their business rapidly over the next three years, they understood that their enterprise architecture, including their instance of SAP ECC which had changed little since it was implemented 17 years earlier, would need to be revitalized.\nThe team decided to begin by addressing business processes that had not been properly implemented in SAP to support the growth plans. The multi-prong plan focused on improving product lifecycle management (by implementing SAP PLM), modernizing their approach to logistics, and what Steve Hankins, CFO at Morgan foods describes as a \u201cplant floor remediation project.\u201d\nMFI dedicated time and resources to reformulating a few key business processes. They rewrote all of their Radio Frequency (RF) transactions and retrofit their warehouse facilities to implement the proper stock transfer procedures that would enable their business logistics processes to support the multi-facility operation they had become. The plant floor remediation project entailed reworking all of the company\u2019s Production Supply Areas (PSAs), all of the resource definitions, and rewriting every recipe manufactured in their facilities.\nHankins reflects, \u201cwe were kind of working both ends toward the middle, and, in the middle, was a combination of our business forecasting processes and our production planning processes.\u201d MFI needed a better way to plan the annual operating plan and manage those details all the way through execution. They investigated a few software products to help them achieve this and decided that the ideal solution for them would be a combination of SAP\u2019s Integrated Business Planning and Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling (PP/DS) product. This solution would allow them to determine the resources and dates/times for carrying out operations, while taking resource and product availability into consideration. However, implementing PP/DS would require an ERP upgrade to SAP S/4HANA.\nThe Big Move To S/4HANA\nWhen S/4HANA was released by SAP in 2015, it represented a major shift from the company\u2019s R/3 product because it took advantage of the company\u2019s new in-memory database HANA. Since its release, adoption of the S/4HANA platform had been slow \u2013 driven, in part by fears regarding the complexity and cost associated with upgrades.\nMFI undertook a study of their existing architecture to determine the level of difficulty that a migration would entail, because, as Hankins points out, the golden rule for upgrading any software is \u201cdon\u2019t break the business.\u201d Ultimately, the MFI team determined that the opportunities afforded by migrating to S/4HANA, particularly the access it provided to PP/DS, outweighed the risks and they decided to move forward with the migration process.\nAccording to Hankins, MFI\u2019s migration to S/4HANA went so smoothly that he compared it to a \u201cglorified upgrade.\u201d He partially credits the work that MFI undertook in advance to upgrade business processes as one of the keys to the success of the migration. The other factor that impacted the ease of MFI\u2019s upgrade was the fact that their instance of SAP contained very few customizations.\n\nSolution\n\nIn order to help tame the complexity of SAP and provide insights to business users Morgan Foods implemented Magnitude Angles for SAP (previously Every Angle) in 2003. With a small IT team \u2013 outsourcing much of the IT management and hardware infrastructure necessary for the S/4HANA upgrade to a private cloud vendor \u2013 MFI needed to access financial and operational reports. Every Angle provided the food manufacturer with actionable insights about their business without overburdening the IT staff.\n\u201cAlthough SAP contains a wealth of information,\u201d explains Hankins, \u201cyou can\u2019t easily get information out in a report format. [Angles for SAP] creates an abstraction layer that Morgan Foods has made extensive use of over the years, and is embedded in the way we do things today.\u201d\nAs part of the preparation to move to S/4HANA, the team at MFI worked with consultants from Magnitude to perform a Health Check on their existing SAP instance in order to determine how they could ensure that the data they migrated was as clean, accurate, and up-to-date as possible. The process included creating Angles, or views into SAP data, to review areas that might contain inaccurate, duplicative, or incomplete data within three major areas: Material Master, Vendor Master, and Customer Master. The Angles, created directly within the Angles for SAP interface, reviewed master data within each area and displayed the results \u2013 along with data fields that were incorrect, missing key information or terms, or contained values that needed to be removed, such as discontinued items that had not been deleted from SAP. The dashboards enabled the MFI team to clean up the data they planned to migrate to S/4HANA, and the dashboards remain available to the MFI even after the upgrade. \u201cIt\u2019s a value-add that we would recommend to companies looking to upgrade to S/4HANA. It\u2019s something that we would maintain regularly \u2013 even without the upgrade, said Christy Roberts, Finance Manager at Morgan Foods.\nS/4HANA and Angles for SAP\n\nOne of the many benefits available to companies that implement S/4HANA is more advanced access to reporting and analytics, including the ability to process larger data sets and offer business users easier access data stored within the SAP ERP. MFI does take advantage of the Fiori interface and pre-configured Fiori widgets that offer more advanced embedded analytics. However, Hankins reveals most users still use the SAP GUI and Angles reporting tools over the Fiori interface \u2013 due, in large part, to their comfort level over years of use compared to the new interface.\n\u201cUnderpinning each Fiori widget is a CDS view, which is not dissimilar to the abstraction layer that Angles provides,\u201d says Hankins. \u201cIf a CDS view exists that matches your immediate need, then you\u2019re probably good to go. Otherwise, you have to create a CDS view to fit .\u201d\nRoberts adds that the reporting capabilities in S/4HANA are limited by the current availability of CDS views. \u201cIt takes time to get the information you need in a report format. Right now, it\u2019s not as much of an out of the box solution as Angles, with the ability to pull reports automatically and enhance report data with additional fields and parameters.\u201d\nBoth Hankins and Roberts agreed that S/4HANA offers tremendous opportunities, however, the easy-to-use interface and reporting capabilities of Angles provides an even deeper level of rich SAP data accessible on S/4HANA. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of business processes built around Angles,\u201d Hankins said. \u201cBecause of that, we never considered implementing S/4HANA without Angles. Our upgrade simply would not have been as successful without it.\u201d\nAngles for SAP, Certified for Integration with HANA databases by SAP, can enhance your S/4HANA ecosystem with SAP simplification, built-in intelligence, execution of HANA views in the Angles GUI. HANA may provide data faster, but it doesn\u2019t make it any smarter. That\u2019s where Angles for SAP comes in.\n"

HELLA develops and manufactures lighting technology and electronic products for the automobile industry and has one of the largest retail organizations for vehicle parts and accessories in Europe. The company also has one of the largest aftermarket organizations in Europe for automotive parts and accessories. HELLA has its own sales companies and partners in more than 100 countries.\nChallenges\n\nHELLA management was looking for answers to questions such as:\n\nCan we measure warehouse performance on decentralized levels?\nDo we achieve Clean Every Day?\nAre we increasing efficiency in our warehouses?\nHow can we motivate decentralized warehouses to perform better?\n\nSolution\nThe aftermarket division of HELLA has sales companies all over the world to stay close to their market and customers. In the automotive spare parts business, speed of delivery is essential. Orders have to be shipped to customers as soon as possible and, within the Netherlands, HELLA even provides same-day delivery. HELLA uses SAP WMS (Warehousing Management System) to manage its warehouses efficiently. HELLA added Magnitude Angles for SAP to its SAP BI landscape that already included SAP Business Warehouse (BW). SAP BW takes care of strategic reporting and \u2013 since Angles for SAP is not a replacement for SAP BW, but an additional analytical tool for SAP \u2013 the Angles for SAP software was added to SAP for daily analytics and operational improvements.\nHELLA\u2019s SAP landscape is complex, which makes it a challenge to retrieve data from the system for daily operational activities. Angles for SAP links data across all business processes, enabling users to quickly see the status of their orders, which is critical to HELLA, as speed of delivery is one of the company\u2019s most important and unique selling points.\nWarehouse Improvement Project\nDuring a Proof of Concept, Angles for SAP was able to demonstrate its power \u2013 including how easily it connected to SAP. HELLA started the warehouse improvement project to improve logistics for every warehouse and for every sales and marketing company in the HELLA group. HELLA implemented Pick by Voice in the warehouse to deliver goods to customers faster. The organization also reorganized the warehouse for logic picking of orders. The ultimate goal was \u201cClean Every Day\u201d: goods come in, are put away; orders come in, orders are picked and are shipped the same day. HELLA uses Angles for SAP on a daily basis to monitor and prove whether the different divisions achieve these warehousing goals.\nResults\nCentralized control over warehouse performance\nIn the past, the centralized head office calculated the warehouse performance of each individual sales company. Since using Angles for SAP, HELLA has transferred the responsibility of checking its own warehouse performance to the individual sales company. By having this control, the sales companies are able to see their own performance and if not satisfactory, they can take immediate action to correct it.\nStandardization\nHELLA has created Angles that can be used by every sales company, ensuring that the information in SAP is uniform. One set of Angles can be used on 15 different SAP systems across 15 different countries.\nAchieving goals\nHELLA uses Angles for SAP to check Clean Every Day. As speed is so important in the automotive industry, business users can quickly research whether all goods received today are put away properly, and whether all orders received today are picked and shipped today. Using the proper Angles, business users can develop a plan and take corrective action, as well as the following:\n\nDelegate monitoring of warehouse performances to decentralized levels\nHave decentralized levels measure their own achievements\nHarmonize global warehouse data\nImprove master data quality\n\n\n"

Headquartered in Lincolnshire, IL, Zebra designs and sells specialty printing devices that print variable information, bar-coded labels, RFID tags, receipts, and ID cards on-demand at the point of issuance.\nChallenges\nZebra\u2019s IT team instituted Project Merlin, a global business transformation initiative designed to integrate the data from Zebra\u2019s 50 offices and legacy source systems worldwide to provide management with \u201ca single version of the truth\u201d for business operations.\nThe three-year project involved a global ERP implementation of Oracle Release 12, which was first deployed in Europe and later to North America in Feb 2012.\n\u201cAfter implementing the Oracle package, one of the first things we realized is that we\u2019d need extensive reporting capabilities to report on Oracle ERP data,\u201d said Deepak Kaul, Director of Change Management & Process Improvement at Zebra. \u201cOracle R12 does come with plenty of canned reports, but most of them are very generic.\u201d\nZebra\u2019s corporate culture relies heavily on extensive business intelligence reporting capabilities. End-users need drill-down capabilities\u2014they want to be able to download reports, have reports delivered automatically via email, and they also want the capability to push reports out to the customer base.\nIT had its hands full with user requests. According to Kaul: \u201cIt took several weeks to develop a complex view, and even after development, we would get perpetual requests to change it. For example, \u2018Hey, I want this particular field now,\u2019 or \u2018I want new columns attached to it.\u2019 It was a nightmare because there was no end to the development cycle for each and every report.\u201d\nSearching for a solution, Zebra purchased Oracle BI Applications, but found there was still a significant amount of work involved to get the solution up and running, especially with Zebra\u2019s global environment of diverse legal entities and currencies. Oracle BI Apps represented a decent starting point, but did not contain enough content for Zebra\u2019s BI reporting needs.\nAnother issue was that Zebra\u2019s business required real-time data for up-to-the-minute inventory views for shipping purposes. This capability was not available with Oracle BI Apps.\nFrom IT\u2019s perspective, they had two choices: Either build in-house, customized views to support user information, or buy another reporting tool to enhance the reporting capability within Oracle BI. The build choice presented many challenges: a huge amount of labor was required to build the views from scratch; the amount of time it would take to ultimately complete the project; and the specialized technical resources required on an ongoing basis for change management during upgrades.\nZebra\u2019s IT team decided to buy a reporting solution instead.\nSolution\n\u201cThat is how our journey started\u2014we were looking for a unique reporting solution that would fit our many requirements, including working with Oracle BI Apps, and contacted Magnitude to learn more about their solution from a technology perspective,\u201d said Kaul. \u201cWe did our due diligence and were very careful to select the right vendor. Magnitude was the best fit for our needs in the marketplace.\u201d\nZebra\u2019s IT team adopted a best practice approach to the implementation of Angles for Oracle (formerly Noetix) Angles Generator for Oracle BI, working with the Magnitude Professional Services team to thoroughly understand the solution and its technology during the process. Because of this, IT was able to implement Angles for Oracle and run reports almost instantly after implementation.\nIT showcased Angles for Oracle reporting capabilities to Zebra\u2019s end users by holding department-specific training sessions starting with those that worked in manufacturing, receivables, and on the shipping docks. After two months, 500 end users were successfully leveraging hundreds of views to build their own reports, requiring almost no additional support from IT. Typical report examples are Work in Process (WIP) requirements by locator, downtime by employee, reservations by item, and finished goods stock levels.\nResults\nMore than 500 Zebra employees are actively using the successful integration of Magnitude and Oracle technology to meet their business intelligence needs on a daily basis. More than 2,000 reports are being generated every day and Zebra expects these numbers to increase after their deployment to Asia.\n\u201cI think our reporting initiative has been very successful, and the main reason for its success is because our users are self-sufficient,\u201d said Kaul. \u201cThe users have as many reporting needs as ever, but they don\u2019t call us as often. They are able to get the data they need for their departments on their own.\u201d\n"

However, over time, it had accumulated a tremendous volume of reports using the same data sources, with more than 1000 active users from different locations around the world. These active users produce tens of thousands of report runs each month.\nWhile a majority of these were casual, once-per-month users, Qualcomm estimated that at least 800 were heavy, daily users, whose jobs were critically dependent on the reporting systems to deliver real-time transactional information.\nThe company\u2019s Supply Chain, Business Operations and Finance departments had in excess of 3,400 unique reports, which suffered from duplication issues. In addition, some report content had become obsolete as the company\u2019s business changed.\nFor Qualcomm, the biggest challenge was identifying a solution to streamline reporting, increase efficiencies and reduce the number of customized reports. In addition, Qualcomm sought to simplify and migrate multiple systems to one, central reporting platform.\nSolution\nQualcomm pursued a new BI strategy, which included eliminating a massive amount of report customizations and involved replacing its existing reporting platform. In evaluating several operational reporting tools on the market, Qualcomm determined that the insightsoftware solution \u2013 with global operational reporting views \u2013 would be the most effective due to rich reporting content, and the end-to-end solution set.\nThe insightsoftware search functionality identifies required content and provides visibility into the data structure and version changes. Qualcomm\u2019s prior experience with insightsoftware\u2019s standard views solution had been very positive, so the company chose to stick with insightsoftware, selecting it as the strategic reporting solution for its flexible, customizable user interface.\nResults\ninsightsoftware\u2019s solution enabled Qualcomm to achieve its goals of reducing the number of packaged reporting tools in use and establishing a single reporting portal to simplify user experience, and reduce custom reports by 90%. This streamlined environment helped to enforce one Golden Copy, ensuring all users would see the same data \u2013 a single version of the truth. Users are now able to pivot the same reports to view the information in various ways. This reduction in the number of reports is far more manageable and simplifies the upgrade process and monthly maintenance.\nFurthermore, the project helped to remove the silos across the company, allowing disparate business units to work together to achieve business goals.\nDevelopment teams across Qualcomm\u2019s businesses joined forces and established commonly accepted reporting practices and formats for templates.

They serve the construction market, the commercial, institutional, and government (CIG) market, and the industrial and utility markets. Graybar products and services support new construction, infrastructure updates, building renovation, facility maintenance, repair and operations, and original equipment manufacturing.\nChallenges\nSince SAP was implemented, Graybar faced challenges in loading large amounts of financial data into the system. They found a need to input more than 1000 line items to pay invoices electronically. Although an SAP transaction code was being used, they needed a specific format for the text files, which required creation of additional tools \u2026 but the process was slow and difficult to format. Validations were not possible and there was a line item limitation.\n\u201cOur in-house solution was cumbersome\u201c, says Kent Sorenson, Manager \u2013 Accounting, at Graybar. \u201cIf something went wrong, finding the problem meant using another transaction code. It was not user friendly. It only identified one error at a time, and we\u2019d have to post again. Our productivity was slowed down.\u201c\nSolution\nGraybar purchased Magnitude Process Runner GLSU after conducting a cost/savings analysis of manual data entry vs. Process Runner GLSU licensing and maintenance. Process Runner GLSU provided a flexible and intuitive spreadsheet interface for collecting and posting transactions to SAP, without leaving Excel. Various spreadsheet templates were created, stored on the SAP server, and distributed quickly.\nToday, Graybar uses Process Runner GLSU for payment of AP invoices, monthly journal entries, and third-party outsourcing payables (from text files). While all entries are posted by the licensed Process Runner GLSU users, other employees send in data to the centralized unit by filling out a template for posting, spreading the benefit to a wider audience.\nGraybar\u2019s expected return on investment was five years but instead, the payback took just two years, according to Sorenson. Best of all, Process Runner GLSU enhances Graybar\u2019s decision-making power and lets them react faster to changes in tough economic times.\nResults\nIncreased Speed\nProcess Runner GLSU allows users to do more data entry in less time. What took up to an hour now takes minutes to post. The time saved is now spent on analyzing and making decisions about the data. Before, users would take shortcuts such as posting summary level detail and eliminating fields to save time. Graybar posts 400 to 800 lines regularly, often numbering the thousands. This is most common at year-end, with up to 9,000 lines posted for single journal entries.\nEase of Use\nKnowledge of Excel ensures rapid familiarity with the full range of functionality in Process Runner GLSU. Master templates are set up and stored in SAP, while others are customized, as needed, in just minutes. Adding, changing or deleting fields takes seconds.\nValidation\nProcess Runner GLSU promotes data integrity through a pre-validation process that identifies the majority of errors in a pop-up box before posting, making line items easy to delete or correct.\nImproved Audit Trail\nProcess Runner GLSU gives Graybar an electronic audit trail of all text items, including associated support documentation.\n\nAccording to Sorenson,\u00a0Process Runner GLSU has improved overall productivity thanks to improved speed and accuracy of data entry. As a result, Process Runner GLSU has enhanced the company\u2019s ability to perform business analytics.\n\u201cProcess Runner GLSU has\u00a0increased our data integrity on all levels, from finance to marketing,\u201d Sorenson says. \u201cUsers have commented on the quality, volume and accuracy of the data. Business analysts within IT are advocates of Process Runner GLSU because the reporting is so thorough. Process Runner GLSU gives\u00a0better analytics\u00a0and allows our business units to focus on\u00a0improving the bottom line.\u201d\nGraybar is confident that, by utilizing Process Runner GLSU and enabling their centralized accounting processes, they will continue to meet current \u2013 and future \u2013 goals.\n"

Trinity operates in five distinct business groups: Trinity Rail Group, Trinity Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group, Inland Barge Group, Construction Products Group, and Industrial Products Group.\nChallenges\nAfter Trinity implemented Oracle Financials, initial reports were developed using standard Oracle tools by a third party. In order to provide their end-users with ad-hoc reporting capabilities, Trinity began implementing Discoverer for Oracle Applications using a small pilot team representing various Business Units.\nNot only did Discoverer require a more sophisticated technical background than the pilot team anticipated, they also realized that an array of other challenges stood before them:\n\nThe data was fragmented and stored in thousands of transaction tables\nThe information was not reflected in business terms\nAn Oracle upgrade would require a rework of reports already created\nThere was not a Discoverer help file available\n\nAfter attempting to develop custom views in Discoverer, Trinity realized that to continue with that approach would be expensive and time consuming. Following a thorough analysis, Trinity was left with four options:\n\nContinue with the rollout as planned\nPerform additional database development work\nHire additional internal report developers\nInstall a new solution to address the Discoverer issues identified by the pilot team\n\nSolution\nThe first three options would require additional time and incur increased costs. Moreover, Trinity understood that the difficulty inherent in using these solutions would result in little or no end-user adoption. After looking at several other solutions, including Oracle DBI, and benchmarking with other companies that used Oracle Financials, Trinity chose Angles for Oracle to help solve the existing problems realized with Discoverer. In addition, Angles for Oracle was able to provide more than 500 out-of-the-box reports (175 Financials-related).\nTrinity selected Angles for Oracle over other alternatives because Angles for Oracle eliminated the custom configuration and technical issues they encountered with Discoverer, as well as offering the content Trinity required \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d. The comprehensive Angles for Oracle Help File allowed non-technical users to easily navigate to the information they wanted to view, increasing user acceptance across the enterprise.\nResults\nAngles for Oracle implemented a complimentary solution that enhanced Discoverer, and enabled a much higher adoption rate and overall end-user satisfaction in reporting from Oracle. With Angles for Oracle, Trinity was able to overcome the obstacles it faced with Oracle Discoverer and provide its users with quick, easy access to their critical transactional data. End-users are now able to create their own ad hoc reports within minutes and hours compared to days. Users also have the critical report protection required during application upgrades so as not to create rework. With minimal training, users are able to customize and share reports without the use of IT resources. Trinity has trained over 100 end-users to create their own reports.\n"

        "content": "\nIn Brief\n\nJet Reports helped CHAT BOARD build its operational reporting from the ground up\nProvided greater visibility into the company\u2019s inventory and supply data\nGave CHAT BOARD easier access and a better overview of its Microsoft NAV data\n\nEstablished in 2004, CHAT BOARD\u2019s magnetic and writable glass solutions are internationally renowned as modern Danish design classics. Headquartered in Ballerup, Denmark, CHAT BOARD is proud to carry on the Scandinavian tradition of outstanding craftsmanship and timeless design. Combining function and aesthetics with uncompromising quality, each piece in the company\u2019s continually growing collection has been developed to facilitate creative dialogue in the modern workplace or domestic setting.\nStarting at Zero \nWith a diverse selection of glass presentation boards in a wide array of colors, CHAT BOARD is known worldwide for its unique and stylish products. But when Henriette J\u00f8rgensen joined the company as Chief Accountant in 2019, the business was conducting its financials manually using Excel and did not run a single operational report.\n\u201cThere was no reporting at all,\u201d J\u00f8rgensen said. \u201cThere was annual reporting each year, but no monthly operational reporting.\u201d\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, global supply chains were impacted dramatically. As a result, the business struggled to purchase and maintain inventory, especially as fuel prices continued to soar.\nWhile navigating these challenges, the business has experienced significant growth since 2019. To build its operational reporting from the ground up, manage the company\u2019s inventory, and support growth, J\u00f8rgensen knew she needed a solution.\nIntroducing Jet Reports \nThe growth CHAT BOARD enjoyed is largely attributed to its strong sales team. J\u00f8rgensen noticed they used Jet Reports to generate the department\u2019s sales reports and decided to adopt the tool for operational purposes.\n\u201cCHAT BOARD operated manually for a long time,\u201d J\u00f8rgensen said. \u201cBut when you want to expand the company, you can\u2019t run things manually because it won\u2019t allow you to have an overview of the business. Using Jet Reports allows me to work smarter, not harder.\u201d\nTo get Jet Reports up and running for the finance department, J\u00f8rgensen worked with the company\u2019s partner, Consulendo, an elite partner that works with Microsoft-related services. With Consulendo\u2019s help, CHAT BOARD was able to smoothly implement Jet Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s much better when you have an expert sitting next to you,\u201d J\u00f8rgensen said of working with the company\u2019s partner.\nJet Reports provided the business with advanced operational and financial reporting within Excel. It empowered CHAT BOARD to generate timely, accurate financial reports with its enterprise resource planning (ERP) tool, Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Jet Reports allowed the business to:\n\nPull live ERP data from Microsoft Dynamics NAV into Excel\nLeverage real-time data\nCreate easy self-serve custom reports\nReport on multiple data sources\nAutomate data prep & formatting\n\n\u201cJet Reports was the best system for our size of company and provided most value.\u201d\nResults \nBy implementing Jet Reports, CHAT BOARD enjoys better inventory management, a strong overview of reports, and easier to access data. \u201cManual work is complicated and takes a lot of time,\u201d said J\u00f8rgensen. \u201cJet Reports has given me a more specific and better overview of the reports I\u2019m using instead of extracting information from Excel. When I\u2019d manually export data, something might be missing. But with Jet Reports, nothing is missing. We have better accuracy now.\u201d\n\nJet Reports streamline\u2019s CHAT BOARD\u2019s formerly manual processes by:\nSaving five hours every month on manual reporting\nConsolidating multiple reports into one for greater efficiency\nReducing costs by gaining greater financial visibility\nNurturing a strong data culture\n\n\u00a0\nImproved Inventory Maintenance \nJet Reports helped J\u00f8rgensen build CHAT BOARD\u2019s operational reporting from square one. Whereas the company did not have any operational reporting before implementing the solution, it now uses the tool to streamline inventory during a time rife with supply chain complications. \u201cIn the past four months, I\u2019ve been keeping a close watch on supply chain. I\u2019ve been helping my CEO, who does the supply chain for our expensive purchases.\u201d\n\u201cJet Reports has helped me a lot.\u201d J\u00f8rgensen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a report to see what\u2019s in an order and bill of material. That can take a report telling me what\u2019s in stock on raw materials and how much we have in a purchase order. I can set this to six months ahead and see whether I need to make a new purchase order for these raw materials. Jet Reports has been a great help by providing us an overview of our stock.\u201d\nThe company now runs a weekly KPI and revenue report that generate automatically on the last day of every month. \u201cIt\u2019s critical for us to have so much glass of each color in stock and in different sizes,\u201d J\u00f8rgensen explained. \u201cI use Jet Reports to keep track of inventory. I put in the minimum stock we need, run the report, and see how much we have in stock for the next three months.\u201d Jet reports enables the business to ensure it has the supplies it needs in stock at all times.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been happy to use Jet Reports for purchase orders. Just looking at the ERP isn\u2019t enough. Jet Reports tells me what raw materials we need.\u201d\nGreater Overhead Visibility \nCHAT BOARD\u2019s simplified reporting gives it greater visibility into how the business operates. Jet Reports helps provide instant, simplified access to its Microsoft NAV data. \u201cThe tool has given me a better and more specific overview of the reports I\u2019m using instead of extracting information into Excel,\u201d J\u00f8rgensen said. \u201cWhen I\u2019d manually export data, something might be missing. But with Jet Reports, nothing is missing, which gives us greater accuracy.\u201d\nWith the insight the solution lends to CHAT BOARD, the company can better maintain its crucial inventory while measuring success. \u201cIt has changed the way we purchase because we have a better overview of each product categories we need to buy.\u201d\nIn addition to inventory reports, J\u00f8rgensen also runs KPI reports. They allow her to go into granular detail on different categories of boards and sales for each area where the company does business. Jet Reports allows CHAT BOARD a clearer overhead look at the company\u2019s overall health while providing the information it needs to make critical decisions. The tool also allows CHAT BOARD to automate its reporting process. \u201cThe Sales and KPI reports run by themselves. All I need to do is add information to the report when needed.\u201d\nGreater Data Confidence \nJet Reports has strengthened the data culture at CHAT BOARD. By giving them an easy and smooth way to access data in Microsoft Dynamics NAV, J\u00f8rgensen can generate the reports she needs to provide maximum benefit to the company.\n\u201cBefore Jet Reports, I had to go into the ERP to find sources to take the data from.\u201d J\u00f8rgensen said. \u201cJet Reports helps me to better communicate what I want, what I need, and what information the reports need to give me.\u201d\nLooking to the Future \nMoving forward, CHAT BOARD seeks to upgrade to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (BC), giving the company access to all the benefits of the cloud. Jet Reports will enable the business to more easily transition by:\n\nProviding report portability. Any of the company\u2019s legacy NAV reports created in Jet Reports can be immediately ported over and plugged in to BC. Because Jet was installed before migration, reporting users will be able to interact with the new BC ERP from within a familiar platform, greatly reducing CHAT BOARD\u2019s total cost of ownership.\nEliminating roadblocks of switching to the cloud. Time investment is an equally important detail to consider as the physical cost of cloud conversion. Jet will streamline the company\u2019s reporting while keeping reporting running smoothly during migration.\n\nCHAT BOARD\u2019s sleek design, high quality products, and strong sales team ushered in a prosperous period of growth. Jet Reports helps the business support its expansion while giving its finance team a better overview of the company\u2019s health and inventory. The solution empowered the company to automate its manual processes, save time, and support its goals into the future.\n"

        "content": "\nIn Brief\n\nLiberated 10% of IT team\u2019s resources\nHubble works seamlessly with Van Hessen\u2019s J.D. Edwards ERP environment\nEmpowered the finance team to generate and edit their own reports\n\nFounded in 1902, Van Hessen has evolved into one of the world\u2019s leading companies in the harvesting, processing, and distribution of natural casings and meat products. The business works closely with a huge array of worldwide slaughterhouses to secure a constant flow of raw materials to the meat industry.\nMaintaining offices and factories in over 26 countries, Van Hessen closely controls and monitors its supply chain to guarantee quality products. The Van Hessen group consistently innovates and explores new ways to maximize production efficiency for customers across the globe.\nMeeting Stringent Local and Worldwide Regulations \nWhen Wouter van Beek joined Van Hessen as IT director in December 2000, the company operated on a small, multinational scale with an IT department of three employees. In the two decades since then the business has grown exponentially.\nIn 2017, Van Hessen merged with the Saria Group. Together, the two businesses integrated the natural casings activities of Teeuwissen, a subsidiary of the Saria Group, and Van Hessen into a new division under the name of Van Hessen. Combined, they spearheaded a fully integrated worldwide value chain that safeguarded continuity and leadership in quality.\nThe IT department gradually extended to a team of 30 tasked with creating and distributing critical ad hoc reports to stakeholders across the entire global business. As the company grew, the finance department remained heavily dependent on IT to create custom queries and modify reports. Facing a growing workload, reporting duties quickly became overwhelming. Up to 10% of the IT team\u2019s resources were dedicated to finance and accounting queries.\n\u201c20 years ago, we started as a family company, then we grew and grew and grew until we were bought by a very big company that already had a division on casings,\u201d said van Beek. \u201cBecause of the company\u2019s sudden growth, we had demands that we couldn\u2019t fulfill.\u201d\nThe company was already doing business worldwide and van Beek\u2019s IT department saw a 200% increase in overall workload. Additionally, laws surrounding the quality and handling of food are complicated at a global scale, especially considering local regulations, and fulfilling consumer demand for safe, high-quality products.\n\u201cFrom a legal standpoint, you need to maintain transparency in the meat industry,\u201d van Beek said. \u201cYou need to track and trace back to where you got your supplies in the case of situations like recalls.\u201d\nWorking Seamlessly with J.D. Edwards \nvan Beek began searching for a solution that worked for his IT team while continuing to satisfy worldwide governance and regulatory requirements. Ultimately, his goal was to create a self-service portal to empower the finance department to create and edit its own reports. The business used J.D. Edwards as its ERP and required a tool that would work seamlessly with its existing software, fulfilling business needs such as:\n\nProviding self-service reporting for finance teams\nWorking seamlessly with J.D. Edwards\nHaving easy-to-use functionality\nSimplifying regulatory requirements around the world\n\nUltimately, the tools that provided the best fit were Hubble and CXO by insightsoftware. Hubble met van Hessen\u2019s specific business needs by providing easy reporting that worked hand-in-hand with the company\u2019s J.D. Edwards environment while CXO offered advanced figure analysis.\n\u201cWe needed tools that were easily configurable around J.D. Edwards so we didn\u2019t have to train everybody on data structures,\u201d said van Beek. \u201cWe looked for one that already had everything we needed built in. There aren\u2019t many tools which supply that. insightsoftware was the only one that could.\u201d\nImplementation and Training\nFrom installation to training, implementation was a breeze for Van Hessen. The business reached out to insightsoftware during the summer of 2020 and decided to place the final order in October of the same year. Once installed, the company dedicated two weeks to training and shortly after, finance teams were already generating their own reports.\n\u201cIf you understand J.D. Edwards, you can easily understand Hubble,\u201d van Beek explained. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we want because we don\u2019t have the time or the people to spend a lot of resources in training.\u201d\nResults\nCXO and Hubble helped Van Hessen to strengthen its finance department while drastically reducing IT\u2019s workload. Here\u2019s how:\n\nCXO provided live figure analysis while incorporating non-EPM data together with financial figures and providing high quality visualizations.\nHubble alleviated demand on IT by enabling Van Hessen\u2019s finance teams to run and edit their own reports.\n\nRelieving Strain on IT\nVan Hessen chose CXO and Hubble to meet its unique business needs while alleviating heavy IT workloads. \u201cBefore adopting insightsoftware, our IT department couldn\u2019t manage financial reporting for everybody by month-end close,\u201d said van Beek. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an option to do nothing about it. We needed to create an option for self-service. It was the only way for us to be able to manage this without having an IT team of 60-70 people.\u201d\nReporting with Ease \nBefore adopting insightsoftware systems, the IT department at Van Hessen struggled to meet demand for creating ad hoc reports. Now, finance teams are equipped with a simple way to meet reporting deadlines more easily in an environment they already understand.\n\u201cIf you know J.D. Edwards, it\u2019s easy to use Hubble,\u201d said van Beek. \u201cThere are a lot of predefined reports and ad hoc queries that you can use to create reports. Even if you don\u2019t know anything about the data structures of J.D. Edwards and how things are connected, you can still use these products to create all the custom reports you need.\u201d\nSupporting a Worldwide Company\nWhen the business began, Van Hessen started with a single instance of J.D. Edwards. Now, it supports 60-70 companies all operating in J.D. Edwards with 30 instances of the ERP globally. Demand continues to grow, along with ad hoc queries and reports that must be completed by month-end close.\nSince Van Hessen implemented insightsoftware, each location is able to create and maintain the reports it needs to survive and thrive. Staff quickly gained a deep understanding of Hubble because they operate in much the same way as the existing J.D. Edwards systems. Both large and small branches have the tools they need to fully manage finance departments and reporting without relying on IT.\n"

        "content": "\n\n\nABM needed a stronger data mining system and a more efficient reporting process.\nIts existing Jet Reports system had the functionality, and the team sought training with partner, Ujuzitech.\nBy upskilling in Jet Reports, ABM achieved continuous audits and automated scripting of exceptions.\nWeekly management reporting time shrunk from 16 to 4 hours.\n4 weeks of exception reporting work is now done in real time.\nWith Jet Reports, visibility and accountability have improved company wide.\n\nAssociated Battery Manufacturers (ABM) was established in 1963 by the UK-based Chloride Group to produce batteries in Kenya for several British manufacturers including Chloride, Oldham, Lucas and Dunlop. In the early 1990s, ABM became 100 percent Kenyan-owned, and one of only a few battery manufacturers in Africa. It boasts a combined workforce of more than 900 staff who produce more than 1,400,000 batteries annually. Through its subsidiaries, ABM also offers power back-up, solar PV and water heating solutions in the East African region, selling over 100MW annually.\nMapping the Industry Model\nEven though ABM has been established for more than 50 years, its business processes hadn\u2019t yet fully modernized. With few others in the commodities industry to model their business after, it found data was being created, but not being mined properly.\n\u201cFinding the expertise that could properly map our processes and help us better utilize Microsoft Dynamics NAV ERP has long been a challenge for ABM. This made things difficult for the internal audit team,\u201d said Charles Ngare, Group Head of Internal Audit at ABM.\nABM set up its internal audit team in 2017. They found there was minimal real-time reporting from other departments, and most processes were manual and didn\u2019t have a company-wide reach.\n\u201cWe realized that we had data, but there was a limitation in the kind of reports that were available because users hadn\u2019t clearly mapped out their data. This meant that the system wasn\u2019t meeting our team\u2019s needs,\u201d said Ngare.\nThis led Ngare and his team to find a better reporting process for ABM.\nLearning to Mine Data With Ujuzitech \nThankfully, ABM quickly realized that the solution was right under its nose. Its existing Jet Reports system had this capability, it just needed to learn how to use it.\n\u201cInitially Jet Reports was adopted by the finance department in 2013 to extract data from the system for management reporting. However, utilization of the tool was very low. Finance would run three reports at most, and they weren\u2019t being used or shared,\u201d said Ngare.\nIn 2018, the Internal Audit team underwent a quick and useful training session for Jet Reports with Ujuzitech and their data horizons opened. ABM\u2019s internal audit team expanded the use of Jet Reports to better mine the data and produce smarter insights both within their team, and companywide.\n\u201cWe really value and trust our partnership with Ujuzitech. Their hands-on approach to training gave our team the skills to work efficiently and autonomously.\u201d\nSmarter Internal Audit Reporting Process With Jet Reports \nArmed with their expanded Jet Reports skillset, Ngare and his team are now able to audit company data more comprehensively. By leveraging the tool\u2019s full capabilities, ABM can run:\n\nContinuous audits \u2013 an internal process that examines accounting practices, risk controls, compliance, information technology systems and business procedures on an ongoing basis.\nAutomated scripting for exceptions \u2013 an automated alert of deviations from the expected data result.\n\n\u201cJet Reports runs itself through the scripts and it\u2019s able to send us emails every time there\u2019s an exception within the ERP that goes against our control or a policy. This enables us to do continuous audits,\u201d said Ngare.\nThese audit automations are essential to a thorough internal audit process, Ngare states. \u201cThere has been a large push in the audit industry toward automation. With Jet Reports, what used to take countless hours in the audit process, can now be done efficiently in real-time\u201d\nJet Reports offers ABM fast, flexible audit reporting, so that Ngare and his team can:\n\nCut reporting time and costs. The team at ABM can now explore data and create or modify reports on their own. Jet Custom data entities provided easy granular level detail unavailable in the standard Dynamics entities.\nSingle source of truth. With complete report management, report automation, and a collaboration and publishing platform, ABM no longer faces siloed versioning and data that can\u2019t be mined.\u00a0\nTimely insights. ABM can now easily generate timely, accurate reports using the same fields and calculations the team is used to, right inside of Excel.\u00a0\u00a0\nSimple, self-service reporting. Now, when ABM employees need information, they can get it themselves, first-hand. Whether it be the audit team, finance, or management, everybody has been trained, so people can always access the right reports at the right time.\u00a0\n\nJet Reports Boosts ABM\u2019s Performance\nInstant Audit Insights Creates Accountability\n\nThe purpose of an internal audit team is to preserve the health of the company. With Jet Reports, there has been more accountability across the company.\n\u201cWe can quickly offer management insights on performance and what is happening within the business. We designed management information reports that are sent out on a daily basis, weekly basis, monthly basis,\u201d said Ngare.\nWith automated scripting for exceptions, Ngare\u2019s internal audit team can instantly identify problematic transgressions like fraud. This has led to a reduction in inventory shrinkage at ABM. Fraud used to take a month to identify in inventory or cash, but now is reported in real-time.\n\u201cJet Reports helps us identify exceptions and instantly action them. This transparency and immediacy means everyone in the company is held to a higher standard,\u201d said Ngare.\nTime-Savings Keeps the Team Lean\n\nBefore Jet Reports, Ngare had anticipated needing more people to increase audit process efficiency. But by upping its audit ante using Jet Reports scripting capabilities, Ngare\u2019s team experienced massive time-savings and can easily deliver valuable audit insights without the additional headcount.\n\u201cWeekly management reports used to take our team about 16 hours to do. When we started using Jet Reports and scripting exceptions, it now only takes our team about four hours,\u201d said Ngare.\nCompanywide Visibility With a Single Source of Truth\n\nAll data available in real time and exists in one place, creating visibility across the company. Everyone can contribute and use the data as needed. The internal audit department can efficiently collaborate with the finance department, and management has direct access to what is going on inside of the company. No more waiting for someone to return an email with the required data report.\n\u201cWe do not have to wait to ask finance about our performance, a report about the previous day is automatically sent first thing in the morning. And if you do not record your data, an executive will be calling the next day to understand why our production dropped the previous day,\u201d said Ngare.\nJet Reports also offers outside the box company communication improvements.\n\u201cOur use of Jet Reports is not limited to auditing and reporting. It has been configured to automatically send birthday wishes and cards. This has had a very positive impact on relationships with colleagues and clients,\u201d said Edwin Nyakuna, ABM Senior Internal Auditor.\n"

Founded in Sydney, Australia in 2013, Zip now has a presence in 13 international markets. Their mission is to be the first payment choice, everywhere and every day, giving consumers, merchants and businesses around the world access to transparent, flexible and interest-free credit. Disrupting the broken credit card model, Zip puts the financial well-being of its customers and merchants at the centre of its business model. More than 55,000 retailers around the world offer Zip as a payment choice to their 8 million and growing active customers globally.\nZip Needed Greater Efficiency from its Data \nIn 2018, Christina Temme, director of Group Financial Control at Zip came into her role as a maternity leave cover, having worked previously with the CFO. \u201cIt\u2019s delightfully manic. We don\u2019t run, we sprint at Zip,\u201d Temme said. With Temme on board and the BPNL industry rapidly growing, Zip was on the hunt for acquisitions.\n\u201cOur first international move was to open a small office in New Zealand. We weren\u2019t bothered with multi-currency consolidation and were just converting AU and NZ Dollars in a 1:1 ratio. But as we grew it was clear this approach was not sustainable, and we bought Calumo on board to look at it in more detail.\u201d\nZip\u2019s data needs changed as it grew at lightning speed, and it needed more than Xero accounting software to align its data streams. \u201cWhat we needed it to do, and how we needed it to operate, changed as we move forward. Little things, like having the metadata there and being able to define it. At one point it was valid, but then it may not be anymore. But it doesn\u2019t mean that you can remove it.\u201d\nAfter Testing the Pilot,\u202fZip\u202fwas Confident Calumo was the Right Solution\u202f \nIn 2018,\u202fZip\u202fwas shopping\u202ffor the right reporting tool for its needs.\u202fThe solution needed to:\n\nConnect many Xero instances and potentially other financial systems globally.\nEnable\u202fmulticurrency consolidation.\nMake responding to ad hoc reporting requests quick and easy.\n\nSince the implementation of Calumo in 2018, Zip has grown like wildfire. It now has 30 Xero instances connected through Calumo. As Zip continues to grow, the month-end close process for Group Financial Control is constantly evolving. Using Calumo to enable quick and easy multicurrency consolidation and ad-hoc reporting has been essential to Zip\u2019s success.\n\u201cI am a very heavy user, but I\u2019m a big adopter as well. Through Calumo I have a great understanding of how it all hangs together in the back-end from an overarching financial perspective,\u201d said Temme.\nCalumo Consultants Set Zip Up for Early Success\nTemme has been involved in a lot of the subsequent build, mapping it out and working with insightsoftware and one of their specialist Calumo Partners to understand how the solution works in the back-end and how it can be adapted to changing business conditions, challenges and opportunities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of work now to try and make it really easy for the rest of the team to use, adopt, and understand. This allows them to both pull data from the prepared reports and build new analysis in Excel if they need to,\u201d said Temme.\nStaff at Zip feel empowered to use Calumo to source the data they need. She explained, \u201cWe\u2019ve done a fair amount of training over the last six months as the team has rapidly expanded. It\u2019s all about teaching everyone to fish so they can become super users themselves.\u201d\nAs a global entity working across multiple time zones, the numbers are always changing. It\u2019s essential that all Zip staff have real-time access to the data they need, including the CFO. Full transparency through Calumo makes everyone\u2019s jobs a lot easier and innovations and time saving allows for new ideas to breed. Real-time access to data is the secret formula for the success of a rapidly growing company like Zip.\nAdaptability Empowers Growth for\u202fZip\nImplementing Calumo Meant Faster Monthly Closes\n\u201cWithout Calumo, our closes would be pushed out phenomenally and would definitely require an increase in headcount. At the moment, I\u2019m the only person in Group Financial Control,\u201d said Temme.\nThrough rapid growth and acquisitions, automation has been essential to Zip\u2019s success. The flexibility to quickly adapt to change as the requirements for month-end close expand has made Temme\u2019s impossible mission possible.\n\u201cA big chunk of our success is down to the fact that we\u2019ve got Calumo set up to pull everything. We\u2019ve got our reports set up in the dynamics, and I\u2019ve got the support of Calumo consultants. So, without that, we would be trying to consolidate 30 sets of accounts every month. It would be impossible.\u201d\nDifferent Lenses Means Better Informed Decision-Making\nIn the last nine months of growth, Zip\u2019s board has completely changed. Calumo has the flexibility to enable the different lines of data investigation requested by each new board member.\n\u201cA new board will have a different lens and hotspots than the old board. Therefore, what they want, what they need, and how we need to show and represent the business, changes. Now, I\u2019m changing our management pack every month, two months at least.\u201d\nWith Calumo, leadership at Zip can easily create their own reporting packs confident that the underlying numbers are correct. Without fear of manual error or inconsistencies in the data, the finance team can focus on providing deeper business insights to help efficiently guide decision-makers on the board.\nFeatures like Publications and Skylights automate the production and distribution of reports, ensuring that senior stakeholders have constant oversight of the latest relevant data.\nSeamless Acquisitions for a Growing Business\nIn 2020, Zip acquired QuadPay and were able to get the data integrated into their system within 30 days with Calumo.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty proud to say that we got our United States operation up in 30 days. Our first month-end close with the US office as part of the group we were able to report them from Calumo within our group,\u201d Temme said.\nZip Continues to Expand its use of Calumo\nLooking to the future, Calumo will continue to be crucial for the success of the ever-expanding BNPL company, as it expands its data function to include non-financial information.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started to enter and analyse non-financial data in Calumo. The next step will be to take it directly from Tableau and pop it into Calumo so we don\u2019t have to manually enter those things,\u201d said Temme.\nTemme explains that Zip uses Calumo well under 50% of its capability. \u201cIf we were to take the handbrakes off and had unlimited time and resources, I know we could make it absolutely dance.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nFinancial reporting has much in common with flying a commercial aircraft, in that it can often be a long and extremely involved process, there is precious little room for error, and it is quite easy to be brought back down to Earth with a bump. When daa chose to bring in a single reporting tool to supersede the multitude of different ones that were used in the past, it wanted a solution that would really give its reporting wings.\ndaa is responsible for the operation and management of Dublin and Cork airports in Ireland. The company\u2019s subsidiaries include the global travel retail company ARI and daa International, and it also manages a number of duty free shops in North America, the Middle East, and India. Furthermore, daa recently won the contract to manage the new Terminal 5 at King Khaled International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Headquartered at Dublin Airport, the company employs close to 3,000 people in Ireland and overseas.\nNew Tool Sweeps Clean\nAccording to Fawad Akhtar, group treasury analyst at daa, around four years ago, the Finance Team at the Shared Services Centre asked for a flexible real-time reporting tool to complement the Hyperion software which was not real-time.\n\u201cBasically, after conducting some research, they chose GL Wand from insightsoftware and daa quickly saw just how effective it was. We immediately realized this would be the ideal solution for us and chose to implement it across the entire group,\u201d he says.\nAkhtar explains that prior to adopting GL Wand, there was a proliferation of various reporting tools that were being used across the group. These included not only Hyperion, but also Discoverer, Oracle Reports, and Client ADI. The latter was no longer supported in Oracle R12, the version daa had just upgraded to recently.\n\u201cThis helped us to realize that we needed to find a single solution that could do the job for us,\u201d he says.\nAkhtar adds that apart from having multiple tools to deal with, the company\u2019s finance team was, at the time, heavily reliant on the IT department to help them to manipulate, build and create reports and templates.\n\u201cThis created challenges for the finance department, which could not adequately build its own reports, as well as for IT, which was being drawn away from its core functions to assist in this regard.\u201d\nFast Instead of Furious\nWhen it came to month-end, Akhtar suggests that the company had previously been hampered by the very structured nature of some of the tools being used, such as Oracle FSGs.\n\u201cWe required a solution that was flexible, easy-to-use, and that could assist us in quickly putting together reports from Excel. This was critical as running a business report, for example, takes an enormous amount of time. We needed a tool that would reduce the length of time taken to create reports.\n\u201cGL Wand changed all of this quite dramatically, as the entire process of preparing, generating, and analyzing a report is now much faster. This, in turn, offers analysts the opportunity to spend more time scrutinizing the data and checking for any errors once the report has been generated.\u201d\nHe adds that the flexibility of the GL Wand solution is also impressive, as it has enabled the daa to generate everything from balance sheets and trial balances to profit and loss statements. \u201cIt is great for compiling month-end business reports for management, and it also allows for individuals to build customized reports for specific business areas.\u201d\nWhy Wait for IT?\n\u201cUltimately,\u201d continues Akhtar, \u201cGL Wand offers users flexibility that is difficult to beat.\u201d \u201cIn the past,\u201d he says, \u201cit was left up to the IT department to write the reports, because of the complexity and rigid structure of the tools being used. This meant that generating reports took an inordinate amount of time.\u201d\n\u201cWith GL Wand, we are able to write reports without any assistance and this really speeds up the process. More crucially, we are able to quickly and easily adapt and change these reports as required,\u201d he says.\n\u201cFurthermore, GL Wand has made that act of generating and processing reports much faster and simpler, because the tool itself is user-friendly. In addition,\u201d he says, \u201cthe solution is flexible enough to allow users to create and amend their own reports. They can also create new content and use the same processes for different reports.\u201d\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I am able to use GL Wand to develop some of my own personal reports, purely for analysis purposes. This is a level of flexibility we simply never had before and is really what makes this tool work for us.\u201d\nSharing is Caring\nWhile training the daa\u2019s people to use GL Wand was a reasonably simple matter, he adds that the company wanted to ensure that everyone thoroughly understood how it worked and how it could be tweaked to suit the different business units.\nSince the nature of daa\u2019s work is such that a multitude of complex and differing reports need to be generated, Akhtar explains that the company ensured that its people undertook extensive training.\n\u201cdaa\u2019s Shared Services Center originally chose GL Wand from insightsoftware and quickly realized this would be the ideal solution to implement across the entire group.\u201d\n\u201cGL Wand is extremely intuitive and easy to use and offers us a level of flexibility we simply never had before.\u201d\nGetting Granular\nWhile the tool has many capabilities worth recommending, the one that particularly stands out to Akhtar is how well it works when it comes to combining data from multiple sources. The fact that it allows users to drill down as far as they need really does assist greatly in properly analyzing the numbers.\n\u201cPart of my role is to be able to understand and demonstrate to management where the different figures shown in the reports actually come from. The ability to generate customized reports outlining specific content and the ability to drill down to granular level with regard to figures has been a godsend.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nRendine Constructions is a second generation, family-owned company in Geelong, Australia. It began in 1973, as a small carpentry subcontractor before transforming into a multifaceted commercial and civil construction builder. With an established maintenance and emergency management division delivering first-class constructions throughout Victoria, Rendine creates municipal and community buildings.\nIn 2017, Rendine delivered the region\u2019s first construction hub where it offers engineering, design, civil and construction services. Now, Rendine\u2019s 43 staff boasts a collection of expertise rarely found within a singular construction company, defining it as a leader in the industry. Rendine\u2019s push towards business information modelling to improve industry intelligence and streamline processes has led to advancements in its technical capabilities and its move into the world of modular building.\nRendine Streamlines for Growth \nMeeting a demand that Australia didn\u2019t know it needed, Rendine has become the go to company for portable buildings. These building support the major institutions of Australia, including schools and sports pavilions. This innovative method of construction is proven safer for its customers with work done away from children and athletes, the frames are 95% prebuilt at Rendine\u2019s construction hub before moved to their destination.\nIn 2015, Rendine implemented Viewpoint Vista, an industry-leading construction enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The ERP provided reporting of critical financial data with visibility and control.\nBut as the company grew, so did its need for smarter data. Colin Drain Finance Manager at Rendine says his role has expanded since he joined, now working with three account assistants.\n\u201cMy role has grown enormously since I joined because of the number of different contracts that we are running at any one time as well as the size and complexity of those individual projects.\u201d\nWith Rendine\u2019s growth, Drain and his team struggled with a lack of Excel friendly reporting. What Rendine needed was a tool that could make the data work for Drain\u2019s team.\nFocusing on More Important Business \nRendine needed a tool that would allow it to:\n\nClose Its Books Faster.\u00a0Rendine needed to connect to its live ERP data from inside Excel. The Finance team wanted the ability to quickly create custom reports and get a jump start with pre-configured queries from management. There was a need to drill down to see the data behind the numbers and get instant answers to critical business questions.\u00a0\nStreamline Reporting for All Their Data Sources. Rendine sought to bridge the gap between its company data and insightful reporting by combining its general ledger and non-general ledger data from multiple platforms in a single report. Rendine needed secure access to data from within Excel and the ability to create real-time financial and operational reports.\nMake Reports Designed for Finance. Drain\u2019s team required a fast, flexible, and intuitive solution purpose-built to meet their needs. Ideally, the team wants to be able to easily create reports themselves without relying on IT or expensive consultants.\n\nRendine found its reporting solution in Spreadsheet Server. insightsoftware assisted with its implementation and Rendine was quickly up and running.\nWith Spreadsheet Server\u2019s self-serve custom reports, ability to connect data from multiple platforms, and automated preparation of data, month end close is now as simple as a click of a button for Rendine.\n\u201cAs soon as the all the invoices have been posted and we want to close off for the month, all I have to do is refresh the data and let the project managers know that the costs are up to date,\u201d said Drain. \u201cThen they can start their preparation for monthly review.\u201d\nSpreadsheet Server Streamlines Rendine\u2019s Reporting Process \nTime Better Spent\nOne of the biggest wins for Drain is the time his team saves on menial tasks with Spreadsheet Server. At one time, Rendine has between 15 and 20 live projects on the go. This is a lot to juggle for a finance team with critical monthly reporting as a key part of their jobs. Spreadsheet Server not only speeds up the reporting process, it guarantees that the data is reliable.\n\u201cEvery report that is automated is going to be time that you don\u2019t have to check the data,\u201d said Drain. \u201cImplementing Spreadsheet Server easily saves us four to six hours a week.\u201d\nEasy Dashboard Communication for Decision-makers\nBeyond the Finance team, there are always going to be report requests. Managers want to know what is going on in the company. For Drain, this means creating and extending reporting to the decision makers above.\n\u201cSpreadsheet Sever has helped massively with our directors who don\u2019t have that in-depth technical knowledge,\u201d said Drain. \u201cThey just want something that\u2019s easy to view and understand. Now the finance team reviews the report, which then automatically goes to the management team.\u201d\nRendine is like most midsized companies. Everyone wants one page that shows the status of their projects \u2013 which ones are on track, behind or over budget. Customers often have similar requests.\n\u201cWe need dashboard templates to help customers and present them data which is coming from a variety of reports,\u201d said Drain. \u201cWe can give them key metrics that they are looking for on one page. Just the essential data about the progress of their project.\u201d\nFurther Functionality for Rendine\nRendine will continue exploring further functionality of Spreadsheet Server. Its goal is to eventually be able to self-serve by building and tweaking its own reports.\n\u201cWe want to expand billing reports so we can look at contracts, values, variations, and things like aged debtors,\u201d said Drain. \u201cThis would help us to tighten up our credit control. We\u2019re working with the insightsoftware team to help build out new reports for this and we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d\nExploring functionality is especially valuable for construction and once the report is set up its easy to reuse.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an easy functionality inside Spreadsheet Server. When you get into the operational side or profit and loss by project the data needs to be smarter. There will always be a job cost, a project cost, contracts and billing. Having a tool that speaks to everyone involved is key.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nOne of the largest pot plant orchids growers in the Netherlands, Levoplant began in 1969 as a tomato production company. In the last few decades, it transitioned primarily to a potted plant company where it has developed into one of the largest suppliers of orchids in Europe. A high-volume supplier with a complete range tailored to exporters, wholesalers, garden centres, and florists, Levoplant inspires the industry with innovative technology, and its capacity to deliver high-quality plants all-year round.\nLevoplant needed support to keep up with innovation \nInnovation is in the DNA of Levoplant. Since its start, the company has prided itself on being on the cutting edge of technology. From advanced cultivating machinery in the greenhouse to methodical climate-controlled delivery, Levoplant has remained agile, adapting to the constantly changing demands of the market.\nTen years ago, Levoplant added automation to its reporting process, adopting Jet Reports to help improve reporting for the growing company. This meant easy self-service financial and operational reporting inside of Excel. Still, Frank van Holsteijn, Application Manager at Levoplant, and his team noticed they had lots of data they weren\u2019t able to use. Levoplant\u2019s sophisticated technology was getting ahead of its data. Like many orchids, it needed a strong stake (read: financial analytics tool) to support its rapid growth.\n\u201cWe could track data for each of the three and a half million plants we grow in our main location. For each plant, we knew their temperature every five minutes for the last two years. We knew how many flowers each plant had, how big their leaves were, and at what price they were sold. But we couldn\u2019t make a bigger narrative with the data,\u201d said van Holsteijn.\nLevoplant was trying to cobble together trends through a swath of disconnected Excel sheets, Jet Reports, and Power BI reports.\n\u201cWe had so much data, but we didn\u2019t know where to look for the information we needed. It wasn\u2019t comprehensible anymore.\u201d\nVan Holsteijn knew he needed to put Levoplants data in a central place where it could increase data quality, enable self-service of analysis and solve performance problems.\nDe BI Controller B.V was the Perfect Implementation Partner \nLevoplant found its data quality solution in Jet Analytics. After a quick implementation and a brief two-day training session with Erwin Staal from the insightsoftware partner \u2018De BI Controller B.V.\u2019, Levoplant was up and running. Supported by Jet Analytics, Levoplant could lean into its innovations confident it could handle the added data complexity.\n\u201cLevoplant wanted a solution it could maintain and adjust itself. We did a hands-off approach using Microsoft Azure and skipped the standard cubes to build awesome data models in Power BI. With low upfront investments, the flexibility of Azure and sparing consultancy here and there, Jet Analytics scored for Levoplant on all fronts,\u201d said Staal.\nData Quality With Jet Analytics \nThere are a lot of variables that impact the quality of Levoplant\u2019s crop. Right now, it monitors some of them, but Levoplant knows there are over one hundred variables that impact a plants growth. The more data Levoplant can visualise with Jet Analytics, the more efficiently it can grow flowers.\n\u201cWe can see trends and opportunities and are no longer bogged down in tedious manual processes when we are looking for key information,\u201d said van Holsteijn.\nJet Analytics offered Levoplant a single source of truth for all its financial and operational reporting. Levoplant gained control over its data with self-service reporting and analytics. Jet also enabled the team to report across multiple data sources and roll-out faster, easier BI dashboards.\nJet Analytics offered Levoplant the ability to:\n\nSimplify Data Estate. Jet Analytics empowered Levoplant to harness multiple data sources for fast, reliable reporting and analytics. With an intuitive data preparation automation and data modelling solution, Levoplant had the tools to support its reporting and analytics\u202fneeds. Through a modern datawarehouse and tabular models, Levoplant could easily report inside Excel or Power BI, with no coding and without requiring technical expertise.\nEnable Self-Service Reporting and Analytics. With easy, quick self-service analytics and reporting, Levoplant could manage and create the reports it needed, without relying on IT to prepare its data. With a quick implementation and 2-day training session, Levoplant could focus on what the data was saying.\u00a0\u00a0\nSpeed Up Reporting. Jet Analytics allowed Levoplant to combine multiple data sources into a modern data warehouse with customizable tabular models, on a platform that allows much faster configurations than manual coding. Now Levoplant can build and share dashboards within minutes and gain valuable business insights.\nDecrease Cost of Ownership. By bringing custom reporting and analytics capabilities in-house, Levoplant got the self-sufficient tool it wanted and greatly reduced dependency on expensive technical experts. Jet Analytics is built to support rapid changes by simplifying the ETL process, with no coding required. Levoplant can now maximize productivity by centralizing data access rules, and by automating data refreshes.\n\nJet Analytics Ups Levoplant\u2019s Performance \nSeeing the Forest for the Trees\nNot your traditional office setting, the heart of Levoplant is in the greenhouse. Jet Analytics offers simplified, precise data that speaks to both those handling the dirt and C-level executives.\n\u201cWith so many moving hands in this business, it is important to be able to see the forest for the trees. We need the data to give us a big picture,\u2019 said van Holsteijn.\nJet Analytics\u2019 user-friendly drag-and-drop interfaces simplify data management and report creation that anyone in the company can use. Levoplant also established a system of record with historical data and multiple data sources that guarantees everyone is using the same information to run their reports. This way the right people can see trends and move with them.\nAnd Levoplant\u2019s stock is constantly growing to meet demand, meaning certain times of year require more stock. With Jet Analytics, Levoplant can now combine current data with historic sales trends to more accurately forecast supply and demand. This means more accurately quoting delivery time and cost to customers.\nVisions of the Future\nLevoplant is just getting started and knows there is a long way to go before maximizing the potential of its data. Keeping with its history of innovation, Levoplant wants to expand its use of Jet Analytics to other areas of the company.\n\u201cWe are still missing opportunities. We analyse some of the process, but there are other sources that we have, like logistic manufacturing software, that we\u2019d like to visualize. We look forward to expanding with Jet Analytics,\u201d said van Holsteijn.\n"

        "content": "\n\nkolb Cleaning Technology GmbH, Germany, is one of the world\u00b4s leading manufacturers for cleaning systems used in the electronics producing industry. Located in Willich, Germany, this owner-managed, medium-sized enterprise has gained international reputation as an innovative powerhouse, known to be the inventor and pioneer of aqueous system cleaning in the electronics industry.\nAfter 30 years, kolb continues to set new benchmarks for machinery engineering, chemistry development, and process design. Fulfilling the high-quality requirements of its customers, the business offers an integrated solution: cleaning systems with most innovative technology. It combines this with process optimized cleaning detergents that correspond to the economic and environmental requirements of today and of the future.\nStuck on Manual Processes \nkolb Cleaning Technology prides itself on fast delivery times. As a global leader in the cleaning machinery manufacturing market with 50 employees, the business has a reputation for acting quickly and efficiently. Where competitors maintain a 20-30 week lead time, kolb can deliver in six to eight weeks while producing a high-quality result.\nHowever, the company previously relied on manual processes during month-end and year-end close. In addition to being time consuming for the financial team, the business relied on IT to customize and generate ad hoc reports. Because its IT staff were tasked with other critical duties, they were unable to prioritize finance needs, causing considerable delays to the close process.\nIntroducing Jet Reports \nWhen Christian Ortmann, CEO of kolb Cleaning Technology, attended finance training with business partner, EC Consulting, Ortmann caught a glimpse of Jet Reports on the screen and knew he had to adopt the software. Ortmann was immediately impressed with the program and asked for more information.\n\u201cWhen we had the finance training, I realized within seconds we needed Jet Reports,\u201d said Ortmann. \u201cI was responsible for monthly and yearly reporting. At the time, we copied data from the ERP to Excel, then checked to make sure the data was in line. From the moment I saw Jet Reports, I knew we needed to integrate a faster solution.\u201d\nOrtmann immediately saw that Jet Reports could offered kolb an array of benefits, including:\n\nAutomating manual processes\nWorking seamlessly with Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Business Central\nProviding refreshable, up-to-date reports\nRelieving IT department workload\nPutting the power to report into the hands of those who manage them\n\nFostering Strong Business Connections \nkolb reached out to EC Consulting to assist with implementing Jet Reports. Throughout the process, the two companies maintained a strong connection as the business grew. Once Jet Reports was implemented, Ortmann knew staff would require extensive training, and he trusted EC Consulting to provide it for the team.\n\u201cIf there is a problem, they EC Consulting can easily fix it for us,\u201d Ortmann explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a great partnership. If we have an issue, we work on it together. On a human side, we also have a very good connection.\u201d\nResults \nOverall, the automated, refreshable data provided by Jet Reports helps kolb foster greater trust within the business. \u201cIn the past, you needed to bring data from the ERP into Excel manually,\u201d said Ortmann. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t trust that the data we had was fully accurate. With Jet Reports\u2019 refresh button, we can assure people it\u2019s live data from the database. Now, they trust the data.\u201d\nJet Reports saves kolb a significant amount of time off its formerly manual processes, including:\n\n2 days per month on reporting\n1 day per month on supply chain and inventory management\n1 day per week using Jet Hub\n1.5 days per week by automating report schedules\n\nPutting the Power into Finance\u2019s Hands \nBefore introducing Jet Reports, kolb\u2019s IT department was unable to prioritize completing critical tasks for its finance and engineering departments, delaying much-needed reports from being run. Jet Reports helped relieve the company\u2019s overtaxed IT department while putting the power to run reports into the hands of those who needed them most.\n\u201cWe have more people feeling comfortable designing in Jet Repots,\u201d explained Ortmann. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not IT people, it\u2019s people in finance, engineering, and sales. There are no IT people who program now. Instead, Jet designers in our company run reports because they know precisely what they need. Jet Reports generates accurate numbers for them.\u201d\nAutomated Report Scheduling with Jet Hub \nkolb uses Jet Hub to schedule reports automatically. Overall, the business saves a full day every week on scheduling and administrative tasks with the solution\u2019s automation capabilities. \u201cWe have a lot of complex reports that take 45 minutes to an hour to generate,\u201d said Ortmann. \u201cWhen you report manually, you address tasks to people, but you also have to check the report at the right time because some reports, like inventory, must be generated at the right time.\u201d\nJet Hub helps kolb\u2019s staff run reports on a set schedule so that they no longer need to set reminders or stop in the middle of other critical tasks to shift focus on timely reporting. \u201cThere are a lot of things we don\u2019t have to think about now because we use Jet Hub,\u201d Ortmann said. \u201cIt saves us a minimum 1.5 days per week. You don\u2019t have to be reminded of which reports to run at the right time because Jet Hub automates that process.\u201d\nInventory and Supply Chain Improvements \nShipping and supply chain delays are a major concern for manufacturing companies worldwide. Delays often run rampant, leaving businesses reprioritizing, rescheduling, and floundering on inventory management. With Jet Reports, kolb maintains a competitive edge. The solution allows the company to keep better track of inventory without requiring in-depth technical knowledge. \u201cIf someone comes to us and asks us how many pieces of inventory we have, we can open Jet Reports, refresh the data, and Jet Reports will tell us exactly how much we have,\u201d said Ortmann.\nOverall, Jet Reports saves the logistics department hours on critical supply chain management. \u201cIn the past, we had a lot of issues with pieces that haven\u2019t been picked up,\u201d Ortman explained. \u201cWe\u2019d forward a list to order processing, where they\u2019d check with distributors. Today, we have a report that automatically runs twice a week, and we get a report for the part that hasn\u2019t been picked up.\u201d\nJet Reports enables the business to apply specific filters to match parts it needs, ultimately saving an entire day per month on inventory. By inputting a delivery note number, the user is taken to the corresponding item, which can be forwarded easily to distribution partners.\nBuilding A Strong Data Culture \nSince implementing Jet Reports, kolb grew a strong data culture from a blank slate. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a data culture before Jet Reports,\u201d Ortmann said. \u201cIn the past, the IT department was responsible for data management. At the time, we had to go to IT and explain what we needed and why we needed it. IT often didn\u2019t have time to run the reports quickly.\u201d\nOnce the business installed Jet Reports, it was able to shift responsibility for creating and editing reports to finance department, sales, and engineering. \u201cThe people who need the reports run them. In Jet Reports, it\u2019s easy to collect, work with, and double check the data.\u201d\nPlans for the Future \nThe world is getting more complex, as are business processes. To stay ahead of the curve, kolb plans to fully leverage Jet Report\u2019s ability to drill down into critical business data. Moving forward, the company plans to:\n\nMigrate from Dynamics NAV to Dynamics 365 Business Central\nFocus on more granular analytics\nUtilize more of Jet\u2019s features\n\nBefore adopting Jet Reports, kolb relied heavily on manual processes and its IT department to generate and edit reports. As a result of adopting the solution, those who need reports the most are empowered to easily create and modify reports, and drill down on essential details. From better supply chain monitoring to building a data culture from scratch, kolb has seen strong company-wide improvement.\n"

Employing 14,000 people with annual revenue of roughly $1.5 billion, Aramark Uniform Services estimates its employees wash 4.5 million pounds of laundry, complete 20,000 orders, and drive 400,000 miles each day.\nChallenges\nLike most companies, Aramark Uniform Services underwent a transformation to adapt to the changing economic conditions of the past several years. The IT department found it was unable to keep pace with the changing technology needs of the business because it was tied to different legacy systems. The IT organization began a company-wide technology transformation initiative named \u2018Cornerstone,\u2019 which represented an overhaul of the entire IT infrastructure and application framework. IT planned to consolidate from seven data centers down to two and replace all core enterprise business systems with modern packaged software solutions.\nThe first phase of Cornerstone involved the re-implementation of Oracle E-Business Suite for the company\u2019s core ERP system. The second phase will involve replacing a route accounting system to run the more than 200 Aramark laundry sites across the U.S.\nIn conjunction with these efforts, IT worked to develop a foundation for unified reporting and data management across the enterprise. The desired reporting foundation would involve an enterprise data warehouse with an operational data store and a common reporting solution. A critical success factor for this project is the ability for the reporting foundation to tie together Aramark\u2019s rental business with its direct sales business, which previously had been two distinct entities.\n\u201cWith all of the different databases across our enterprise, our data was spread out everywhere,\u201d said Kevin Loo, Director of Data Architecture, who architected the enterprise data management strategy within Cornerstone. \u201cOur vision was to consolidate and eliminate a lot of the legacy critical systems, employ a best practice and governance process on one single system, and unify our reporting tools. A lot of the reporting had been done previously by just extracting data and dumping it into Microsoft Excel and we wanted to provide more sophisticated reporting capabilities to our business users.\u201d\nSolution\nAramark\u2019s IT department took a systematic, practical approach as it chose the components of its new reporting environment, taking into account both IT and end user skill sets and tool familiarity. IT examined the ease of implementation and the total cost of ownership of a packaged analytics solution in terms of how much customization would need to be done versus how much content would be available out of the box.\nIT also considered a build versus buy scenario and gathered information detailing the time and cost it would have required for them to build a customized Oracle reporting environment versus what resources would be required for reporting within a packaged analytics environment. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have ETL expertise and knew that would be a requirement if we were to follow the build strategy,\u201d said Loo.\n\u201cWe took the opportunity to examine what hadn\u2019t worked in past projects and then made the necessary changes, including selecting a BI partner with the right analytics solution,\u201d said Michael Beattie, Vice President of IT Planning and Support. \u201cWe focused on leveraging the applications for better integration from a transaction endpoint through to reporting for business analysis. We put a great deal of thought into how we wanted to set up the chart of accounts and what type of data and analytics we wanted as part of the outcome of this initiative and then chose Angles for Oracle to help get us there.\u201d\nResults\nAramark completed the first phase of the Angles for Oracle analytics implementation, which includes integration with the Oracle ERP platform in order to create a single repository of data that users can report on. The next step was to pull in the remaining operational data including CRM (Salesforce.com) and Route Accounting.\nManagement will now have the opportunity to release reports to dozens of market centers (sites that manage a group of regional locations) containing information about region-specific Profit & Loss, General Ledger, Balance Sheet, Fixed Assets, Inventory, etc.\nApproximately 150 end-users at the market centers benefit from these initial reports, and once the route accounting system information is included in the reports, an additional 300 to 500 users will leverage that information.\nThough Aramark Uniform Services was still in the implementation phase at the time of this writing, IT expected 600 initial users across sales, marketing, finance, and operations to benefit from the new reporting capabilities.\n"

        "content": "\n\n\nTime to generate a trial balance slashed from 4 hours to just seconds\nAbility to spend more time understanding narrative behind the numbers to inform strategic insight\nGreatly improved budgeting ownership and engagement from management\n\nHaven Home Safe (HHS) is one of Australia\u2019s only fully integrated homelessness services and affordable housing providers. It has been providing homelessness support services and affordable rental housing to vulnerable Victorians for over four decades.\nHHS is a not-for-profit organisation, employing nearly 200 staff across 4 offices with 1800+ homes under management, a balance sheet of assets worth $300 million and an annual turnover of $30 million.\nOriginal challenge\nFor many years, HHS had been looking for an effective way to integrate its asset management systems with its housing management and general ledger systems.\nThe Vision\nFifteen years ago, HHS was servicing 200 affordable rental properties, mostly in regional Victoria.\nIn 2020, this number has soared to over 1800 properties in a range of built form across a growing geographic footprint from the outer suburbs of metropolitan Melbourne, across to Geelong through to Mildura on the banks of the Murray River and most regional centres in between.\nWith an ambitious strategic plan to house and support more people, HHS needed to scale at speed.\nTo achieve this, the CEO Ken Marchingo AM was committed to transformational technology and tools that would provide his management team with the robust and timely information they required to make the kind of decisions that would effectively allow HHS to expand its capabilities to serve people in need.\nImplementation\nHHS suffered from a disintegrated, separate, stand-alone housing system, disconnected from its finance system. It had implemented an integrated tenancy management system, which provided an improvement in integrating housing and finance data.\nThat was data capture solved, but real leverage comes through data access, transparency and insights. HHS needed to get the right information to the right people at the right time in a way that translated that information to immediate benefit.\nAfter comprehensive research, Calumo was selected due to its usability, web delivery and integration with the advanced functionality of Microsoft Office as the \u2018bridge\u2019 for HHS to maximise the value of its data and optimise performance.\nHHS also had tight timeframes signing up on 4 December, requesting that the system be implemented to report the December financials by the middle of the following January.\nThere were only seven consulting days and five weeks to implement, reconcile, test, train, and build the reports. The monthly reports, with far deeper detailed analysis than they could ever do previously, were delivered ahead of schedule on 10 January.\nBased on the success of the initial implementation, HHS decided to engage Calumo to deliver the full budgeting model, again with extremely tight deadlines.\nWith a joint commitment, the two teams worked together such that every agreed deliverable was met. The combined team rolled out the product, onboarded management, delivered the training and produced the budget with enough time to carry out a detailed analysis and what-if scenarios.\nResults & benefits achieved\nThe benefits HHS has experienced can be broken down into four different areas:\n\nHundreds of hours in time savings\nThe process efficiency has been revolutionary for HHS. It\u2019s a game-changing for the finance team to have a tool that can draw from real-time data and produce meaningful reports at the click of a button.By way of example, before Calumo, it would take four hours to run a trial balance, it can now be achieved in a matter of seconds. The monthly reports would take days combining data from multiple sources and manipulating the data in Excel \u2013 now they are produced automatically without any effort.\n\nFaster, smarter decision making\nPreviously, due to the manual and time-consuming process, the finance team was spending all its time finalising profit and loss reports at the end of the month and there was no time left to understand the numbers. The team was capable, but the inefficiencies in the systems wouldn\u2019t allow them to apply their skills. This is now a thing of the past.\nAnalysis is now in the hands of both finance people and business people. Making decisions autonomously, with data and with confidence has become commonplace.\nGreater ownership amongst management\nManagers can now review, modify and complete their budgets using direct entry into Calumo. Because the managers have created the budget, ownership of results naturally rises \u2013 which has boosted engagement enormously. What\u2019s more, have a level of access which would have previously required a one-on-one briefing with a senior finance member.\nA move from score keeping to smarter business analysis\nAcross the organisation, the focus has moved from simple quarterly financial reporting in arrears, to business intelligence analysis \u2013 allowing for managers to look at real-time actual versus budget reporting, providing more visibility over expenses and the ability to make smarter decisions.The results have exceeded Haven Home Safe\u2019s expectations. Calumo gives their people, from the frontline to the Board, the tools they need to make the informed decisions that are necessary to grow and scale their organization to help more people in need.\n\n"

        "content": "\nOutdated, Manual Processes and a Lot of Paper \nJan L\u00f8jmand joined Fonden Mariehjemmene in April 2021 as the chief financial officer. He recalls walking into the role with trepidation. He said, \u201cWhen I first started, I found outdated, manual processes that used a lot of paper. Each home had its own accounting structure and their own way of doing things in the same ERP system. It was a nightmare.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cThey did their reporting in [Microsoft] Excel based on a printout from the ERP system. The reports had little information, so we couldn\u2019t tell whether the homes were profitable from month to month. Five of the homes had accumulated a high loss, but we didn\u2019t know why because that information wasn\u2019t available.\u201d\nThis situation, along with the following challenges, made it difficult to understand the foundation\u2019s financial situation:\n\nBackward-looking month-end reports\nLimited visibility into operations across all homes\nInconsistent data fields and report information\nManual data entry resulting in data inaccuracies\nReliance on the IT team for information or ad hoc reports\nOutdated applications that connected to the enterprise resource planning (ERP) software\nNoncompliance with government requirements\n\nThe organization was struggling. Its accountants didn\u2019t have enough time to do their work because they were manually entering data into Excel.\nTime for Much Needed Change \nL\u00f8jmand was determined to modernize Fonden Mariehjemmene\u2019s business operations by establishing the same accounting setup across all the homes. He said, \u201cWe needed a tool that could consistently show the same information for each home to ensure the processes were identical.\u201d\nA Solution Partner\nTo start, L\u00f8jmand contacted technology partner Jakob Wrang from Vektus, an experienced Business Central provider and consultant. He told Wrang about his accounting and operational reporting challenges and what he wanted in a solution. His primary goal was to help the care homes gain a better view of their financial data and insights into their operations for more informed decision-making.\nTo achieve that, he needed a solution that could:\n\nAutomate the reporting process.\nEstablish consistent data structures and formats across the organization.\nProvide self-service capabilities for nontechnical users to get the information they needed.\nSupport drill down into the details behind the numbers.\nReduce the time to deliver reports without repeating the process for each of the 20 care homes.\n\nL\u00f8jmand stated, \u201cI can\u2019t run our business without our ERP system, planning system, and seller system. Each needs to be the best performing system. That was my goal and the challenge I gave to Jakob: \u2018I need the best system. Tell me how to get it.\u2019\u201d\nThat\u2019s when Wrang told L\u00f8jmand about Jet Reports. L\u00f8jmand said, \u201cJakob explained how Jet Reports can show data from different companies, structure it the same way, and distribute it to the business users who need the information. For Mariehjemmene, that level of efficiency and service was really important.\u201d\nIterative Implementation\nThrough an iterative process, the Vektus team helped implement Jet Reports for Fonden Mariehjemmene. \u201cThat\u2019s how Vektus gets the best results. It\u2019s utopia to think you could buy a plug-and-play BI tool, but then you just have a product. You have to know your prerequisites and work to get the correct results in the end,\u201d said L\u00f8jmand.\nAnd work they did. When mapping the accounts across all 20 care homes, they discovered many obstacles, pointing out just how different the processes were in each home. \u201cThrough each iteration, we were able to discuss the situation, make the fix, and learn from it. We needed this experience because it enabled us to see things in a new way.\u201d\nNonetheless, the process was worth it. L\u00f8jmand noted, \u201cThe Vektus team went quickly from clarifying the information to running the first report. I realized then we were on the right path. It was a big step forward from when we started.\u201d\nA Whole New Accounting Approach \nSince implementing Jet Reports, the accounting teams at Fonden Mariehjemmene have seen tremendous change in automating their accounting practices.\n\nIn Excel, the data can change, but with Jet Reports, you have a single source of truth every time you run a report.\n\u2014 Jan L\u00f8jmand, Chief Financial Officer, Fonden Mariehjemmene\n\nData Accuracy\n\u201cWith Jet Reports, we have a better data structure now than before and are seeing progress toward accuracy. That accuracy means building greater trust in our data and in our reporting,\u201d said L\u00f8jmand.\nThe accuracy stems from mapping the business\u2019s general ledger (G/L) accounts from its ERP to Jet Reports. This process enabled the streamlining of data for more consistency in the reports. L\u00f8jmand said, \u201cNow we can visibly see when numbers change. We can immediately check the data behind it, make the correction, and see the update with the right numbers.\u201d\nReporting Efficiency and Insights\n\nBesides visibility of profit-and-loss data, teams can also view balance and cash flow reports. Plus, changes to the salary system mean L\u00f8jmand\u2019s team can collect more information from the ERP and put it into Jet Reports.\nL\u00f8jmand explained, \u201cWe no longer have to look at 20 different reports about a home. I can run one report in Jet Reports and get one view that tells me about the state and setup of each care home at one time. I can also share the report with the board of directors for Mariehjemmene and with each of the boards that oversee our individual care homes so they can see what\u2019s happening across the organization.\u201d\n\u201cNow our teams only need to run Jet Reports to create a report, send it out by email, and they\u2019re done. We\u2019ve reduced the monthly reporting process across our care homes from 1.5 days to 10 minutes,\u201d said L\u00f8jmand. \u201cAlso, by removing the manual burden of entering the data in Excel and fixing errors, our accountants have more time to think strategically about the future of the organization and how to run things better.\u201d\n\nAccuracy is important for nonprofits. For us, that means getting insights in the operations of our care homes, which Jet Report provides.\n\u2014 Jan L\u00f8jmand, Chief Financial Officer, Fonden Mariehjemmene\n\nSelf-service for Business Users\n\nThe directors oversee management of each care home. By having one consistent report for all 20 care homes, they can see how their home is performing compared to the others. With the self-service capabilities, they can drill down into the information behind the data to quickly get the answers they need and better insights without help from IT.\nL\u00f8jmand says self-service is important because \u201cit allows them to verify\u202fimmediately whether the numbers are correct as reported.\u201d He added, \u201cI wanted a reporting tool where our directors and board members could review the same items in a report and use self-service if they wanted to do further analysis. Now they can with Jet Reports.\u201d\nLooking Ahead \nBy having greater insights into their operations, the Fonden Mariehjemmene team looks forward to doing more forecasting, price comparisons, and cost saving analysis.\n\u201cIn 2022, we\u2019ll have Jet Reports do more with taxation based on the required level of a person\u2019s care. We also want to define a specific board report that takes a more high-level look at whether each home is on track. We\u2019ve also never had a way to do forecasting before, so we plan to run forecasts this year for the first time,\u201d explained L\u00f8jmand.\nHe added, \u201cWhen our accounting team was manually entering numbers into Excel, they didn\u2019t have time to think about why or how to save money the next month. I need them to do this type of analysis every day, which they can only do by having more time. And Jet Reports is an important part of that.\u201d\nAbout Fonden Mariehjemmene\nFonden Mariehjemmene is a nonprofit organization in Copenhagen, Denmark. For over 60 years, it has provided care homes for the elderly and served individuals with physical or mental disabilities and vulnerable women. Today, it provides accounting, salary, HR, legal, and consulting services for 8 nursing homes and 12 care homes\u2014and growing.\n"

        "content": "\nIn Brief \n\nLogistics process automation leader improves efficiency and saves time with Longview Tax\nDelivered on time and on budget\n70% automated tax processes\n25-50% reduction in time spent on corporate income tax reporting\nMore robust tax reporting process\nClose collaboration between Vanderlande, insightsoftware, and implementation partner Taxvibes\n\nVanderlande is the global market leader for logistic process automation at airports. It is also a leading supplier of process automation solutions for warehousing and in the parcel market. Vanderlande\u2019s warehousing solutions are the first choice for many of the largest global e-commerce players and retailers in food, fashion, and general merchandise across the globe.\nVanderlande\u2019s baggage handling systems are capable of moving over 4 billion pieces around the world annually. More than 52 million parcels are sorted by its systems every day. Established in 1949, the company employs over 7,500 people and has established itself as a highly reliable partner for future-proof logistic process automation.\nHampered by Manual Processes \nVanderlande was acquired in 2017 by Toyota Industries Corporation which will help it to continue its sustainable profitable growth. At that point, the company had a strong need to increase the efficiency of its tax processes.\nIn March of 2020, Sebastiaan Stoffelen was hired by Vanderlande as a Tax Assurance Specialist. At that point, the company still relied upon time-consuming manual tax data management processes with a strong need to increase efficiency and reduce the risk of errors.\nThe tax team at Vanderlande were faced with increasing pressure to meet challenging deadlines for month-end close. The business needed a solution to automate the close processes, and empower them with accurate, real-time data that would save time while maintaining data integrity and quality.\n\u201cWhen I joined the company, we had a monthly tax reporting process that relied on various Excel spreadsheets, which was prone to error,\u201d said Stoffelen. \u201cThe reporting timeline we have within Vanderlande is quite narrow, so an automation tool was considered key to make the whole process more efficient and robust.\u201d\nIntroducing Longview Tax \nTasked with finding a solution, Stoffelen began to research the market to find a solution that best fit Vanderlande\u2019s needs. \u201cThe most important thing is that the tool shouldn\u2019t be the goal itself. You need to think about the business problem you\u2019re trying to solve, and the tool should facilitate that,\u201d Stoffelen said.\nAfter reviewing Vanderlande\u2019s tax reporting processes and establishing their requirements for a new solution, Stoffelen scheduled demos with seven potential software vendors. During this stage, his team agreed that their ideal solution must provide three key features:\n\nHigh degree of efficiency for automating existing processes\nSupplier\u2019s ability to achieve the implementation in a short timeframe\nAbility to be maintained by Vanderlande without the need for outside support\n\nAfter evaluating different options, Stoffelen and his team selected Longview Tax from insightsoftware. The solution was able to deliver on all Vanderlande\u2019s requirements, including:\n\nAutomating tax data collection, calculation, and consolidation\nFreeing up time to refocus efforts on more added-value activities such as review and analytics\nUncovering critical insights from tax data that supports strategic decision-making\n\n\u201cFor me, the key benefits for my review and analysis process are the drillable reports and tax analytics provided by Longview Tax. I can easily do my checks and validations in the most efficient manner,\u201d said Stoffelen.\nSmooth Sailing Through the Implementation Process \nTo assist with implementation, Vanderlande partnered with Taxvibes, a team of tax technology professionals dedicated to bridging gaps between tax and finance, with specific experience in automating tax reporting and transfer pricing processes. Vanderlande chose Taxvibes because of their extensive experience with tax automation processes.\nWhen the time came to implement Longview Tax, Vanderlande needed to meet a challenging timeline of November 2020 to March 2021. After holding an initial kick-off meeting, its Longview Tax instance was set up within weeks, and already up and running by mid-November. \u201cThe implementation plan and cost proposal were spot-on to what was delivered. The project was completed on time and on budget,\u201d Stoffelen explained. Some smaller issues inevitably came up during the implementation process, but these were resolved very quickly and satisfactorily.\nEven with a well-earned festive holiday break, the entire system was almost fully set up by January. A few final tweaks to the configuration still left time for the testing to be completed by mid-February. Because Vanderlande\u2019s implementation goals were achieved so quickly, Stoffelen\u2019s team had the luxury of dedicating approximately a month for user training and solution rollout.\nOne of the key success factors of the implementation project was the project team taking ownership and being involved as much as possible. By preparing and delivering the end user training themselves, Vanderlande\u2019s tax team built a strong understanding of how to use the Longview Tax solution. They were able to hit the ground running as soon as the new system was set up. They also gained the knowledge required to maintain the solution themselves on an ongoing basis.\nPartnering with Taxvibes was the right move for Vanderlande\nAnother key success factor was the close collaboration between Vanderlande, insightsoftware, and Taxvibes, using weekly calls to remain aligned and ensure that the implementation was on track. Through these partnerships, Vanderlande was able to leverage both the tax reporting advice and industry best practice from Taxvibes, as well as the product knowledge and integration expertise of insightsoftware. This enabled them to have a smooth implementation process whilst also ensuring the result met all their business specific requirements. \u201cOur shared goal was to automate the tax reporting processes in a user-friendly way, enabling the team to move from collecting to reviewing tax data and thus trusting the results,\u201d said Peter van Tiggele, Tax Automation specialist at Taxvibes.\nThe tax team at Vanderlande is delighted with the advice and guidance provided by Taxvibes. \u201cTaxvibes provided us with hands-on experience,\u201d said Stoffelen. \u201cThey brought the practical knowledge from other clients they worked with, which was extremely valuable for the scoping session and during the implementation process. Also, Peter and his colleagues at Taxvibes challenged us from both a technical and a tax accounting perspective, which improved our decisions. This proved to be one of the success factors of the implementation.\u201d\nResults \nGreater Usability\nAs a result of the Longview Tax implementation, Vanderlande has consolidated their tax data into a single source of the truth. Because the company is currently running business partly remotely, this is especially important. No matter where a user is in the world, they can pull data from one easy-to-access location.\nIn terms of user interface, Longview Tax was a perfect match for what Vanderlande needed. Longview Tax provided greater usability for Stoffelen\u2019s team, as well as improved robustness and automated validations.\n\u201cImplementing Longview Tax resulted in a bespoke component that was built in the specific way that Vanderlande needs journal entries to be output by the system,\u201d Stoffelen explained. \u201cWith the help of Taxvibes, we have tailor-made functionality for that.\u201d\nImproved Efficiency\nVanderlande has seen a variety of benefits by using insightsoftware\u2019s solution, including:\n\n70% automated tax calculations\n25-50% reduction in time spent on corporate income tax reporting\nMore robust tax reporting process\n\n\u201cBefore I kicked off the project, I did a survey with our user group to ask how much time they were spending on the corporate income tax process with the existing spreadsheets,\u201d Stoffelen said. \u201cA couple months after we went live with Longview Tax, I did another survey to ask how much time users estimated they saved. The majority responded that there was up to 25 to 50% less time spent.\u201d\nMore Flexibility\nLongview Tax has empowered Vanderlande with the flexibility of features custom-tailored to their company, which can grow and change at the speed of business.\nAfter implementing the product, Sebastiaan found that a specific journal entry item needed a different system set up. Thankfully, Longview is a very flexible tool and Taxvibes was easily able to configure the required functionality without additional costs.\nThrough Longview Tax, Vanderlande now enjoys centralized tax information, more efficient and automated processes, and robust data management. Going forward, the business has plans to implement Longview Transfer Pricing to further automate their business processes.\n"

        "content": "\n\nThe Heineken Group is one of the world\u2019s greatest brewers with 140 breweries in more than 70 countries, and a global network of distributors. While \u2018Heineken\u2019 is the principal international brand, the Heineken Group also brews and sells over 200 beers and ciders. Of the 125 million hectoliters sold by Heineken in 2009, approximately 14% was produced by Heineken Netherlands Supply (HNS) in 3 breweries in the Netherlands. In these 3 breweries, more than 900 SKUs are produced on 30 packaging lines and sold to over 150 countries.\nChallenges\nThe management and staff members of HNS were looking for a more effective way to answer the myriad of ad-hoc questions that arose every day.\nQuestions such as:\n\nHow to reduce working capital?\nHow to improve departure schedule conformance for vessels from the Port of Rotterdam?\nWhich delivery type produces the largest carbon footprint?\n\nThe objectives of HNS are to ensure that the business is:\n\nMore effective \u2013 through doing the right things, and\nMore efficient \u2013 through doing the right things in the right way\n\n\n\nWe use Angles for SAP for nearly every process\u2026It empowers our operating companies with self-service BI, and shows them where they can save a lot of money.\nLeonard Stein\nHeineken International\n\nSolution\nHeineken and Angles for SAP\nHeineken implemented Angles for SAP\u2019s standard Operational Performance Management add-on, having initially used Angles for SAP to improve their data quality, data reliability and to quickly obtain difficult-to-access SAP data. Angles for SAP provides Heineken\u2019s management team with the ability to quickly track, evaluate and understand the results of these KPIs, compare the performance with pre-set targets, and slice and dice the data using the dashboard\u2019s powerful and intuitive drill-down functionality.\nOne unexpected and almost immediate side-effect from Angles for SAP\u2019s use at Heineken was the rapid improvement in the user\u2019s perception of, and attitude toward, SAP. Users suddenly saw the benefit of the SAP system more clearly and understood better how to manage it in a way that helps Heineken to effectively execute their daily processes.\nS&OP and the Angles for SAP KPI Dashboard\nHeineken found significant benefit from Angles for SAP is in supporting their Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) process. Angles for SAP\u2019s KPI Dashboard provides Heineken with the ability to easily access multiple input KPIs via an (internal) website of HNS. These KPIs include multiple stock overviews, customer service levels, supply chain lead times, and forecast accuracy and bias. These types of KPIs are usually notorious for being difficult to reach a consensus on how they should be interpreted and analyzed. Through using the new Angles for SAP ETL toolset, this wasn\u2019t an issue, and it was solved with minimal effort. Now, Angles for SAP provides an overview of the most important KPIs in Heineken Netherlands that is subsequently presented at the S&OP meeting as a balanced scorecard.\n\n\nAngles for SAP and the KPI Dashboard help the management of the breweries to get a better grip on the overall performance of the supply chain, which will ultimately help Heineken Netherlands to service its domestic and international customers better against lower cost.\nFred Holvast\nLogistics Director at Heineken Netherlands\n\nResults\nIn summary, Heineken obtained the following benefits from using Angles for SAP:\n\nPositive ROI from Angles for SAP achieved in weeks\nIncreased business user acceptance and use of the SAP system\nStronger grip on the overall performance of the supply chain\nBetter insights into the integrated supply chain process\nSignificant and immediate cash saving opportunities \u2013 without further expenditure\nImproved reliability in master data and transactional data\n\nIt also helped to support HNS\u2019 two primary objectives, as follows:\n1. Helping them be more effective (do the right things) by:\n\nPre-setting required service and quality levels\nBeing the best in class for new product introductions (i.e., cost level and time to market).\n\n2. Helping them be more efficient (do the right things right) by:\n\nBeing the best in class for productivity\nEnsuring sustained low (transfer) prices\nReducing working capital\n\n\n\nThe successful implementation of Angles for SAP has had many positive effects. Staff members now have a more accurate and up to date view of the achieved performance of HNS, which has motivated them to realize good scores. I also expect that the increased understanding of the relationship between the different KPIs will lead to a continuous optimization cycle.\nAnton De Romijn\nStrategic Supply Chain Analyst at HNS\n\n\u00a0\n"

        "content": "\nData That Saves Lives \nBCA is a cooperative of independent blood centers that operate an online blood exchange website that helps centers manage and communicate operations across the member network. The website\u2019s interface uses the embedded analytics layer from Logi Symphony, from insightsoftware. BCA\u2019s focus is on matching the demand with the supply to meet the needs of lifecare centers all over the country. Greg explains further, \u201cWhether it\u2019s finding a market for their product or helping to determine where they can source it, BCA has set up the how-tos. We basically provide these centers with what they might need to fulfill their mission.\u201d\nLogi Symphony has been helpful in creating an easy-to-use system that has been fully operationalized in order to \u201cmake lives happen.\u201d\nThe Past and the Present \nBCA has been working with Logi Symphony for over fifteen years. BCA has built a data infrastructure wherein data enters the SQL server through Logi Symphony. The IT department configures the ELT (Extract Load and Transfer) systems to speak to each other and merge the data within Logi Symphony.\nBCA\u2019s needs have evolved over time, as has the partnership. In the early days, members had requested an abundance of metrics. Due to the large amount of information and complexity in its structure, data overwhelm began to settle in. For BCA, having the ability to surface and visualize that data in a meaningful way with Logi Symphony is a major improvement.\n\n\u201cLogi Symphony is integral in supporting communications with our members. We track the inventory for over 50 blood centers.\u201d Greg Bishop, VP of Information Services, Blood Centers of America.\nWith the dashboards they\u2019ve created using Logi Symphony, BCA can manage collections, distributions, and inventory levels. The way it works is that a member goes into the dashboard and posts a need for blood. The \u201cneed\u201d is then matched with the \u201cexcess\u201d in the system. For the person or center on the outside, it all looks seamless and effortless.\nLeveling Up to Fight the Pandemic \nBCA was enlisted to help people in the early stage of the pandemic. There arose an important national effort to collect plasma from donors who had recently had COVID. This program to attract and educate COVID survivors and collect donations, was called \u201cCOVID-19 Convalescent Plasma,\u201d or CCP.\nFor BCA, the CCP program vastly changed the status quo for their IT department. Practically overnight, BCA was to work with centers outside of their 50-member partner network who had to be educated in how to communicate with the dashboards. Greg shared, \u201cI just love the fact that something as simple as an email report goes out every night to people that we never dealt with before in all different roles.\u201d\nThe BCA collected an impressive 717,000 doses of plasma. The new connections resulted in a significant increase in volume and with that, a huge amount of processing. It added complexities and demanded enhanced tech efforts. Greg cites, \u201cSo this was a whole new animal. It was totally different than anything we\u2019d ever done before.\u201d\nFor starters, the reporting of key metrics was needed at both regional and national levels. This was a tremendous and new responsibility. Also new was the increase in \u201cplayers\u201d in the operation. There were new stakeholders from the government, hospitals, blood collectors, and blood banks. On a given day, there might be reporting needed from 70+ blood collectors. All of these reports were made possible by Logi Symphony.\nWith the increase in dashboard users, there was a subsequent increase in screens, data processing overhead, and the volumes of transfer in and out of different systems. Logi Symphony was essential to the exporting of data out of various systems. \u201cWe processed over 39K invoice lines on the Collection of CCP and the software better enabled us to account for these in our back-office work,\u201d said Greg. Technically speaking, on the back-end, BCA operates on the SQL server and data comes in the form of CSV files that need to be consolidated. \u201cBCA was able to help facilitate/coordinate collections and help ensure that COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was available for use in treating patients with the virus \u2014 while helping to maintain a secure and stable supply of blood and plasma for hospitals,\u201d said Greg.\n\u00a0\nAbout Blood Centers of America \nBCA is a cooperative of blood centers. Meaning, one of their primary functions is as a group purchasing organization. When a client group needs to buy products, they buy through BCA\u2019s contracts. The advantage is that they can buy in much larger volumes versus on their own.\nBCA covers over 50-member blood centers in the US. Headquartered in West Warwick, Rhode Island, BCA provides many services for their centers. One of its biggest initiatives currently is to recruit and retain new donors to BCA\u2019s many locales. BCA claims locations throughout the United States. They are an established organization and have been sourcing blood supplies for the past thirty years.\n\nDuring these times, it is rewarding to work with companies that are making a difference. Blood Centers of America (BCA) is an organization that is intent on saving lives. \u201cBCA has been Nationally recognized by several different industry organizations for their efforts around its CCP support during the Pandemic.\u201d BCA partnered with insightsoftware to move from manual data exports and spreadsheets to more streamlined and scalable automated processes. BCA\u2019s small but mighty IT department combined with insightsoftware\u2019s heavy lifting brought about 100% success. VP of Information Services, Blood Centers of America, Greg Bishop proclaims,\n"

        "content": "\n\nPR\u00dcFTECHNIK is an innovative German company with more than 600 employees working in its corporate divisions, and subsidiaries worldwide. With extensive R&D operations PR\u00dcFTECHNIK offers innovative solutions to customers in machine alignment, condition monitoring, and nondestructive testing. Established in 1972 by Dieter Busch, PR\u00dcFTECHNIK is a family-owned business now under the second-generation stewardship of Dr. Sebastian Busch and serves over 70 countries.\nChallenges\nTo become more agile in data operations, PR\u00dcFTECHNIK was looking for to automate SAP data. At the same time, the team was hoping to automate processes, and allow for reengineering of master data. In 2017, PR\u00dcFTECHNIK planned a migration to SAP S/4HANA with the Senior SAP Consultant, Dr. H.-J Schwieger, leading the migration project. Whatever tools they would choose should also help them with this project.It was a tall order, but when a colleague of Schwieger\u2019s recommended Magnitude Process Runner, it didn\u2019t take long to realize this was the magic tool they were looking to acquire. They looked at other products, but, \u201cWe tested Process Runner for two weeks, then ordered a license. The choice was that simple.\u201d PR\u00dcFTECHNIK quickly knew they had something. In addition to enabling agile data management processes and automation, it could also be the tool to lead the reengineering efforts of the master data structure.PR\u00dcFTECHNIK applications range from condition monitoring, geometrical alignment over nondestructive testing to turbine alignment and vibration analysis in over a dozen industries, ranging from automotive, chemical and food & beverage, to wind and marine. The company uses SAP daily for logistics such as production planning, financials, and sales and distribution to manage the global business. Business divisions operate independently and benefit from central services of the holding company. This streamlined organizational structure allows the organization to operate efficiently in the world market. It\u2019s also how PR\u00dcFTECHNIK\u2019s data management is structured.\n\nSolution\nMigration to S/4HANA: The Big Move\nMany companies are anxious to migrate to S/4HANA to take advantage of the digital world. PR\u00dcFTECHNIK wanted to get there as well, so they planned a complete conversion of the existing SAP Business Suite system to SAP S/4HANA. To successfully implement S/4HANA on-premises edition and reap the benefits of the efficiencies, Dr. H.-J. Schwieger and his team were interested in how to do this the very best way. Questions they had in planning included: Can we gain new efficiencies across our organization with this migration to S/4HANA? Could we reengineer our master data in Excel as we uploaded the data universes into S/4HANA by using Process Runner? Could we mass reassign new numbers to all material master data with this migration? The answer in every case was a resounding \u2018yes\u2019.\nSchwieger described the migration to S/4HANA as a process in which what could or should have been very complex was relatively simple with Process Runner. \u201cWhen we began using Process Runner to migrate to S/4HANA we had one repeated scenario that was applied to each process. It was reengineering data with our migration to S/4HANA. First, we would download the master data from SAP ERP by Process Runner. Then, using Excel, we would make the customizations and upload the new changes. For example, material master data was augmented with the MRP Process and Product Planning information. Then we\u2019d upload the Excel tables with the re-engineered master data to S/4HANA by Process Runner through assigning new numbers to the new material master data. It\u2019s been that simple for us,\u201d remarks Dr. Schwieger. \u201cProcess Runner is fast, so changes occur in seconds.\u201d\nPR\u00dcFTECHNIK works with a highly sophisticated SAP Solution for PP/SD Variant Conguration. Before they started the migration, they took time to disaggregate all business processes, about 40 in total. They migrated the master data for each Variant Conguration Model separately to fully understand how it worked. The reengineering process is clearly arranged and comprehensible for everyone. Schwieger said he\u2019s glad he took the extra time upfront to improve the processes and data. It\u2019s made such a great difference in PR\u00dcFTECHNIK\u2019s business already.\n\u201cPR\u00dcFTECHNIK did this same simple routine for around 40 common processes within our SAP team. This remarkable accomplishment within a migration process widely improved operation at PR\u00dcFTECHNIK,\u201d Schwieger deduced. PR\u00dcFTECHNIK accomplished the goal set out to get the best practices and an improved reengineered set of processes. By taking this disaggregate approach and putting Process Runner at the center of new data management processes on SAP S/4HANA made it all possible.\n\n"

        "content": "\n\n\nMcCorkle Nurseries saved three days of budgeting work per month\nCut down its cashflow and forecast planning process from three weeks to a couple of hours\nGave users the autonomy to input information instead of emailing around the company\nCut budget process by a full month annually\nLeveraged the advantage of real-time information\n\nMcCorkle Nurseries is a full-service grower of fine plants for both the retail and wholesale nursery industries, as well as for landscaping professionals across the Southeastern United States. Since 1942, the company has been dedicated to providing customers with the right plant, at the right time, and for the right price, while offering high quality customer service.\nMcCorkle Mastered Jet and Wanted More \nMcCorkle Nurseries is a unique business in the nursery and greenhouse industry in that they sell shrubs purchased from across the United States while also growing its own plants. Because the product is live, it\u2019s vital for McCorkle Nurseries to keep close track of the process in the 18 months to three years that it takes the plants to grow enough to become ready for sale.\nAfter being with its former ERP since 2000, McCorkle made the switch to Microsoft Dynamics Business Central (BC). Three months after implementing its new ERP, McCorkle Nurseries began using insightsoftware\u2019s Jet Reports for its advanced operational and financial reporting capabilities in Microsoft Excel. Jet Reports empowered Tara Pounds, Accounting Manager with McCorkle Nurseries, to leverage the familiar interface of Excel by pulling templates and formulas she was already using.\n\u201cOne of the things that led to the decision to go with Jet Reports was that the fact that it was Excel-based,\u201d Pounds said. \u201cI took existing templates and just went in and updated formulas to pull from the general ledger.\u201d\nEventually, the business ran into challenges with its budgeting and planning process, which leaned heavily on multiple spreadsheets made by legacy employees including a previous CFO.\nLeadership was able to make decisions, but they needed to double, triple, and sometimes quadruple check numbers. If they found an error along the way, it was time-consuming to fix\u2013and Pounds often handled these complicated tasks alone.\n\u201cWe were not pulling information directly from the ERP system,\u201d said Pounds. \u201cThere was a lot of human interaction. That was ultimately the goal, to get everything tied to where it\u2019s pulling information directly from the ERP so that there\u2019s as little human interaction as possible.\u201d\nWhen the company hired a new CFO, it was time for a change. With the goal of pulling information directly from its ERP system and reducing human error, the business looked to Bizview for help with its budgeting and planning needs.\nPlan for Success with Bizview and Jet \nBefore implementing Bizview, McCorkle had a multitude of unconnected systems. After demoing a range of different planning and budgeting solutions, the company chose Bizview. The two crucial factors in this decision were that Bizview integrates seamlessly with Jet Reports while offering competitive pricing.\n\u201cWhat led us to Bizview was the fact that we were already with Jet Reports,\u201d said Pounds. \u201cWe were considering another option who would not have had that connection with Jet Reports and we wanted to tie everything together, Dynamics BC, Jet, and Bizview. The pricing was also very competitive, but the biggest thing was the connectivity between all programs which we look forward to utilizing fully in the future.\u201d\nIts intuitive connectivity effortlessly solved the problem of struggling with multiple, disparate pieces of software.\nBizview, combined with Jet, offered the company a variety of advantages, including:\n\nShortening reporting cycles\nSpeeding up variance analysis\nGaining deeper visibility into planning processes\nAccessing real-time data\n\nSeamless Implementation \nMcCorkle began to implement Bizview in June of 2021, launching a kick-off and design phase. Pounds worked closely with insightsoftware staff throughout the process, meeting once or twice a week.\nBy October of the same year, the business kicked off its budget 2022 planning process. And within six months, Bizview was up and running, even after nearly two decades of working with their previous system.\n\u201cI worked very closely with our insightsoftware engineers to develop a solution that would solve our needs,\u201d said Pounds. \u201cI gave them our multitude of spreadsheets and we just went from there. I was so impressed that it took less far less time than expected to get it up and going.\u201d\nResults \nSignificantly Shorter Reporting Cycles\nBy automatically combining plan and live actuals in one Excel report, Jet and Bizview dramatically reduced McCorkle\u2019s reporting cycle. Pounds can easily add Bizview data into existing reports or create new reports in minutes. Eliminating time-consuming, error-prone data dumps has accelerated time-critical processes at McCorkle. With a faster process, Pounds can create more budget versions and analyze variances more frequently to improve budget and forecast accuracy.\n\u201cBecause everything is in one central location within Bizview, we have the different input forms that feed data up into and build balance sheets, P&L, and cashflow forecasts. Accuracy increases because you\u2019re only entering it in one spot.\u201d Pounds explained. \u201cYou\u2019re not entering it into multiple spots, worrying about someone going in and zeroing out a formula somewhere or bouncing information back and forth.\u201d\n\u201cJet and Bizview have completely changed my reporting process. What used to take months before Bizview, now takes a few weeks. This year, the CFO has given me the goal of completing the 2023 budget from start to finish in two weeks, where we did it in two to three months previously.\u201d\nA Boost in Collaboration\nBizview revolutionized McCorkle Nurseries\u2019 budgeting and planning posture by granting the business the ability to make real-time changes within Bizview that feed into all forms and reports they use. Before the implementation, Pounds would attend planning meetings and take copious notes. Afterward, she would update spreadsheets so that leadership could see the changes that occurred during their meeting.\nWith Bizview\u2019s interactive capabilities, Pounds can now update data during the same meetings and leadership will see her alterations immediately, saving two days\u2019 worth of data entry.\n\u201cDuring budget meetings with managers, the CFO, and CEO, I have everything up on my screen and I can make changes while the CFO looks at them. It is huge for us.\u201d\nSped up Variance Analysis\nBizview\u2019s ability to work together with insightsoftware\u2019s Jet suite of products has allowed McCorkle to streamline its processes and nurture better software integration throughout the business. With the addition of Bizview, Pounds and her CFO can analyze granular data within Microsoft Dynamics. They can drill down into balances at a transactional level and immediately address any variances, rather than waiting for them to be picked up later in the process.\n\u201cThe complete budgeting and planning process was taking two to three months. And we were not always complete by the end of the actual calendar year. Going into the following year, we were still making adjustments or changes to the budget several weeks into the year we were budgeting,\u201d said Pounds. \u201cJust gathering and inputting information for the cash flow forecast would take the CFO two to three weeks. Then he\u2019d have to do his scenario modelling on top of that. This year, with him using Bizview, it took him less than an hour to review and several hours when adjusting different scenarios. Cutting our time spent down by 90% easily.\u201d\nDeeper Visibility into Planning Processes\nWith Jet and Bizview, McCorkle enjoys easy access to data from any Microsoft Dynamics module. It can create reports that automatically track financial and operational plans without relying on IT. The combined strength of both products provides Pounds and the wider McCorkle team with immediate access to all the actuals data they need to reforecast more frequently and more accurately.\n"

        "company": "Absorb Software",
        "content": "\nIntroduction\nSince 2003, Absorb Software, located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, has made strides to eliminate the suffering caused by lackluster Learning Management Systems (LMS), not only in learners but in administrators who were tasked with creating learning environments that matched the sophistication and complexity of their organizations. For 15 years (and counting), they\u2019ve been building thoughtfully designed software that supports all learning by reflecting and anticipating their clients\u2019 needs.\nIn the ten years before launching their flagship LMS, Absorb Software maintained a division to build great courses. As their client base grew, they quickly recognized the corporate world required massive quantities of people to be certified promptly and\nefficiently, with minimal administrative overhead attached. This led the organization to begin to develop an LMS that was:\n\n\u2026 dedicated to the commonly underestimated learning needs of the forgotten masses of corporate learners.\n\nBy 2013, Absorb Software\u2019s LMS (Absorb LMS) had blossomed into a highly sophisticated software and was used by hundreds of clients worldwide, which drove the business to focus solely on the LMS and begin phasing out course development.\nNeeds\nAbsorb Software works one-on-one with their clients\u2019 LMS Administrators to better understand how they\u2019re using Absorb LMS, and to determine what goals they\u2019re looking to achieve through the reporting system. Initially, Absorb Software identified the need to provide their LMS administrators more direct access to their data. However, as their client base grew, they found an increasing demand for enhanced customization to the reporting functionality. Absorb Software\u2019s clients clamored for the ability to gather actionable insights from the LMS, to bring-to-life their own specific reporting design and functionality.\nTo further illustrate this, Absorb\u2019s clients had requested unique data layouts as well as greater interactivity within their reporting environment, to better consume and analyze their data. With a growing client-base in a diverse range of industries, and a highly flexible software with a wide range of workflows, the challenge of building generic reports that cover all of their clients\u2019 unique needs demanded an expansion beyond Absorb\u2019s already rich suite of standard reporting options.\nSolution\nAbsorb Software believed that every choice their clients made should be informed, and every action measurable. They recognized that every business is unique, and each comes with its own set of particular reporting needs, leading them to create a BI module by\nembedding Logi Symphony into their LMS (Absorb LMS). Absorb Software employed a multi-tenancy scenario where they could effortlessly create and manage their clients, each separate from one another, and presented them with a rich suite of reporting options that are custom-built to their specific needs.\nIn addition to providing their clients with a library of ready made, interactive dashboards by incorporating Logi Symphony into their LMS, Absorb Software acquired the ability to offer highly customized reporting, as well as customizable visual representations of data to match the unique context of each client.\nWhy Absorb Software Chose Absorb Logi Symphony\n\nHighly Customizable Dashboards\nLogi Symphony\u2019s fully customizable visualizations enabled Absorb Software to tailor each dashboard to the client\u2019s specific requirements. Even the client\u2019s branding was taken into account, helping to create genuinely professional and personal dashboard views, upping the wow-factor.\nMulti-Tenancy Deployment\nLogi Symphony\u2019s built-in support for multi-tenant deployment scenarios allowed Absorb Software to easily create and manage their 100+ tenants, each isolated from another under a single deployment. Each tenant is also able to assign an administrator, who can further customize the offering, without relying on Absorb Software\u2019s services.\nAutomated Reports Generation\n\u201cWe got really excited with interactive dashboards, but it never really occurred to us that Logi Symphony could be so useful in regards to printed reports.\u201d Logi Symphony\u2019s reporting tool provides unique capabilities that allow Absorb Software to\nautomate the entire reporting process for their clients from the point where end users select or enter data, to the point where a report is automatically generated.\nOptimized Data Retrieval\nAbsorb Software uses highly parameterized queries within Logi Symphony, to ensure efficient queries are sent back to the database instead of being forced to store the data for each of their tenants in a secondary storage.\nSuperb User Interactivity\nAbsorb Software thoroughly enjoyed Logi Symphony\u2019s built-in filtering and navigation, as well as powerful drill-downs, through an easy-to-use interface.\n\nKey Benefits\n\n\n\nAbsorb Software benefits from saving on complex system maintenance and avoiding duplicated work efforts as Logi Symphony automatically adjusts to whoever is using the BI module. Absorb Software offers custom reporting to their clients, where they\u2019ll write applications that provide flat files at weekly intervals. With potentially hundreds of different recipients, each with their own unique permissions models, there needed to be a way to filter data to whoever is looking at the LMS\u2019 business intelligence module. Using Logi Symphony\u2019s multi-tenancy deployment, Absorb Software yielded the option to use dynamic data connections, and custom attributes to filter data by user/tenant, based on the tenant login. Now, Absorb Software\u2019s clients can enter the LMS, filter on courses, instructors, etc., and perform interactive, exploratory analysis directly in their data without any concern of exposure to records outside of their permissions.The alternative would have seen everyone receiving the same CSV files or Absorb Software being forced to build and maintain hundreds/thousands of different file exports.\nAbsorb Software welcomed immediate return on investment with several government contracts where paper-based record keeping was a priority. They were able to build highly customized printable forms containing user transcript information that would otherwise have seen supervisors manually extracting scores, statuses, and dates from a number of areas in the LMS. Their clients save time preparing routine reports and were able to print and store them, which was a massive benefit for the clients meaning higher satisfaction rates out of Absorb Software.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nLastly, Absorb Software has provided their clients with cutting-edge, interactive visualizations that drive business-critical insights. As a SaaS hosted solution, Absorb Software caters to a wide variety of client sizes, and has been optimized to remain performant under the most demanding situations. Customized dashboards offered a way for Absorb to work 1-on-1 with some of their largest clients to reimagine ways in which to return a reasonable volume of data while\nalso staying aligned with the clients\u2019 individual, ad-hoc reporting needs.\n\nFinal Statements\nUltimately, Logi Symphony armed Absorb LMS with a BI module that ensures Absorb Software\u2019s client\u2019s satisfaction by significantly augmenting the capabilities of reporting elements in the Absorb admin interface.\n"

        "content": "\nCritical security data to protect against malicious activity\nCybersecurity is crucial for companies that need to protect their data privacy, information security, and daily operations. Despite companies having data security measures in place, cyber criminals have increased their attempts to steal information and sabotage or damage operations. To stay ahead of these threats and avoid costly breaches, companies trust CyberMaxx to handle their cybersecurity expertise and technology.\nCyberMaxx provides cybersecurity operations services that help these companies prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks and has been doing so for over 15 years. CyberMaxx generates vast amounts of data, including the source and type of attack, the number of attacks from month to month, and how the attack was contained. Their customers rely and report on this information to monitor their cybersecurity efforts and maintain industry compliance.\nFor example, for CyberMaxx\u2019s many healthcare customers, having these capabilities within their security layer is critical for HIPAA compliance and proof of HITRUST. With all this data, CyberMaxx\u2019s application lacked an engaging way to present it to their customers. Jason Riddle, the Chief Operations Officer of CyberMaxx, stated, \u201cWe were sitting on a treasure trove of cybersecurity data focused on the healthcare industry but didn\u2019t have a way to unlock\u00a0 it. By having that capability, our customers could gain greater visualization, insights, and value from that data.\u201d\nPowerful visualizations to bring data to life\nCyberMaxx needed to bring their data into a dashboard that could tell their customers an intuitive story. They were looking to go beyond\u00a0 standard pie charts and bar graphs. Along with their healthcare customer advisory board, CyberMaxx defined their criteria to deliver a simple, yet powerful user experience.\nAt the top of their list, CyberMaxx wanted a solution that could provide various filters and visual reporting options for customers to actively engage with their data. By having more detailed reporting capabilities, their customers could thoroughly document their compliance with HIPAA or proof of HITRUST. Healthcare customers could also perform benchmarking to compare their own cybersecurity measures with companies in the industry of a similar size. Given this level of added value, CyberMaxx could increase customer adoption, usage, and\nretention rates.\nCyberMaxx wanted to give their customers strong visualizations so they could interact more with their data. For example, hospitals, which are frequently targeted by ransomware attacks, could gain greater insights into an attack, identify the threat actor, and\nefficiently respond to it. On the back end, CyberMaxx was looking for a seamless embedded experience. Their Chief\nExecutive Officer Thomas Lewis added, \u201cWe wanted a platform that would integrate easily with ours and our technology stack. So, we had to find a vendor that had the right mix of providing a cost-effective solution and a high-degree of confidence in their ability to deliver on what they promised.\u201d\nEmbedded analytics expertise to elevate user experience\nCyberMaxx had the cybersecurity know-how, but they didn\u2019t have data analytics expertise. They needed a partner that could unlock their data,\ngenerating greater insights for their end users. For CyberMaxx, no other embedded analytics provider could compare to Logi Analytics. Lewis\nsaid, \u201cFrom the sales process, to the proof of concept, to the cloud application integration, Logi Analytics instilled the level of confidence we were looking for in an analytics provider.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cWe wanted to find a partner, not necessarily a vendor, that could provide the expertise that we didn\u2019t have. We\u2019re cybersecurity\nexperts; we\u2019re not data scientists. Working with a group that could help us visualize the data in the easiest and most impactful way was important to us. And we wanted a partner that was one of the\u00a0 leading providers so we could be confident that we were getting the best of breed in an innovative embedded analytics platform.\u201d\n\u201cLogi Analytics had the resources and expertise we needed. We felt like their partner through the entire process, and not just another client. This experience helped set our expectations for how it would be to work with them as a customer. It was a good fit for us,\u201d Riddle added.\nAnother big selling point was Logi Analytics professional services to help with the implementation. Riddle said, \u201cWe had a vague idea of the requirements for our analytics solution. They had an unending amount of patience in helping us shape it into a clear solution that we could be proud of.\u201d CyberMaxx relied on the professional services team\u2019s expertise to help determine the right visualization for the right data set.\nRiddle said that, on several occasions, they provided suggestions based on tried and true practices that worked better than CyberMaxx could have imagined.\nThe professional services team suggested ways CyberMaxx could generate greater engagement with their customers. Riddle explains, \u201cFor example, if a customer doesn\u2019t use a particular service, we can hide the chart. Or to take it a step further, we can show a message indicating that no data is available for the visualization and they can contact us if they\u2019d like to add it. It turns into an opportunity to provide customers more value and more engagement with our team.\u201d\nData and dashboards to power the cybersecurity application\nWith the Logi Symphony suite of services, CyberMaxx can now embed powerful data analytics, reporting, and visualization capabilities into their MAXX Data Defense Systems suite of managed services. CyberMaxx was able to customize the dashboards to match their own branding, creating a cohesive experience for their end users. In doing so, they equip their security team and customers with the threat visibility and actionable data insights that are the dierence between partner safety and business disruption.\nBy using the Logi Symphony suite of solutions, CyberMaxx can leverage their existing technology stack to connect to any data source and provide customized analytics in their application. They can also use it for their own internal-facing dashboards so their team can identify data insights for operating effectiveness.

        "company": "Lima Memorial",
        "content": "\n\nNearly half of all organizations say cloud-based business intelligence (BI) solutions are either critical or very important to their operations, according to a 2019 State of BI study. Features like advanced visualization, ad-hoc query support, personalized dashboards, and ETL tools are the primary requirements driving this sentiment.\nAnd while there are plenty of BI solutions that promise those features out of the box, the reality is that they often fall short in terms of customizability and control. Instead, organizations like Lima Memorial Hospital rely on spreadsheet-based operations to collect data and run BI reports.\n\u201cWhen I first joined Lima Memorial, the hospital used basic spreadsheets for a lot of its reports,\u201d said Stephanie June Dray, Sr. Business Intelligence Developer at Lima Memorial. \u201cI have a love/hate relationship with spreadsheets for BI. When you\u2019re trying to manipulate data and generate operational insights, there\u2019s too much room for mistakes.\u201d\nAt another company, Dray used Logi Symphony to implement a wide array of dashboards that helped leaders identify and capitalize on opportunities to streamline operations and cut costs. Dray said that she \u201cloved using Logi Symphony. We used dashboards for every little thing. I recommended it for Lima when I joined and now we\u2019re building out custom dashboards here.\u201d\nThe Power of Custom Dashboards\nIt\u2019s critical that BI leaders make data actionable as quickly as possible. \u201cYou need BI tools that will help you build the end results your organization needs,\u201d said Dray. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to wade through pages and pages of spreadsheet data to figure out where there are opportunities and what needs to be done.\u201d\nOne way that Lima Memorial has used Logi Symphony is to create a custom bed management system. Using embedded analytics, Dray built dashboards that integrated patient information with floor layouts at the hospital. As a result, medical leaders and hospital executives can get a quick overview of where actions are needed and prioritize them effectively. This system now helps Lima Memorial leaders answer a variety of operational questions, including:\n\nIs there a patient in the room?\nHas the room been cleaned?\nHow long did it take to clean the room?\nIs the room ready for use?\nIf a patient is in the room, has a medical recommendation been completed?\nHow long did it take staff to discharge a patient?\nAre we keeping up with routine check-ins with a patient?\n\nThe custom bed management system enables Lima Memorial to improve operations by identifying inefficiencies faster and enabling a more proactive approach to staffing needs.\n\u201cWhen my colleagues came back from a HIMMS conference, they were excited about many of the new BI solutions,\u201d said Dray. \u201cThose costly solutions promise a lot of great features but wouldn\u2019t necessarily fit into the hospital\u2019s existing information architecture. The robust functionality in Logi Symphony is a gamechanger because it allows me to build custom systems that save us so much money.\u201d\nData Analytics That Doesn\u2019t Sacrifice Security\nSmall hospitals like Lima Memorial can\u2019t afford to sink a significant amount of money into a third-party BI tool only to find that it doesn\u2019t offer the flexibility to fit unique operational use cases. \u201cInstead of buying a pre-built system for $500,000 and then having to figure out how to reconfigure everything, Logi Symphony gives us the flexibility to build dashboards and analyze data in the most efficient ways possible for our use cases.\u201d\nAll of this analytical power can\u2019t come at the cost of security, though\u2014especially at a hospital that faces strict compliance requirements.\n\u201cSecurity in Logi Symphony is the best,\u201d said Dray. \u201cWe can put security measure in place all the way down to the data level, which is essential for us as we ensure our dashboards and systems are PHI compliant.\u201d\nSummary\nWith the help of an internal BI leader, Lima Memorial has been able to make the most of Logi Symphony\u2019s customization to build dashboards and systems that uncover valuable operational insights. Combined with the cost savings from not investing in a pre-built solution, Lima Memorial has seen short-term ROI that will compound as more use cases are built out.\n"

        "content": "\nThe Solution\nFollowing their intense investigation into BI applications, Boston College Libraries found the solution to meet their mobile BI needs in Logi Symphony.\n\u201cBoston College University Libraries selected Logi Symphony because it offered us a business intelligence solution that we could implement quickly with just one developer, has a real strength when it comes to distributing information through interactive reports, self-service reporting, and mobile applications; and had a licensing model allowing us to affordably serve thousands of users,\u201d remarked Mr. Gerrity.\nImplementation of the mobile application took approximately two months with one developer, and involved bringing in data from three different applications, all running Oracle databases.\nThe first application developed by Boston College University Libraries, using Logi Symphony technology, allows students to use their mobile devices to access confidential library account information, browse library catalogues, and place holds on library resources. A second mobile application built and deployed allows librarians equipped with iPads to create lists of library resources to be re-shelved or removed by library volunteers. They were able to create mobile menus, interactive reports showing resources available, tailor to courses that individual students are enrolled in, offer study room booking, catalog search, and even computer lab availability graphs.\nThe Results\nBoston College University Libraries mobile solution delivers information that reaches more than 14,000 students, in addition to 120 librarians and 1,000 faculty members. Students and faculty can now access library services from anywhere, on campus or around the world, from any device.\nMr. Gerrity, commented, \u201cGetting the application onto a wide variety of mobile devices quickly, with minimal development effort, and without having to use an app store is a tremendous value and convenience to IT and our students.\u201dFrom their phones, tablets, and personal computers, library patrons access a variety of library resources and services, including the ability to book study rooms, which has increased overall visitor utilization. They are able to instantly access an interactive and personalized view of information and resources that are relevant to them, whenever, and wherever they are. The deployment of the mobile application fully supports and complements the components of the University Libraries mission statement of:\n\nProviding access to the highest quality scholarly/information resources and services whenever and wherever the users need them\nProviding leadership and expertise to faculty and students in the creation and dissemination of scholarship in a digital format\nImproving the physical and virtual environment in order to support user self-sufficiency and productivity\nDeveloping an organization that facilitates operational flexibility and fosters collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement\n\nThe college has been able to easily and securely deliver BI to a large number of end users, regardless of where they are and what mobile device they are using. With Logi Symphony, Boston College University Libraries have been able to continue their innovative approach to delivering interactive library services that support academic success.\n"

        "company": "Pathway Chicken",
        "content": "\nPathway Chicken has been able to save more than $2.4 million annually by using analytic dashboards from Logi Symphony to better respond to real-time data.\nWith sales close to $5 billion and customers in more than 100 countries, Pathway Chicken is one of the top three producers of poultry products in North America. Their largest complex, presented here is a raw, cook, and distribution plant, where the product enters the production cycle and is processed through a vacuum to marinade, dusted, battered, and cooked. Three shifts work around the clock to produce over 300,000+ pounds of product every day.\nThe Challenge\nProducers at Pathway\u2019s food processing plants make significant investments in equipment and systems used for packaging and data collection. At raw and cook plants, producers collect data on the number of units through each cycle, temperature, weight, packing, etc. in order to ensure a quality end product, minimize waste, and improve efficiency. To support its just-in-time (JIT) production strategy, Manufacturing Systems Application Development Manager, Ryan Matthews, needed to reduce the lag time between the point at which measurements were taken on the floor and when the data was presented back to the line, so workers could make necessary adjustments.\nTheir old reporting solution was a manual process that required many man hours and involved Excel and printed reports, often utilizing data more than a week old. Matthews knew that relying on stale data to improve hisplant\u2019s JIT productivity was highly inefficient, so he chose Logi Symphony to bridge the gap between their current systems and optimal strategy.\nThe Solution\nMatthews assembled a team that included his Complex IT Manager and Director of Plant Operations to solve the problem of faster data processing and presentation.\nThe team immediately took the approach of solving a business problem that would require a particular kind of technology to improve plant operations. They recognized the need to support a continuous flow of business requirements and processes to provide immediate access to the information to those working on the plant floor. Dashboards are an excellent way to present scannable, high-level information, and the team saw the need to present real-time information as plainly as possible so that workers could make immediate adjustments instead of spending a lot of time analyzing data.\nThe Results\n\u201cI like working in Logi Symphony. The interface is intuitive and it\u2019s a lot easier to write reports in than SSRS. Even before the training, I was able to build a couple dashboards. While they probably weren\u2019t done the best way possible, at least I got some visual results within a couple hours of having the software. I found Logi Symphony to be very user-friendly and for me it was great.\u201d\nAfter evaluating several business intelligence (BI) platforms, they chose Logi Symphony because of its agility,ease of use, fast time to implement, and web delivery model. The fact that Logi Symphony is 100% web-based enabled them to display dashboards via the browser on LCD monitors with NEMA4 encasing directly on the plant floor.\nThe team\u2019s first deliverable was a set of dashboards that displayed near real-time information on temperature, pick-up, weight, pack, etc. They used bold graphics and rich colors so that the dashboards would be easily adopted and consumed by workers on the line shift. By glancing at the large LCD displays, they could quickly determine if they were on target for any of management\u2019s key operational metrics.\nIn addition to displaying this information on the line, Pathway was also able to present the dashboards in the hallways, employee offices, even halfway across the world, since everything is accessible via the browser. This meant that stakeholders across the organization would be even more directly informed and involved in achieving these key objectives.\nWith a new solution in place, Matthews estimated that his plant is saving more than $2.4 million in yield annually by being able to better respond to real-time data in improving day-to-day operations. Logi Symphony has become the standard technology for manufacturing intelligence at Pathway Chicken, and teams are working on additional projects at eight other plants and functional areas.\n"

        "company": "Origami Risk",
        "content": "\n\nDue to Logi Symphony\u2019s intuitive design environment, Origami Risk was able to enter the market with a product in less than six months. Origami Risk embedded Logi Symphony in its product, which resulted in features for customers that included a customized interface, interactive reporting, and ad hoc report creation.\nOrigami Risk is an innovative provider of a full-featured risk management information system (RMIS). The company provides best in class, easy to use risk management technology with powerful features. The\u00a0Origami Risk RMIS tool enables managers of insurance risk to aggregate data and also provides sophisticated analysis to identify cost drivers. Reporting capabilities, therefore, are a key component of the product\u2019s value.\u00a0The Origami Risk product is deployed on the cloud and offers capabilities such as claims, incidents, and policies management, values tracking, reports and analysis, risk dashboards, and data updates.\nThe Challenge\nAs Origami Risk began to develop their innovative RMIS, they explored several possibilities for third party dashboards and reporting components. They quickly rejected Crystal Reports as it did not fit their web-based architecture. They also ruled out Business Objects because of the time and costs necessary to maintain the solution they wanted.\nAnd while Microsoft\u2019s SQL Reporting Services had some good capabilities, it lacked any impressive visual elements in the dashboards they wanted.\nThe Solution\nOrigami Risk selected Logi Symphony due to the XML-based architecture, flexibility, and selection of advanced dashboard visualizations.\n\u201cSpecifically, Logi Symphony\u2019s highly flexible user interface was important for us to make analytics easy for risk managers to use. We sell into a competitive market space, so the visual appearance of reports is important. We wanted to incorporate our own UI into embedded dashboards and reports to make things look a certain way and Logi Symphony provided a lot of flexibility in that regard,\u201d said Steve Fischer, CTO, Origami Risk.\nRather than have a separate report module, Origami Risk sought to seamlessly embed reporting capabilities into their product, so integration capabilities between the core product and Logi Symphony components were important.\nThe Results\nDue to Logi Symphony\u2019s intuitive design environment, Origami Risk was able to enter the market with a viable product in less than six months.\nUpon initial launch, the Origami Risk RMIS included 10 report templates and 10 dashboard panels, which has now grown to 50 report templates and 35 dashboard panels.\nCustomized Interface\nOrigami Risk focused on embedding Logi Symphony reports within the application in a way that is meaningful to a risk manager.\n\u201cOur goal was to always make it look like you\u2019re in Origami, even when parts of it were built in Logi Symphony. We didn\u2019t want to have you go elsewhere to a report module to run reports. If there are appropriate analytics for whatever you are working on, the analytics should be right there,\u201d stated Mr. Fischer.\nInteractive Reporting\nInsurance claims require a lot of data to be tracked, but individual risk managers want to track different items, so Origami Risk enabled extensive customization options. For example, the Comparison Report compares a selected claim to other similar claims.\nUsers can select fields from a list to generate a report that produces statistics related to those criteria, such as timeframe and geographical area. These criteria can be changed on the fly, which automatically prompts the report to update with the new parameters. Users can also drill through from Logi Symphony reports to other Origami Risk screens without knowing that they are utilizing two different applications.\nFinally, it was important to Origami Risk that dashboards be visually appealing. After creating various panels, graphs, and widgets, Origami Risk is pleased with their appearance. As risk managers care about different KPIs, the ability to provide a wide variety of panels was also important.\nSelf-Service Report Creation\nOrigami Risk provides a variety of pre-defined reports which include customization options, empowering less sophisticated users with a level of flexibility. Sophisticated users are also able to create custom reports.\nMr. Fischer explains: \u201cEvery risk manager is going to want to analyze data differently. We don\u2019t know in advance how many groupings the risk manager may want. We needed an interface that could dynamically create as many groupings on the fly as possible and then pass those groupings to Logi Symphony. We built a plug in to dynamically take and grab the XML definition right before it is run and add those groupings on the fly.\u201d\nOrigami Risk\u2019s architecture consists of a SQL Server database running on the Amazon cloud, which allows them to leverage all the scalability benefits of a cloud-based environment.\n\u201cRather than having to create multiple Logi reports, there is one Logi Symphony report template with a single log definition behind the scenes that we pass parameters to in order to change things on the fly. This consolidates the code and makes it easy to maintain and extend. Risk managers love Excel so we also take advantage of Symphony Excel export template,\u201d concluded Mr. Fischer.\n"

        "company": "Hastings Group",
        "content": "\nBackground\nHastings Group, a UK-based consumer insurance provider, commenced its IFRS 17 program in late 2020. Though slightly later to start than a number of its peers, with support from PwC, Hastings was able to accelerate its requirements definition process and execute a rapid market evaluation and vendor selection.\nStarting when it did, Hastings could consider software packages that were already developed for IFRS 17, compared with earlier adopters, which were faced with the alternatives of building in house or opting for a solution that was still being developed.\nA key requirement was for a non-disruptive solution that delivered IFRS 17 compliance \u2013 a minimum viable product, but one that also closely aligned with Hastings\u2019 cloud first strategy and modern data architecture.\nBy taking this approach, Hastings wanted to preserve the existing management reporting process, with no adverse impact on month end, whilst gaining the additional sub ledger data granularity and business insight required by IFRS 17. The target architecture would also improve end to end integration across all source and target systems. Like most insurance providers, Hastings uses a range of systems and a revised cloud platform is also being implemented as part of a firm wide data ecosystem.\nFunctionally, the solution needed to support the Group\u2019s insurance undertaking in Gibraltar and provide consolidated Group results under the IFRS 17 standard to its parent company \u2013 Sampo plc \u2013 in Finland.\nFastPost, a third generation SaaS accounting rules cloud platform, was chosen.\nCriteria for a Solution\nHastings had an ambitious technical roadmap and needed a vendor that would support its requirements. The Group required a cloud native SaaS solution that provided the flexibility to meet Hastings\u2019 functional needs but also provided the scalability to support its ambitious growth plans.\nAs well as processing the IFRS 17 actuals, Hastings wanted to use FastPost for calculating forecast information as input to the planning process. FastPost can apply user defined business rules for creating future period balances based on patterns. This can be applied to any balance, but Hastings particularly required forward looking views of amortization of acquisition costs over different renewal periods and recognition of commissions over policy terms.\nDelivery\nFastPost was deployed and configured within ten months. This enabled Hastings to complete its entire change and test process during 2021 and achieve \u201cgo live\u201d in December 2021. Hastings is now significantly ahead of many of its peers with IFRS 17 opening balances implemented and comparatives starting from the beginning of 2022.\nChallenges\nThe project had to adapt to the various moving parts of Hastings\u2019 broader ongoing data transformation program, and across all stakeholders including Finance, Actuarial, and IT.\nDigitally focused insurance providers like Hastings stay competitive by constantly updating their product offering. This meant the team needed to add new products during the implementation, including new home offerings and multi-car policies. FastPost\u2019s rules-based configuration allowed for the rapid onboarding of new products.\nData management is one of the major challenges of an IFRS 17 project, however Hastings already had good data controls in place. Unlike many insurance firms, Hastings was operating a modern PAS so had less reliance on multiple legacy systems. The data was already defined so the team was in good shape to focus on the granularity required for IFRS 17 reporting. That said, running a large data ecosystem transformation project in parallel meant that some pragmatic decisions needed to be taken to keep the project on track at times.\nBusiness Benefits\nWith FastPost, Hastings is building on the existing data ecosystem by providing another step in the integration between Finance and the rest of the business. The ability to deliver accounting validated data for both Finance and the wider business community provides significant benefit to the organization.\nHastings will benefit from FastPost\u2019s accounting rules engine and subledger, which were developed to give finance departments greater control and ownership of their accounting data, and, importantly, the ability for additional steps and analysis for IFRS 17 processing to be completed with no delay to the financial reporting timetable.\n"

        "company": "The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District",
        "content": "\n\nThe Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District\u2019s sole purpose is to protect public health and the environment. Everyday, this is accomplished by providing quality service to over one million people in 61 communities in the Greater Cleveland area. Three treatment plants\u2014Easterly, Southerly, and Westerly\u2014treat 240 million gallons of wastewater daily from homes and businesses, and return clean water to Lake Erie.\nChallenges\nThe Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District\u2019s IT Department implemented Oracle E-Business Suite to better serve the organization\u2019s Finance and Human Resources (HR) departments. As part of this implementation, the team also began to roll out Oracle Discoverer as a reporting engine since it came pre-packaged with the Oracle E-Business Suite of applications. However, initial feedback from the District\u2019s end-users confirmed that Discoverer was \u201ccomplex and cumbersome\u201d and not as user-friendly as expected. This made it a challenge for users who were not accustomed to creating reports they needed on their own.\n\u201cWe had our fair share of experiences with different reporting tools,\u201d said Humberto Sanchez, Manager of IT Project Management Services at the District. \u201cIn the past, we had resistance to adopt because some of these tools can be quite technical. What we came to find out within the IT Department is that it didn\u2019t matter what tool was used, that inherently the users need to have an understanding of their data and how to ultimately find it within their application\u2019s table structure. For example, they want a report that gives them a view of employee salaries and they know all the data labels for this, but when they looked at the Oracle tables or field names, data elements are presented without using common names, and are therefore very difficult for a user to identify.\u201d\nSanchez and his team determined that IT would have to closely collaborate with end-users to gather the information necessary to help the organization report, manage, and run smoothly. \u201cWe assumed there was no reporting tool out there that could magically prepare the report a user requested without a lot of customization and data mapping exercises.\u201d\nDuring this time a District business group member attended an Oracle Application User Group Conference and witnessed a demonstration of the Angles for Oracle technology. After connecting with other local organizations that use Angles for Oracle, the District\u2019s IT Department discovered they were not the only ones who struggled to obtain data from Oracle applications and that Angles for Oracle was a tool that could be very helpful to them.\nSolution\nThe initial Angles for Oracle roll-out was limited to users within the HR and Finance Departments who would be responsible for generating the necessary reports for their Departments and other internal customers.\nWith a long-term vision of providing mid- to senior-level management with the ability to use Angles for Oracle, the IT team and Finance business users developed a pilot group that represented several key departments within the 600-person organization that were responsible for creating reports or required data to manage their budget areas throughout the District. This group included a range of people from those who were extremely technically savvy to those who had no technical experience. After the Angles for Oracle training session, the group was given a month to use Angles for Oracle to practice accessing and utilizing the information they needed with this tool.\nThe pilot went very well, drawing praise from all the users, who confirmed that Angles for Oracle was so easy to use that an official training session was not even necessary. The group successfully used Angles for Oracle to find their data and build reports with drilling capabilities enabling managers to review their budget areas and make timely decisions for planning purposes.\n\u201cAngles for Oracle has been so well received across our organization that interest has spread word of mouth and is now expanding to people that weren\u2019t part of the original pilot project. We\u2019re hearing more and more people saying, \u2018Hey, I want Angles for Oracle,\u2019\u201d said Donice Bell, the pilot\u2019s Project Manager. The IT Department is now expanding to additional District management staff to enable the maintenance and management of their respective budgetary areas.\nResults\nOne of the larger objectives for the Angles for Oracle implementation was to streamline and increase the efficiency of reporting processes across the District. Traditionally, the District\u2019s overall operational budget had been managed through a monthly budget report that came from the Finance Department for each one of the cost or budget centers. Finance would print out these reports and send them off to each appropriate manager. Because the reports generally took at least a few days to arrive, the information was already outdated by the time it was received. Finance had also been handling end-of-year budgeting in this way, and due to the complexity of that process, the annual data that arrived on manager\u2019s desks was typically one to two months out of date as well.\nThe District has eliminated the old system of printing budget reports and the Finance Department has conveyed a savings of roughly eight hours per month by using Angles for Oracle. Reports now arrive electronically, in real time, enabling the District\u2019s managers to make faster, more sound business decisions. And while these savings are modest, the larger benefit is the ability to provide the reports on time or at the click of a button and give more control to staff in managing their budgets. The District\u2019s goal of using technology effectively has been achieved.\nThe IT Department plans to expand its community of users to provide the capability to connect and extract data from multiple Oracle-based enterprise applications. This will be another opportunity for District management to obtain relevant data for planning and reporting purposes that will support its mission of providing high-quality wastewater treatment.\n"

        "content": "\n\nXref is an online reference checking tool that is trusted by businesses all over the world to empower great hiring decisions. It offers a fast, simple, and secure alternative to traditional, manual reference checking methods while delivering greater value and assurance than other tech-based solutions.\nXref Needed Greater Efficiency From Its Data to Survive and Scale\nIn 2016, James Solomons joined Xref as CFO, taking on the role while still working as Head of Accounting for Xero, a cloud-based accounting software platform for small- and medium-sized businesses. At the time, Xref was a lean, fast-growing tech start-up, working hard to re-educate the HR market on the benefits of digital referencing. One of the biggest hurdles for Xref was consolidating its data to stay ahead of the market and deliver maximum benefit to the business.\nHowever, financial data was siloed across multiple systems. Work needed to be done to put information in the hands of the management team to respond to changing market conditions and seize opportunities as they arose. When COVID-19 hit in late 2019, companies around the world put a freeze on hiring. Solomons and his team were faced with the challenge of an uncertain future where being able to utilise data to predict market conditions was key to Xref\u2019s continued success.\n\u201cI sat down with the CEO & Board and advised them about the significant impact the pandemic was having on our sales. For two and a half weeks I didn\u2019t do anything else but use Calumo to forecast and re-forecast to find that sweet spot of cash flow break-even,\u201d said Solomons.\nThankfully, after engaging Calumo in late 2018, Xref was well prepared and was able to tighten the purse strings in all the right places to enable them to weather the initial impact of the pandemic.\nXref Was Confident Calumo Was the Right Solution\nIn late 2018, Xref was shopping for the right reporting tool for its needs. The solution needed to:\n\nConnect five Xero instances across the world.\nEnable multi-currency consolidation.\nEnable employee level planning\nMake responding to ad-hoc reporting requests quick and easy.\nDeliver rapid return on investment (ROI).\nBe easy to use, with limited Microsoft Excel knowledge.\nBe capable of including non-financial information for use in reporting and analysis\n\nSolomons and his team chose Calumo\u2019s low-risk proof of concept program to test the capabilities of the system. Working closely with Calumo consultants, Tim Bryden and Sue Hourigan, they quickly saw the value it could provide to Xref.\n\u201cIt showed us exactly what we needed to see, which made the decision easy. A huge attraction was the pricing, which is very competitive compared to many other reporting tools in the market,\u201d said Solomons.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a collaboration between Calumo and you and your team that makes it work, and that\u2019s pretty perfect from our perspective. They came in wanting to understand our business needs and provide solutions they knew would provide a long-term fix.\u201d\nData Oversight Had Far-reaching Benefits for Xref\nThe Xref Finance Team Immediately Saved Time and Boosted Analysis\nData that had previously been difficult to access is now at their fingertips. The team can slice and dice real-time data by any metric they choose through an intuitive platform. Better yet, as Calumo connects directly to Xero, the team feels confident the numbers are correct. They can spend time on providing valuable business insights, not manual data entry and fact-checking.\n\u201cOne of my favourite things about the Calumo platform is the ease of use. You always worry about custom builds, but in this instance, it was just building in our own processes and reports so that flexibility was amazing. Calumo was able to take what we are already doing, speed it up and automate it,\u201d said Solomons.\nThe Team Feels Empowered to Conduct Their Own Analysis\nXref did not use Microsoft heavily before integrating Calumo and used Excel in a limited capacity. Despite this, Calumo was so easy to use that Solomons\u2019 team was able to pick it up right away and spend time on analysis, not data entry.\n\u201cRight now, I have two very capable finance managers running an audit and running a set of books for a public company and it\u2019s all due to the set of tools that we\u2019ve put in place. Without Calumo, my staff would feel less empowered to go on a journey themselves, to become better accountants and better finance people, because they would spend so much time just collecting the information,\u201d said Solomons.\nIntegration With New and Existing Xref Systems Was Quick and Easy\nCalumo was able to connect seamlessly with Xref\u2019s five Xero instances across the world. Real-time data access provided Solomons and his team with immediate updates and crucial extra time to choose a path of action for the business.\nIn July 2019, Xref acquired RapidID, a disruptive ID verification and fraud prevention platform. Normally syncing data from the two entities would be a laborious process, but with Calumo it took minutes.\n\u201cIt was literally a 10-minute process. Suddenly we could see data from RapidID. It just flowed in and away we went,\u201d said Solomons.\nReports for the Board and Investors Takes a Fraction of the Time and Effort to Generate\nAs CFO of a listed company, reporting to various stakeholders used to occupy large amounts of Solomons\u2019 time. With Calumo, his team can simply refresh last month\u2019s reports with new numbers by selecting the next month, dive deeper into any inconsistencies to embed commentary then easily publish the report in a format that works for his executive team and board of directors. Without manual data entry and the accuracy concerns that accompany it, his team can focus on providing business insights to help guide Xref in the right direction.\n\u201cOnce the information is in it takes us about an hour and a half to build our monthly board pack. This is a complex 24-page document, including commentary around all numbers. It\u2019s not scary because I just know it\u2019s correct,\u201d said Solomons.\n\u201cWe were the fastest listed company in Australia to submit the June and September 2021 quarterly cash flow reports [Appendix 4C] to the Australian Securities Exchange. We can generate a quarterly Appendix 4C and lodge it to the market within five days of the end of the quarter with complete confidence.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Hit Hard, but Xref Was Able to Stay Lean, Efficient and Cash Flow Neutral\nGiven that its solution is for the job market, Xref was impacted heavily when the pandemic hit early 2020. With data oversight through Calumo, Xref was able to project forwards and see where efficiencies needed to be made. Despite the challenges of the pandemic the company managed to grow by 56% during the 2021 financial year and post a maiden profit.\nSolomons took full advantage of Calumo\u2019s advanced and intuitive forecasting capabilities to provide focused financial insight to keep the board and senior leadership informed on market conditions; this helped him guide his ship through the storm.\n\u201cIn our monthly board meetings, I ensured that the Directors were aware of our current and forecasted position. I would provide the Calumo reports to support the commentary I was making around our cash flow position. Since the reports are interactive and linked to real-time data, they would allow board members to do their own research using up to date information and be able to ask questions as needed,\u201d said Solomons.\nXref Continue to Expand Its Use of Calumo\nNow Xref considers itself at the end of the beginning of its journey with Calumo and is moving into an innovation phase. It has recently connected Calumo to its internal AWS data warehouse to pull in key operational metrics for inclusion in reporting and also to model different pricing approaches. It plans to build on the existing base of knowledge and processes to refine its use of the platform and better control the data at its disposal.\n"

        "title": "Leveraging Enterprise Software to Address Transfer Pricing Challenges Case Study - Reporting & Analytics - insightsoftware",
        "company": "Celanese",
        "content": "\n\nThe reasons to invest in enterprise-wide operational transfer pricing software are many and varied, although they usually relate to a need to tackle familiar challenges, such as the need to perform cost or shared service allocations more efficiently. Some companies require significant data cleansing to prepare for change or are focused on improving reporting capabilities and controls.\nLearn about Longview Transfer Pricing from insightsoftware\nIn the case of Celanese, a global chemical and specialty material company headquartered in Irving, Texas, it had been managing transfer pricing maintenance and testing on Excel. As a goods-intensive manufacturing company, it has tens of thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs) that it needs to maintain with accurate transfer prices. This meant it needed to spend significant amounts of time pulling and checking data then updating Excel models, leaving little time for analysis.\nNicole Williams is the director of Global Transfer Pricing at Celanese. She explains: \u201cLike most companies, we ran a fairly lean tax department and used manual processes that took a lot of people many hours. As a company, we were looking to the future and planning to grow, so we wanted to get an efficient transfer pricing process in place so that any changes could be accommodated easily.\u201d\nCelanese was already highly focused on automation and digitization. As part of this overall program, the tax team was asked to highlight current pain points, as well as the problems it wanted to address with technology. \u201cI was in a fortunate situation that I did not have to go to leadership with a business case, it was more that it was brought to me,\u201d recalls Williams.\nFind out which questions you should ask providers of transfer pricing software\nKicking Off a Two-Phase Project \nHaving secured a budget to implement Longview Transfer Pricing from insightsoftware, Celanese embarked on two main phases within the project. They designed this approach get the software up and running as quickly as possible, bearing in mind the limited resources available within the tax team and the competing priorities for their time.\nThe first challenge was to work through a significant data cleansing exercise. This was made easier by the fact that the company already used Longview Tax, so there was some metadata that it could reuse to help speed up the process. It completed this in Q3 2020, and the company moved into the second phase, which it completed in Q1 2021.\nOne of the company\u2019s overarching goals in operational transfer pricing was not just to automate inefficient Excel processes, but to make them better and enhance the value they delivered. The benefit of going through phase one was that the company became familiar with the capabilities of the project team at insightsoftware, who also had a chance to learn about Celanese\u2019s processes.\nThese synergies and efficiencies helped the company move smoothly into phase two. Celanese uses SAP as its global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and maintains transfer prices for tangible goods at a material level as well as at plant level. The company updated prices on a monthly or quarterly basis, and the aim was to move towards a more automated process to free up the team from having to make manual changes.\nAnother early benefit of implementing Longview Transfer Pricing was that a geographically dispersed team working on the process could all use the same enterprise application. Previously, different groups were using different models, and variable processes to pull data. Today everyone uses the same consistent tool and processes, which streamlines the transfer pricing process significantly.\nLessons Learned \nThe biggest lesson learned from the project relates to data and understanding exactly what the company was trying to achieve when implementing Longview Transfer Pricing. The objective to create better processes required the tax team to have access to more granular data. This involved them working with several teams to understand whether the level of detail was available, then validating data along the way.\nBecause the company was working within a tight timeline, it was managing multiple processes at the same time, including designing the solution, training users, and validating data. It used the automated data cleansing and aggregation tool Alteryx to test and validate workflows, which was key to the success of the project.\nAnother success factor was to have robust training and documentation in place, so that the company could roll out the new transfer pricing system effectively. This was particularly important because the output from operational transfer pricing is part of the data provided to the company\u2019s financial statement auditors. Having the documentation that shows where data has come from in the company\u2019s systems is essential.\nThe last lesson learned is that once in place, transfer pricing software provides additional capabilities such as scenario planning and forecasting. The tax team can now be confident that they can answer questions at any time about potential transfer pricing and provisioning adjustments, for example.\nOutcomes and Benefits \nThe overall benefits delivered by the system include risk mitigation, achieved by replacing Excel. Any human errors caused by mis-entering data or including the wrong formulas are eradicated. The second benefit is that all the relevant knowledge held inside the tax teams\u2019 heads are now included in a consistent transfer pricing process. \u201cWe wanted to take away as much subjectivity from the process as possible,\u201d says Williams.\u00a0\nThe third benefit is the freeing up people hours, because the tax team no longer has to spend time investigating exceptions or manually entering data.\u00a0\u00a0\nHaving established the basic transfer pricing process successfully, Celanese will add other costs into its model such as those for shared service centers. It also plans to deliver additional training on the system to new and existing employees, and to explore more of the capabilities of the software as the company grows and transforms in the future.\u00a0\nBeing able to incorporate changes, such as acquisitions, into the operational transfer pricing tool will be hugely valuable to the company in the years ahead. It will be easy to add additional entities or set up new transfer pricing policies without having to worry about how the tax team will cope. Instead of being behind the curve, the tax team will be able to address such challenges head on, says Williams.\u00a0\nRead our five tips for boosting operational transfer pricing effectiveness\nFinally, Williams observes that the biggest hurdle she faced when introducing enterprise software for transfer pricing was \u201cembracing the art of the possible.\u201d She explains, \u201cI\u2019m a traditional tax person and I\u2019ve been doing transfer pricing for about 10 years. I knew there was a better way to manage it than with Excel, but not really what the end result would look like. Partnering with insightsoftware was what really got us there. And once I got past that hurdle and understood what was possible, I felt this huge burden lifted off my shoulders.\u201d\nUsing Longview Transfer Pricing offered Celanese the following improvements to their transfer pricing process:\n\nAutomated efficient Excel processes that enhance the value they deliver.\nTheir geographically dispersed team can all use the same enterprise application.\nBetter processes allow their tax team access to more granular data.\nRobust training and documentation in place meant they could hit the ground running.\n\n"

        "content": "\nTruckee Donner leveraged Logi to a complete cyclical workflow that includes the ability to document, review, manage, and report such critical information as every general order condition and rectification in the life of a facility.\nThe Truckee-Donner Public Utility District offers electric and water services in the Truckee, California area. The organization is a non-profit, publicly owned utility governed by officials elected by the registered voters of the District.\nThe Challenge\nTruckee-Donner needed to comply with California regulations requiring utilities to be able to produce detailed, accurate information on every aspect of maintenance in a very short time period. The utility must record the \u2018who, what, when, where, why, and how\u2019 of everything they do, and be prepared to answer questions about specific records at any time. There are serious consequences for failure to do so. In line with Truckee-Donner\u2019s mission, they needed to identify an effective solution at the lowest possible cost.\nTruckee-Donner needed a BI solution that would allow them to mine data from a variety of data sources, handle huge amounts of data, and produce intuitive reports for a wide range of users; from field technicians to knowledge workers. Truckee-Donner required a solution that could be developed and deployed quickly and easily without requiring training for non-technical end users.\nThe Solution\nIan Fitzgerald, Geographic Information System Coordinator, Truckee-Donner PUD, selected Logi Symphony due to ease of use and agility as well as the intuitive, web-based user interface.\n\u201cWe also looked at the Crystal Reports server-based reporting system which was almost too rigid. While it was great for reports, there were no dashboards, which are a crucial component. The time required to develop, run, and test our system is significant, so we looked for solutions that wouldn\u2019t require extensive development efforts.\n\u201cWe own part of the Oracle Fusion application and looked at Oracle for BI, but we found it didn\u2019t meet a lot of our requirements, such as connecting to multiple data sources without the need to code. It was also extremely expensive.\n\u201cWe looked for something reasonably priced with a development style that was based on drag-and-drop and configuration, and not code-intensive. It was important for us to be able to go in and build custom BI apps without learning new code or writing any code,\u201d stated Mr. Fitzgerald.\nThe Results\nThe resulting system Truckee-Donner implemented encompasses a complete cyclical workflow that includes the ability to document, review, manage, and report such critical information as every general order condition and rectification in the life of a facility. Management and configuration of the system is straightforward and simple.\n Interoperability \nMr. Fitzgerald continues, \u201cAt Truckee-Donner, we like to apply the notion of harnessing multiple technologies to simplify our work. The Logi Symphony architecture allowed for seamless embeddability and integration into other applications. This enabled us to build a single, unified system, integrating each technology\u2019s unique capabilities.\n\u201cFor example, to manage recording the many details of inspections, we merged GIS, GPS, and SOA technologies, automating the record creation process.\u201d In past setups, inspection data often had to be filtered through database tables, cryptic and unreadable to the untrained user. Truckee-Donner needed a software interface that made deciphering the data quick, easy, and sensible. With Logi Symphony, Truckee-Donner was able to use a familiar technology like a Web browser to provide an interface to the user that was instantly recognizable and unintimidating. Running BI, BPM, and GIS engines behind the browser, the mined data is now well organized and easily decipherable, whether in a graph, table, map, or report. Diving deeper into the data is as simple as mouse clicking on a graph or table entry.\nWith Logi Symphony\u2019 browser-based BI approach, a user can traverse data from multiple systems with a few mouse clicks. Starting with an inspection ticket status, they can bring up the number of tickets assigned to each user, then view tickets assigned to individual users, access the history of that ticket, map the location and, finally, assign an outstanding ticket to a utility crew as a work order.\nTruckee-Donner also simplified crews\u2019 abilities to identify tickets assigned to them, understand ticket priority level, show the tickets\u2019 geographic location, and make vehicle-routing abilities available to minimize travel time.\n Agility, Quick Integration, Easy Deployment \nMr. Fitzgerald states, \u201cI connected to four different data sources instantaneously: Oracle, MySQL, Access, and Excel flat files. It is great to be able to have a single graph that shows data visualizations from multiple data sources, and the end user sees an attractive, seamless experience. Our solution handles a large amount of information and also has a mobile component.\u201d\nDue to Logi Symphony\u2019 code-free development environment, Mr. Fitzgerald was able to develop and deploy everything in only four weeks as the only person working on the Logi Symphony software.\n\u201cCustom reports used to require one to two hours each and they now require mere minutes. We receive many requests per year. Logi Symphony has easily saved our developers a month of work,\u201d stated Mr. Fitzgerald.\n Rapid Response to Changes \n\u201cBecause Logi Symphony is configurable, without the need for software coding, altering the program by adding a process stage, removing a retired employee, or modifying the information recorded on a work order form takes under an hour to develop and deploy. The program has also easily transcended a general order inspection program to other business cases within the utility, such as vegetation management, meter replacement, leak identification and repair, and outage damage assessments,\u201d stated\nMr. Fitzgerald.\nFinally, there may be occasions when a utility must provide proof of efforts to maintain a safe electrical system. Truckee-Donner ensured this was possible by combining one-click data review and analysis of all inspections ever collected within this program, using BPM and GIS for the historical record archiving of individual locations with Logi Symphony as a front-end reporting tool. The utility can quickly and easily generate a variety of canned and ad-hoc reports.\n"

SSB works across industries, such as sports and entertainment, healthcare, energy and more. SSB was established under the concept that consultants should be experts in what they do. The firm is comprised of data experts, developers and management consultants with various backgrounds \u2013 everything from Certified Public Accountants to engineers and Project Management Professionals.\nThe company also develops software; offering enterprise reporting and analytics solutions to help break down the silos of systems that don\u2019t integrate with one another.\nSSB\u2019s Central Intelligence platform is aimed at helping organizations better understand big data issues. The solution allows for secure, fast integration of enterprise data, such as CRM, Finance, Operations, email marketing, and social media systems \u2013 all from one central, cloud-based solution.\nThe Challenge\nSSB\u2019s Ticketing Intelligence software was SSB\u2019s first software solution that provides ticket sellers with real-time dashboards to analyze and report on sales.\nTicketing Intelligence reports leveraged Microsoft\u2019s SQL Server Reporting Services, and SSB realized that in order to be more competitive in the space, it needed to provide dynamic and customizable dashboards for its customers.\nWhen SSB began to develop its new cloud-based solution, Central Intelligence, the company began its search for an embeddable analytics solution that could create customized reports and dashboards, with personalization that also supported the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) approach of many of SSB\u2019s clients.\nThe Solution\nAs part of the business intelligence (BI) industry, SSB has come across nearly every BI and data analytics solution on the market. SSB found that Logi Symphony was the right choice as it could be fully integrated into the Central Intelligence solution, and the tokenization capabilities would simplify how SSB developed standardized solutions across many customers.\nAndrew Brodie, CEO at SSB, noted that he had never seen any solution with such an extensive Meta data capability allowing SSB to deliver high impact reports and dashboards in an accelerated manner. He also appreciated that he could offer his customers customized reports while only managing a single code base.\nThe Results\nEase of Use Leads to Faster Time to Market\nSSB has found Logi Symphony to be one of the easiest-to-use solutions, and the team is able to train new employees within a week\u2019s time.\n\u201cWe were impressed with how quickly we were able to embed and white label with Logi Symphony. We feel that it has really accelerated our time to market and is making our product better,\u201d Brodie stated.\nSSB is now able to create reports much faster than they have in the past. Brodie notes that, based on his experience, Logi Symphony is at least twice as fast as Microsoft Reporting Services and three times faster than Oracle.\nOnce a standard report is created, SSB is able to use the same code to roll out branded, data-specific reports for each customer, whether it\u2019s a university or professional sports team, or even a performing arts center.\nMobile Dashboards Increase Customer Revenue\nThe ability to view the reports on the go has also helped increase customers\u2019 revenue. For example, a football coach at a large state university happened to glance at a mobile report while watching his son\u2019s soccer game. He learned the football ticket sales were ahead of schedule. Based on this insight, he increased the price of tickets by $10 and ended up making $100,000 more that day than he would have.\nLowering Operating Costs\nLogi Symphony is also feeding into SSB\u2019s consulting services. SSB has become an extension of many of its customers\u2019 IT departments, and has brought BI operating costs down. In fact, a large sports association has reduced costs by 500 percent through the use of SSB.\n"

        "content": "\nUse Case\n\nYoumanage wanted to drastically enhance the reporting functionality in their application\nThe development team was spending countless hours on the analytics code base, leaving less time for improving the core application\nWith Logi Symphony, the development team can respond to ad-hoc reporting requests quickly and customer experience has improved\n\n\u00a0\nFrustrating Homegrown Analytics\nYoumanage was frustrated with the amount of maintenance and development resources required by the homegrown analytics in its application. \u201cFrom a dev point of view, we were struggling to make it work,\u201d recalls Maurice Davidson, Senior Developer at Youmanage. \u201cEvery time we had to build out a custom report for a client, or when something went wrong, it would take forever to fix because we had to go back in and relearn the code base before we could make any changes. It was a lot of time spent relearning the system or playing around with it trying to make it work instead of adding value.\u201d\nAt the time, updating and maintaining the code to their homegrown analytics took a significant amount of time. The development team was stretched between maintaining and updating the analytics code base and the core application. As a result, Youmanage only offered customers a limited number of preset reports, and no way to aggregate data or create visualizations. Customers were left with reporting that wasn\u2019t as powerful or useful as they needed it to be.\nBuild vs Buy\n\u201cAt one point there was so much going wrong with the reporting functionality that we came together as a dev and product team and all agreed that this wasn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d said Davidson. The team was increasingly frustrated because whenever they fixed a problem or added a new feature in one area, it would break functionality in another area. As a result, development cycles stretched on and on. \u201cThe analytics module was diluting the team and the potential of the application. It was taking away time we could have been spending to add value to our core product,\u201d said Davidson.\nYoumanage decided to explore third-party solutions to speed up development cycles, expand their analytics capabilities, and improve customer experience. Davidson commented, \u201cYou could build analytics yourself, and have a product at the end of it. But, to keep pace with all the features that the market demands, you are always going to be on your back foot. That\u2019s why we made the strategic decision to integrate a third-party solution.\u201d\nReducing Development Time by 75% with Logi Symphony\nWhen searching for an analytics solution, top-of-mind for Youmanage was the idea that customers should have self-service so they could create their own custom reports without heavy involvement from the dev team. The team also needed a compliant solution that would securely handle customer data. In particular, Youmanage needed column-level security\u2014the ability to hide specific columns of data from unauthorized users.\n\u201cWe had specific and critical security requirements,\u201d said Davidson. \u201cWe needed to deliver security at the cell level, and Logi Symphony ticked the box on that. Additionally, the Logi solution was feature-rich and highly configurable, but also intuitive to ensure a great customer experience.\u201d\nFinally, theming\u2014the ability to create a perfectly embedded white-labeled dashboard\u2014was an essential requirement for the team. \u201cOne of my favorite things about our new solution with Logi\u00a0 is that you can\u2019t tell where our application stops and Logi begins,\u201d said Davidson. The ability to customize with Logi Symphony helped ensure Youmanage could deliver a seamless user experience for their customers and didn\u2019t have to sacrifice on brand.\nYoumanage also saved on development time. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t pay me to go back to before Logi Symphony. The difference is night and day. For example, we\u2019ve realized a 75 percent decrease in development time with Logi, so customers receive their new analytics features faster than ever. It takes a lot of burden off my team.\u201d\nCraig Hynd, Marketing Executive at Youmanage, said, \u201cWe were blown away by how well it has been received. It has been a big differentiator for the new business team. Not only have we have seen win rates increase, but also deal size has increased 50 percent. From a marketing perspective, it makes my job easy because Logi Symphony makes the dashboards look so much slicker, and they have so much more depth than before.\u201d Davidson adds, \u201cOur customers are delighted with the new reporting functionality. Those who want to dig deep into the data have the ability, and those who want to pull a few reports quickly can easily go into the product and do that too.\u201d\nThe Conclusion\n\n\nInstead of spending extra hours maintaining the analytic code base in Youmanage\u2019s homegrown reporting solution, Youmanage decided to free up their team by investing in an analytics development platform. In switching to Logi Symphony, they were able to quickly create a full-featured analytics solution that significantly reduced development time by 75 percent, expanded deal size, and improved customer satisfaction.\n\n\n"

The company\u2019s Digital Business Platform application focused on helping large enterprise teams orchestrate and automate complex business processes such as management of global mobile asset, or on-boarding and expenses.\nAt the time, about half of the service requests that came in from users were for custom reports. \u201cA lot of our professional service time was being billed for custom reports instead of building out and offering expertise in business process management, which is our core product,\u201d Gibbons recalls. \u201cWe are very customer focused, and the large volume of service requests made it clear that we weren\u2019t empowering our customers to get what they needed or fully leveraging our talented team.\u201d After doing a lot of research, Gibbons noticed that once his team started working with one department, they were able to increase their scope across multiple departments very quickly\u2014and all wanted their own custom views of the data.\nCompeting applications only offered end users a standard view with out-of-date information. If a customer wanted a custom report, they would have to pay an additional cost and wait about two weeks to get information. \u201cIt dawned on me that we needed to create something that gave customers data in real time and served their various reporting needs. It was very different than what we offered, and it was risky, but I saw an opportunity to better serve our customers,\u201d Gibbons said. He realized that if Symbox was going to completely redefine its focus, they would need to execute quickly and go to market in just eight short months.\nSymbox's Build vs Buy Philosophy\nOnce Symbox decided to integrate analytics into their core value proposition, they faced another tough question: to build or to buy? \u201cI abide by a core strategy,\u201d said Gibbons, \u201cStick to what you are good at, stick to your core, and focus your development efforts on that.\u201d With analytics as a main part of their value offering, the Symbox team calculated the cost of building a solution themselves. How long would it take? How much capital would they need? What would maintenance look like? What sacrifices would they have to make to their core IP?\n\u201cAfter we evaluated everything in detail, we realized analytics wasn\u2019t our core IP. And it makes sense\u2014we aren\u2019t an analytics company,\u201d said Gibbons. \u201cWhen we thought about the core skills on the team, we knew we could create a nice-looking front end, but we would have to devote a lot of resources and make new hires to deliver a solid back end.\u201d In addition to the obvious skills gap, the Symbox team also knew it would take much longer to build out the analytics themselves\u2014making it impossible to go to market quickly.\n\u201cThe nail in the coffin was when we started looking at what it would take to maintain a homegrown solution,\u201d said Gibbons. It wasn\u2019t just the technical support, but the ongoing investment needed to update and enhance the analytics down the road. Considering the required skills, time, and resources, Symbox ultimately decided to buy a solution. \u201cIt\u2019s always tempting to build something like this yourself, especially when you are a growing company with very smart and talented developers,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cBut when we really thought it out, analytics wasn\u2019t our expertise\u2014and therefore wasn\u2019t something we should build.\u201d\nIn choosing an analytics solution, Symbox wanted a vendor who shared their high standards of product quality. They talked to half a dozen companies before choosing to partner with Logi Symphony. Logi provided just what they needed: a flexible platform with a focus on quality and customer success.\nBeating the \u201cBig\u201d Players and Expanding New Business\nThe greatest value for any product manager is to deliver something that users love and can\u2019t live without. With analytics, Symbox delivered a product that immediately identified weaknesses and holes in business processes, translating to real business value for their customers.\nThe cherry on top? None of Symbox\u2019s competitors\u2014even the biggest companies\u2014could offer the same capability. The team immediately saw an uptick in user engagement. \u201cWe had a very large market-leading client who found it was taking years to fully onboard new enterprise clients. It became both an operational and customer experience priority for them,\u201d Gibbons recounts. Using the analytics embedded in the Symbox application, the client was able to identify the problems plaguing the onboarding process and implement a solution, resulting in a 97 percent improvement. Now, it now takes them an average of just 24 days to onboard a client.\nIn the past, the Symbox team would spend a significant amount of time building reports and retrieving data for this type of project. \u201cNow with Logi, we have access to any information we want at our fingertips, and our customers can build their own reports with the self-service capability,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cCustomers love that the data is in real time and they can easily get to their information.\u201d\nWhile Symbox always maintained strong customer relationships, they are now able to better compete against some of their biggest competitors. \u201cAfter embedding analytics, we have a strong competitive advantage,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cWe\u2019ve closed a number of new deals in the past six months, and we\u2019ve seen an exponential increase in new business from years past,\u201d Gibbons said. In securing those new deals, Symbox beat out market leaders, including two of its biggest competitors.\nThe new strategy helped Symbox reposition themselves in the marketplace. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a customer-centric approach, with a strong focus on delivering quality. Now, we also have a strong competitive advantage and deliver an even more valuable product. Logi helped us achieve that with analytics,\u201d Gibbons concluded.\nThe Conclusion\nAfter realizing the long-term investment required to maintain a homegrown analytics solution, Symbox decided to buy an embedded analytics solution. With the help of Logi Symphony, they have saved 50% in operation costs compared to building analytics in house, and their average order value has increased by 25%.\n"

        "content": "\n\nCitycounty Insurance Services (CIS) is a governmental organization that provides property, general and auto liability, workers\u2019 compensation, and employee benefits coverage and risk management services tailored to the unique needs of their Oregon city and county members.\nThe Challenge\nInsurance claims, risk management and underwriting activities generate a lot of data, all of which needs to be analyzed and reported on regularly. CIS was finding their previous data-reporting tool cumbersome and knew it was time to replace it with a flexible, adaptable system \u2013 something that was intuitive and easy to use, and didn\u2019t require users to have special training to do what they wanted. This tool needed to suit a range of users, regardless of technical expertise and knowledge.\nWhat\u2019s more, CIS needed capabilities above and beyond what basic solutions like Crystal Reports and Excel could offer \u2013 for example, automation of monthly and quarterly reports.\nCIS Risk Information Manager Trent McGath stated, \u201cWe wanted a flexible, adaptable system we could use to both push pre-configured reports out to the website, as well as give our customers the ability to dig into the data in a way they couldn\u2019t before. We needed to take our reporting capabilities into the 21st century.\u201d\nThe Solution\nCIS chose Logi Symphony because it was both cost-effective and satisfied their requirement for a solution anyone in their organization could use. They implemented internal and external applications of the solution and began using it successfully from day one with only minimal training.\nToday, the organization\u2019s local government members, who do not necessarily have expertise in data analytics, can easily access Info to retrieve and interact with monthly claims reports. Logi Symphony assists CIS staff in building their own dashboards and reports directly within the organization\u2019s underwriting and claims systems. What\u2019s more, CIS trustees utilize Info-developed reports to view high-level dashboards regarding benefits programs. CIS is also using Logi Symphony to develop a benefits data warehouse as a cost-effective alternative to purchased vendor warehousing.\nCIS analysts are also able complete ad hoc analysis and interact with the data extensively.\nMcGath described the experience of using Info as seamless, noting users don\u2019t see a difference between the organization\u2019s features and Logi Symphony\u2019s tools \u2013 \u201cIt really looks like our own claims application, which has helped with adoption. They don\u2019t realize they are using an analytics application, it\u2019s just part of their workflow.\u201d\n\u201cBeing able to change the CSS and the look and feel was something we didn\u2019t really investigate when choosing a vendor, but have absolutely come to believe is essential,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd Logi Symphony does it quite well.\u201d\nThe Results\nLike many Logi Symphony customers, CIS experienced firsthand the value Logi Symphony can provide to any user, whether technical or non-technical and internal or external. Logi Symphony has successfully fulfilled their need for a solution that appeals to a wide range of people with different needs and skill levels.\nThese include CIS members who have little technical knowledge but want to view claims reports and minimally interact with data; claims adjusters who have technical expertise and want to create their own reports from the data; and power users who want to do their own ad hoc reporting and ask new questions of the data. Logi Symphony successfully serves all of these users for CIS.\nTime savings\nInfo\u2019s ad hoc and automated reporting capabilities have been a real time saver for CIS. Rather than doing one-off reports, the organization now builds capabilities for repeat report requests directly into Info and makes these reports freely available to users.\n\u201cNow we can just run a report in Logi Symphony and we don\u2019t have to monitor or manage it,\u201d McGath stated. \u201cThis allows our team more opportunities to actually focus on a primary business objective of analyzing claims data.\u201d\nEase of access\nAccording to McGath, this is the first time many CIS staff and members have had direct access to claims information, and \u201cthey love being able to slice and dice analysis grids.\u201d\n\u201cIn the world we live in, people want access to information and they want it easily. The more they can get their hands dirty and really dig deep, they love it.\u201d\nBased on the success of their experience with Info, CIS is expanding its use of Logi Symphony products to the Self-Service Reporting Module (SSRM). They want to build out dashboards, benchmarking, and high-level graphics for specific areas of their business (i.e., employment claims).\nMcGath concluded, \u201cLogi Symphony is going to be our one-stop shop for everything.\u201d\n"

        "company": "Nordr",
        "content": "\n\nLarge-scale real estate developer Nordr focuses on residential, commercial and mixed-use developments in metropolitan areas throughout Norway and Sweden. With headquarters in Oslo, Norway, the company has 18,800 individual housing units to its credit and has grown into one of the largest and most active developers on the Scandinavian peninsula.\nThe Challenge\nNordr has built a reputation upon sustainable development projects in communities that place a high value on green construction. They are amongst the first developers in the region to be recognized with Nordic Ecolabeling and have successfully developed the largest building research establishment\u2019s environmental assessment method (BREEAM)-certified housing project. Given this commitment to green construction, developing 18,800 total units in 147 different housing projects is no easy feat.\nThe size, scope, and complexity of managing simultaneous development projects in two countries is demanding. Doing this while navigating the environmental and regulatory hurdles became a massively labor-intensive task for the 180-person staff. Kristoffer Danielsen, business controller at Nordr, recalls that his team was stuck in an endless cycle of manually assembling spreadsheets for their planning process\u2013copying/pasting data from various sources and dumping it into one large, convoluted model.\nReal estate planning requires juggling numerous variables and \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios, as Danielsen explained,\n\u201cThe challenge of the real estate industry is that there are so many variables. There are so many ways of calculating the value of the land and the value of the project that we are selling. We need to drill down to each specific area, to determine how much a unit can be sold for, depending on many internal and external variables. We need to figure out a precise calculation if we are first going to buy the land to sell it. Or buy to develop it ourselves to make a profitable project.\u201d\nTheir old, manual planning process was time consuming and resulted in costly delays. In short, they were in desperate need of a new planning system that was fit to address the growing scale and complexity of their operation.\nBuilding to Success With Bizview\nNordr made the decision to adopt Bizview as a planning solution in 2017. This gave them the ability to manage the variables that were once stalling project planning efforts. \u201cWith Bizview, we have all the information in one place. With one click, we can gather up all the planning and budgeting information from all our projects, into one report in an instant,\u201d says Danielsen.\nThis ability to streamline the planning processes spread to other areas of the operation. As Danielsen described, Nordr\u2019s business model operates with two distinct arms\u2013one side of the company scouts out land and brings development projects forward when land has been purchased. The second side of the business buys and sells land only. Bizview enabled the company to consolidate both areas of the operation into one planning solution. Danielsen goes on to explain, \u201cThe key benefit for choosing Bizview is that we can access all the information in one go. We have all the resources, everything we need in one place. So, whenever we need a report for the whole company, we have it in an instant.\u201d\nWithin the company, Bizview\u2019s reach extended beyond finance and its financial planning and analysis (FP&A) duties over to marketing, where according to Danielsen. \u201cOur marketing department now has access to updated budget data to support their forecasting process. Now they have a view of the past\u2013how much we have sold\u2013and how much we predict we are going to sell in the future. The marketing department used to manually perform this function quarterly, now they are able to reforecast weekly.\u201d\nNavigating Success\n\u201cBizview is the key coordinator when it comes to planning our whole business\u2026 It is our source of information for the project organization.\u201d\nNordr has greatly improved their planning process as a result of implementing Bizview:\n\nConsolidated\u00a0data\u00a0collection.\u00a0\u201cWe are doing all of our calculations, for all of our projects, in one place.\u201d\u00a0\nIncreased\u00a0planning\u00a0accuracy.\u00a0\u201cWe can make precise calculations in huge detail.\u201d\u00a0\nReduced\u00a0reporting\u00a0time.\u00a0\u201cWhenever we need a report for the whole company, we have it in an instant.\u201d\u00a0\nAccelerated\u00a0reforecasting\u00a0schedule\u00a0(from quarterly to weekly).\u00a0\n\nFor Nordr, the value of Bizview has been immense. By allowing the organization to manage the complexity in their business through the planning process, and to scale as new projects are initiated, Bizview has helped unlock new growth opportunities and profitability.\n"

First report generated within 10 minutes, fully integrated into business processes within two weeks.\nMultiple users able to engage with data from anywhere in real-time.\n75% time saving on report creation.\nTrusted single source of truth to boost collaboration and data culture.\nConfidence in\u00a0stock levels\u00a0builds customer trust and satisfaction.\n\nBased in the Netherlands, Hermadix has been the leading supplier of shading agents and coatings to the horticultural industry and diy-coatings for more than 60 years. Its products help customers to achieve the very best greenhouse climate possible with innovative, high-quality products and its tailor-made advice. Consumers have come to know Hermadix as the name behind a range of high-quality paints and stains.\nIt Was Time for Hermadix to Embrace Its Data\nBefore 2015, Hermadix struggled with its dated business basic software used for 40 years. Making the tough, but right, decision to turn away from the sunk cost fallacy, Hermadix acknowledged its need to shift the business toward a data-driven future. Michel van Zijverden, Financial Director at Hermadix, said an update was needed to make the business more efficient and professional.\n\u201cWe needed to standardize our standard system to alleviate my responsibility for maintaining everything. That was the main reason why we changed to Microsoft Dynamics NAV.\u201d\nBut even with a new ERP, van Zijverden was still tasked with building all new reports as no other staff members had the skills or tools to do so.\n\u201cI had to do it every time. I would use another report or modify and old one. It was a lot of work,\u201d said van Zijverden. \u201cWe started a business in Spain too, so I had to travel a lot. I used to be able to be on hand all the time, but it became clear we needed a solution to enable staff to make their own analysis.\u201d\nJet Reports Allowed Hermadix to Work Smarter and Harder\nWhen it came to finding the right tool, Harmonize IT came to the rescue, demonstrating how easy it was to create reports using Jet Reports. The employees at Hermadix liked needed a tool that:\n\nWas easy to use and would generate quick ROI.\nEnable self-service reporting.\nProvided access to real-time reliable data when they needed it.\nWould link directly to the data source, to remove risk of manual error and increase confidence in reported numbers.\n\n\u201cHarmonize IT came in with a strong understanding of only what we needed as opposed to overloading us with lots of information. This really set us up for success.\u201d\nHermadix had a strong need for a module that would help analyze its paint recipes in greater detail. Thankfully, Harmonize IT specializes in boosting data capabilities of chemical companies within Dynamics NAV. With Harmonize IT onboard, van Zijverden was empowered with industry specific training and knowledge, and quickly grasped the basics of Jet Reports.\n\u201cThe full implementation of Jet Reports took only a few days. But it was also instantly easy to use. Within 10 minutes of install I created my first report.\u201d\nWhen Hermadix took the next step and upgraded from Dynamics NAV to Dynamics 365 Business Central, the portability of Jet Reports smoothed the transition and helped them get up and running again in a matter of a few days.\nJet Reports Shored Up Hermadix\u2019s Tricky Supply Chain\nHermadix now has six users (or roughly half its staff) using Jet Reports. These staff can easily analyse chemical stock in real-time to help inform future purchases and sales. This is essential in a shifting market dealing with supply chain issues, as high-demand raw materials can be very hard to obtain and need to be ordered well in advance. van Zijverden said Hermadix can forecast stock through the next period to understand its raw materials needs.\n\u201cA lot of factories have moved to China. With COVID-19, shipping raw materials the last year was very hard with shortages in almost everything because of international trade restrictions. Anything from pigments to anti-foam additives became much harder to source. Normally delivery time would\u2019ve been two to three weeks and, since the beginning of the pandemic, it is sometimes up to seven months.\u201d\nvan Zijverden said that Jet Reports added predictability to the business in such uncertain times. Through Jet Reports, Hermadix had complete oversight of its business needs. It could identify shortages early and account for extended delivery times, deftly course correcting in the turbulent waters of the pandemic.\nUnderstanding Empowers Reliability for\u202fHermadix\nJet Reports Means Less Time Reporting and More Time Analyzing\nImplementing Jet Reports has meant a 75% time saving on report creation, said van Zijverden. Using Jet Reports easy prebuilt content means that reports can be created at the click of a button. There is no need for customization, or complicated creation, the report is ready in minutes.\nJet Reports streamlined Hermadix\u2019s data processes to further boost oversight, said van Zijverden.\n\u201cBefore, we did not have a stock counting system. We only did it once per year. Now, with Jet Reports and Dynamics 365 BC, we have complete control of our stock. Even from Spain I can do purchases in the Netherlands.\u201d\nReliable Reports Means Faster, More Informed Decision-Making\nBefore Jet Reports, employees at Hermadix did not trust the data. Staff would waste time double-checking to make sure the data was correct because there wasn\u2019t a single reliable source of truth.\nJet Reports has significantly increased staff quality of life at Hermadix. Now, staff spend less time verifying the data, and more time analysing it to better inform business decisions. Jet Reports has boosted confidence and engagement and helped van Zijverden build a stronger data culture at Hermadix.\n\u201cWhen people don\u2019t trust the system, they\u2019re going to ask questions and be cautious. They\u2019ll say things like \u2018Do we really have to buy that stuff?,\u2019\u201d said van Zijverden. \u201cPeople are more willing to use the data as a thorough basis now. There are no \u2018what ifs.\u2019\u201d\nAutomated Ordering Means Greater DIY Customer Satisfaction\nWith Jet Reports, Hermadix\u2019s customer relationships have also improved. The DIY market makes up a large portion of the business, and this area saw dramatic increase during the pandemic with so many people forced to spend time at home. Now, with Jet Reports, Hermadix can better maintain its stock levels, so when DIY customers make purchases online, they instantly get an order confirmation with delivery time.\n\u201cCustomers can be confident in our delivery because we are confident in our raw materials. There is no variance,\u201d said van Zijverden.\nAdditionally, this is an automated process for Hermadix, so staff don\u2019t get bogged down with follow up emails. Customers receive all the information they need upfront, removing any need for customers to chase for confirmation.\n\u201cIf a customer places an order at 11 am, they\u2019ll have a confirmation email by 11:15 am that lets them know the status of their order, the date the order it will be delivered at our premises, and the date it\u2019ll be delivered to them.\u201d\nHermadix Continues to Explore Its Use of Jet Reports\nHermadix intends to continue expanding its capabilities with Jet Reports. van Zijverden said that it\u2019s time he started learning how he can leverage more of Jet Reports\u2019 utility to drive business value.\n\u201cI really want to dig in and see the new possibilities that Jet Reports can offer us. We are happy with what it does for us now, but I know there is much more that can help our business, so the next step is to explore those possibilities.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nHampered by manual reporting processes, in the past Cromology often lacked timely data to effectively inform decision-making. After working with CrossPoint 365 to implement Jet Analytics, the business has seen dramatic improvements.\n\nEasy analysis that extends past native enterprise resource planning (ERP) reporting tools.\n1-2 days saved per week on reporting.\nData oversight enables efficient collaboration between business units.\nIncreased Sales success due to deeper data insights on market trends.\nTraining from CrossPoint empowered staff to conduct their own analysis, reducing load on IT.\nData culture and cleanliness has been greatly improved with data transparency.\n\nLegacy Is a Double-edged Sword for Long Standing Paint Brands \nIn Spain, many paint companies are\u00a0strong,\u00a0multi-generational family businesses\u00a0that\u00a0are clinging to\u00a0dated business practices\u00a0and\u00a0missing opportunities lying dormant in their data.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a mature industry\u00a0in Spain, where many organizations are protective of their data. We\u00a0decided to break from the pack and use\u00a0our data to gain competitive\u00a0advantage,\u201d said Bert Van Soest, BI\u00a0manager at\u00a0Cromology.\nRecent advances in technology, growing regulatory pressure, and rising consumer expectations have drastically increased the complexity of running a modern paint manufacturing business. The manual data processes that worked for the last century are not efficient enough to effectively manage today\u2019s multiple data flows from across the business.\nCromology Holds onto Legacy While Embracing Modern Data Technology \nWith history stretching back over 270 years, Cromology is one of the biggest European players in the decorative painting industry. It has five research laboratories, nine production sites, seven logistics platforms and more than 380 integrated Points of Sale and e-shops spread across the country.\nIn the past, Cromology was facing many of the issues previously outlined, with data siloed within business units.\nCromology made the wise decision to invest in its data and integrated Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Supply Chain Management to help organize data across its business. As many businesses do, Cromology realized that its data analysis ambitions extended past the stock reporting capabilities of Dynamics and Power BI. So, they engaged local Dynamics experts, CrossPoint365, to help them find the right business intelligence solution for their needs.\n\u201cWe were sold an ERP solution that promised reporting capabilities, but it did not have the level of depth we needed. We wanted to autonomously create reports and analysis without relying on support from the provider. That\u2019s when CrossPoint365 reached out and we got a very good feeling about them from day one,\u201d said Van Soest.\nCromology was looking for a solution that would:\n\nIntegrate data from across its business units to enable more holistic analysis.\nAutomate\u00a0its\u00a0regular reporting.\nQuickly provide deeper analysis in an approachable format.\nReduce\u00a0reliance on IT and enable teams\u00a0to generate their own analysis.\nIncrease collaboration and transparency by providing a single source of truth for their data.\n\nWorking with CrossPoint365, Cromology chose Jet Analytics, insightsoftware\u2019s data management and analytics platform, to simplify and accelerate its Power BI deployment and enable it to manage analytics in-house, to help with its push to the forefront of the paint manufacturing industry. Integration was quick and painless and Cromology was seeing return on investment within 60 days.\n\u201cCrossPoint suggested Jet Analytics and after seeing the presentation, we knew it would give us the access and control we needed. CrossPoint\u2019s philosophy of teaching the processes, rather than doing it for us, has been crucial in enabling the long-term success of our team. Whenever we need support, CrossPoint responds immediately, allowing us to fix our problems in the moment, without needing to wait,\u201d said Van Soest.\nJet Analytics Positively Impacted Every Business Unit \nBusiness Intelligence Saves One to Two Days Per Week on Reporting\nThe efficiency gains for the BI team were immediate. Regular reports that had taken days to extract from the ERP, now were updated in a matter of minutes. Professional analysts were no longer wasting time on data entry, instead using their skills to investigate deeper into the data to uncover meaningful market insights.\n\u201cFor instance, previously when generating cross-functional reporting we had to pool data from multiple locations into Excel, then send it one-by-one to relevant people for feedback. Now, we can push Jet Analytics reports through a central platform like Power BI for easy collaboration. It saves us at least one to two days per week,\u201d said Van Soest.\nCentralized Data Helps Cromology Adapt to Market Demand and Boost Efficiency\nBefore Jet Analytics, Cromology data was siloed within its various business units. Now, Van Soest and his team can cross-analyze data from across the business to find efficiencies.\nPreviously, Demand Planning had limited insight into Sales data, so was basing demand off past seasonal trends. Now, the Demand Planning team can easily analyze real-time Sales data to understand where the demand is and adjust production according to the market focus.\nArmed With Data-Led insights, Sales Has Opened the Door to New Markets\nWith virtually no end-consumer data and often time-consuming analysis of its own data, Sales had limited insight into where, when and what to sell. Now the team can analyze the real-time data to see which clients, products, or geographic areas to target.\n\u201cWe can cross-analyze demographic and sales data to see growth pockets and decide where we want to focus our attention. We only have so many sales staff, spread thinly over 3,000 plus points of sale. Now sales staff can make informed decisions about where to visit. Sales meetings take less time because we can back up our sales pitch with data and provide real market insights to the client. Because we are coming to them with data, customers are happier and trust the information we are giving them, further building that relationship,\u201d said Van Soest.\nCentralized Data Access Significantly Reduced the Load on IT\nPreviously, all data requests had to go through the IT department. It was overloaded with work and often these requests would take too much time to answer. Now there are several other employees empowered to generate their own reports and analysis. Data requests are handled quickly and efficiently, and the IT manager can focus on other high-value initiatives.\nData Transparency Fostered Collaboration and Strong Data Culture\nJet Analytics provides a single source of truth to enable collaboration across all Cromology business units. All employees can access the same data and be confident that it is accurate. Business units can work together efficiently, using the same technical language, without wasting time arguing over whose version of truth is accurate. This transparency has started to build a positive data culture within Cromology. Each business unit is now held accountable for its data practices. Business leaders have started to see the opportunities lying dormant in their data as each new piece of analysis emerges.\nThe access to data leads to more efficient discussions and fact-based decision making,\u201d said Van Soest. \u201cOur push to improve data culture with Jet Analytics has been so successful that I ironically have less time now as every business unit wants to explore its data. I know this is only while they learn the ropes and it will slow down soon, but it\u2019s amazing to see Cromology thrive in this new way of working.\u201d\n"

It designs and manufactures high technology components and systems for the principal original equipment manufacturers in the worldwide aerospace & defence, land vehicle and power & energy markets.\nThe Challenge \nBefore CXO, Senior were using Microsoft Excel linked to its SAP Business Planning and Consolidation (BPC) software for their financial reporting. \u201cThis was a slow and inefficient process that relied on effective data management by individual users,\u201d said Justine Honour, a Group Systems Accountant at Senior. \u201cWhile we were using Excel to the best of our ability, it was difficult to manage version control, and files were being emailed rather than living in one place. As a result, if one didn\u2019t pick up the right email, one wasn\u2019t necessarily looking at the right report.\u201d\n\u201cThe reports weren\u2019t user-friendly either\u201d said Honour, whose team deals with about forty reports on a monthly basis, from twenty-six operating businesses across the globe. They also \u201cincluded narrative sections which are submitted as part of the reports to the Group CFO and CEO\u201d. Narrative was embedded in those Excel reports as BPC doesn\u2019t deal with collecting this data. Collecting and collating this information was time consuming as we had a significant number of people collaborating on the narrative.\u201d\nBuilding to Success with CXO \nSince implementing CXO in 2016, the finance team at Senior has found it much easier to collect and combine input from the Group\u2019s multiple businesses to tell the story behind its numbers. \u201cThe main driving force behind selecting CXO was its narrative capabilities. These capabilities allow us to easily capture explanations for variances and to explain relevant issues beyond the numbers. Now you can just create a storyboard, print it and you\u2019re good to go,\u201d said Honour. \u201cUsing Excel, you\u2019d have to collate forty spreadsheets together and then create PDFs, print the PDFs, and then email them individually. Switching to CXO has eliminated this long process. It easily saved us three days from each monthly reporting cycle.\u201d\n\u201cBeyond this, our company needs reporting to be fast, reliable and consistent; we also liked that we could train users across different parts of our business\u201d, with Honour noting that Senior\u2019s implementation of CXO supports 150 business users across the organization. \u201cThis allows us to use CXO for many things. We have our monthly financial reporting, forecasting, budgets, strategy, and so on. We have several people at head office who use CXO, from the Group Finance team to members of the Executive Committee. In addition, individuals in subsidiaries and health and safety departments use it to access historical figures or environmental numbers.\u201d CXO is also useful for Senior\u2019s KPI reporting, Honour explained. \u201cCXO standardized them and we were also able to create a common scorecard dashboard of KPIs that is used in every meeting. You might have different KPIs that you run, but there is one version used across the company.\u201d\nCXO is now an important part of Senior\u2019s reporting landscape. Honour explained, \u201cthe version of BPC that we\u2019re currently using is out of support in December 2024. Whatever consolidation system we choose to move forward with in the next couple of years, a requirement will be that it must be compatible with CXO. We couldn\u2019t imagine running our month end reporting, and review meetings without it.\u201d\nNavigating Success \nSenior PLC has seen multiple improvements as a result of implementing CXO, including:\n\nThree days shaved from every monthly reporting cycle.\nOne-click narrative capabilities.\nA single reporting definition for guaranteed consistency.\n150 users across the business now have access to centrally maintained reports which are easy to use.\n\n\u201cThe time CXO saved us is definitely days, not hours, off the monthly reporting cycle.\u201d\nAbout Senior \nSenior is an international manufacturing group with operations in 12 countries.

        "content": "\n\nEichenauer Services Inc. has been servicing commercial kitchen maintenance needs, including installation and repair, for over 70 years. Based out of central Illinois, they have the largest service area in the state with branches across 11 cities.\nThe Challenge\nBefore implementing Davisware Analytics powered by Spreadsheet Server, Justin Eichenauer, Director of Operations at Eichenauer Services, had to manually build database views in SQL to support his reporting needs. This was a time-consuming, technical process that took up far too much of his spare time. For example, Eichenauer describes his experience of performing an inventory variance analysis prior to implementing Davisware Analytics: \u201cI would have to build a view in SQL, and then pull it into Excel so that I could analyze it.\u201d These Excel files were made to be shareable around the organization, but some of them \u201cwould get really big,\u201d making it difficult to drill down into detail and making loading and refreshing formulas slow. Eichenauer was looking for a product that would work within Excel and allow fast and easy drilldown when needed.\nEichenauer Services\u2019 ERP field service software provider, Davisware, recommended Davisware Analytics, a real-time reporting solution that integrates directly with GlobalEdge or Vision.\nBuilding upon Success with Davisware Analytics\nDavisware\u2019s software is purpose-built to support the operational and financial needs of commercial food equipment service organizations. As a longtime customer, Eichenauer says that Davisware \u201chas come a long way from where it started and is pretty awesome software.\u201d Adding Davisware Analytics \u201cenhances our ability to function very well in our industry,\u201d allowing Eichenauer to get real-time KPI data in seconds and the most out of their ERP investment.\nEichenauer enjoys the Query Designer feature in Davisware\u2019s Analytcis platform, as it allows him to build reports \u201ca lot easier\u201d\u2014he no longer has to build views in SQL and pull data into Excel, he can just access the data from within Excel via the direct connection to his GlobalEdge software. \u201cEvery time I make a new report, I learn new ways to make it better,\u201d says Eichenauer. \u201cThe longer you use [the solution], the better you get at it.\u201d\nBecause of the dynamic distribution capabilities, Eichenauer enjoys the simplicity of using Davisware Analytics report distribution functionality because he can \u201cjust set a formula to distribute the information whenever [he] need[s].\u201d This allows him to share his reports with his colleagues on a schedule that suits him.\nBeing Excel-based is also \u201ceasier than SQL,\u201d according to Eichenauer, as \u201cyou can\u2019t mess anything up because you aren\u2019t directly messing with the data.\u201d Davisware Analytics suits Eichenauer, as he\u2019s \u201cnot a programmer, but is good at Excel,\u201d and the \u201ceasy usability\u201d of each element of Davisware Analytics means that \u201cyou can do some fun stuff with it.\u201d\n\u201cDavisware Analytics has saved me some time, for sure!\u201d says Eichenauer. \u201cWhenever I was doing stuff before, it was in my own time. I don\u2019t need to do that any longer.\u201d An example of this is how much easier Davisware Analytics makes it to drill down into data. \u201cIf a general ledger (GL) balance is off, I can go in and create a report and figure out what\u2019s going on in the details,\u201d says Eichenauer. \u201cI can quickly go and make any kind of analysis report I want.\u201d Additionally, he enjoys the speed at which he can perform these drilldowns: \u201cWhen I\u2019m in a meeting and someone asks a question, I\u2019m able to pull up numbers off the cuff.\u201d\nNavigating Success \nEichenauer has been able to fulfill their reporting needs as a result of implementing Davisware Analytics , including:\n\nAbility to drill down into data for fast analysis\nFamiliar Excel-interface allows freedom of creativity, without the fear or risks of working directly in SQL\nQuery Designer capability makes \u201cbuilding reports a lot easier\u201d\n\n"

        "content": "\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Bic, commonly referred to as BiC, is a manufacturing corporation based in Clichy, France. The company, founded in 1945 by Marcel Bich, is best known for making consumer products such as stationery products, lighters, and razors.\nMultiple Challenges: Transfer Pricing, Country-by-Country Reporting and ETR Forecasting \u202f \nAs with many multinationals, BiC\u2019s tax data was spread across multiple sources, including HFM, JD Edwards and other local systems. Before implementing Longview Tax, BiC was using time consuming processes to pull together and manipulate financial data used in tax management. For example, Excel was used to compute fees to subsidiaries, requiring manual entries from other financial systems for allocation of management fees. Inna Kostuk,\u202fGroup Tax Director at BiC, said that while they managed with Excel, when it came time to implementing Country-by-Country (CbC) reporting in 2017, they needed a more sophisticated tool to streamline the process.\nMs. Kostuk said \u201cA lot of processes were manual before we started using Longview Tax. This was extremely time consuming for our small tax department and the final checks and different reconciliations were done manually and took more time than expected.\u201d What took the most time was\u202fto\u202fretrieve data for allocation keys\u202fbecause we needed the data of all entities and their structure at BIC is large and complicated. Ms. Kostuk knew that her small team of three couldn\u2019t easily meet the needs of CbC reporting, particularly because the data required was not automatically available in the HFM group consolidation system.\nThe team was looking for something to simplify and secure the process. As they searched for a new solution, Ms. Kostuk noted that there wasn\u2019t much on the market at the time. BiC needed something that was\u202feasy to integrate with their existing finance systems. Other solutions they considered weren\u2019t viable because they required multiple products to be bolted together or weren\u2019t flexible enough to meet Ms. Kostuk and her team\u2019s needs.\nBuilding a Centralized Tax Database with\u202fLongview Tax\u202f\nMs. Kostuk said that thanks to Longview Tax \u201cwhat took around one week for allocation before, now takes one day.\u201d She said that the most\u202ftime-consuming\u202fpart of the intercompany recharge was removed from the allocation process, and they can now take the whole balance sheet and P&L from the consolidation system\u202fand upload it directly into\u202fLongview Tax.\nLongview Tax also enabled Ms. Kostuk\u2019s team to reduce the risk of introducing human errors into their process, she said. Before they implemented Longview Tax, they\u2019d import and manipulate information manually. Now the data load and intercompany recharge calculations are done automatically, so the probability of errors is much lower than before. She said her team can now \u201cupload large volumes of data into the software and easily make manual adjustments where required.\u201d\nMs. Kostuk said the stress of having a small team on a tight deadline is that sometimes the amount of work required for a quick turnaround can be overwhelming. \u201cWith Longview Tax we know we can complete the work on time. This is something the whole team appreciates. We are now confident that we can manage our workload.\u201d\nNavigating Success\u202f\nBiC has seen number of improvements as a result of implementing Longview Tax, including:\n\nWhat took \u201cone week\u2026 now takes one day.\u201d Longview Tax offers huge time savings.\n\u201cThe probability of errors is low.\u201d Greatly reduced scope for human error.\n\u201cWe can manage our workload.\u201d CbC reporting and complicated calculations are now possible for small tax teams.\n\u201cIt was\u202freally easy\u202fto implement.\u201d Small teams can hit the ground running.\n\n"

        "company": "Leading Global Manufacturer",
        "content": "\nThe Challenge \nBack in 2009 the parent company of a leading US-based, global manufacturer implemented Longview Tax. The Longview Tax Solution replaced a cumbersome and inefficient Excel-based system with a more flexible solution that was able to more effectively handle the needs of a business with numerous foreign subsidiaries and an active mergers and acquisitions program.\nIn 2020, the parent company sold off the manufacturer and it became an independent business. While preparing for the company\u2019s separation, the director of tax technology knew he didn\u2019t want to return to a spreadsheet-based provisioning process because he felt this would have opened up the business to a lot of unnecessary risk. With multiple spreadsheet files to manage, the team would have been exposed to the risk of errors caused by manual processes, as well as lacking version control over their data. From experience when he worked for the parent company, the director of tax technology knew that Longview Tax would avoid all these issues. He said it enabled them to fulfill exactly what they wanted\u2013having a system that would capture all their provisions and provide visibility through purpose-built reports and web-based dashboards.\nBuilding to Success with Longview Tax \nThe director of tax technology was able to take what had been implemented in Longview Tax previously as a starting point and began to adapt it to suit his new role. While the biggest challenge for implementation in his previous role was connecting the many General Ledgers from across the company into Longview, the opposite was true for his new role. Moving all the data into one GL in his new role created the opportunity for a more streamlined approach to data management, increasing usage of features such as automation, which could be fulfilled by Longview Tax.\nBeyond their successful implementation of Longview Tax, the director of tax technology said that it is also being used outside of provisioning. He noted that some people use Longview for restructuring, pulling in restructuring currencies (from accrual and cash spend for example), into one project. This makes it easier for his team to analyze this data and says it is a good way to consolidate information worldwide.\nElsewhere, Longview Tax is being used as a data-collection tool, and the director of tax technology notes it is also being used to create templates for non-US audits. The director of tax technology explained it gives those at their head office the visibility to know which audit closed when, its outcome, and how this compares to what they expected, without having to ask for this information from whichever constituency it originated from.\nLongview Tax functions at all levels of the company\u2013it is even used to collect information for the annual report. This director of tax technology was impressed that they could use it and develop it for multiple levels of the organization for anything they needed.\nNavigating Success with Longview Tax\nLongview Tax made it easy for this leading global manufacturer to manage their provisioning process, including:\n\nStreamlining GL data collection\u2013allowing head office employees deeper insight into the provisioning process.\nEasy transferal\u2013once they became independent, it was a simple job to transfer the elements built in Longview Tax over to their new implementation.\nEasy to use\u2013any new contributors could pick up Longview Tax with ease, thanks to its purpose-built features and web-based dashboards, rather than having to get up to speed with complex and cumbersome spreadsheet packages.\n\n"

As a full-service event coordination and rental operation, Party Rent Group hosts a diverse range of functions across Europe that vary in size and complexity, from intimate receptions to full scale trade shows.\nA Tale of Copy/Pasting Growing Pains\nParty Rent Group enjoyed\u00a0success\u00a0and\u00a0significant\u00a0growth through the\u00a02000s and\u00a02010s.\u00a0As time progressed,\u00a0that growth had vastly\u00a0outpaced their ability to scale or\u00a0meet the volume of demand\u00a0from their customers.\u00a0The problem centered around the fact that their\u00a0enterprise resource planning (ERP) software\u00a0wasn\u2019t geared toward reporting against\u00a0a rental\u00a0business model.\u00a0To\u00a0make the ERP work, employees\u00a0resorted to a tedious\u00a0manual\u00a0process of\u00a0copy/pasting\u00a0reports together, a\u00a0practice that was\u00a0time consuming and error prone.\nFrank Rabe,\u00a0logistics\u00a0manager,\u00a0at Party Rent Group\u2019s Berlin location,\u00a0put it simply,\u00a0\u201cit was a very hard copy and paste job.\u201d\u00a0But that simple description underscores\u00a0the depth of the problem.\u00a0This copy/paste problem extended throughout the entire company, from management reporting\u00a0and\u00a0financial\u00a0analysis,\u00a0all the way down to daily operations in the warehouse and order\u00a0fulfillment.\u00a0\u201cWe had a big ERP system, but the ERP did not deliver the data we needed.\u00a0We\u00a0had to copy everything manually. We had a few people and a huge amount of paperwork,\u201d said Rabe.\nProducing\u00a0monthly\u00a0financial\u00a0reports\u00a0for the\u00a0leadership team\u00a0was a monumental task.\u00a0At the time, the company had a highly experienced controller that\u00a0committed one\u00a0week\u00a0of\u00a0every month\u00a0to\u00a0assembling\u00a0financial reports by\u00a0copy/pasting data into spreadsheets. It was a waste to utilize that person\u2019s skill and experience on such a\u00a0menial\u00a0task.\u00a0Eventually\u00a0that person left the company out of frustration.\nLooking for a way to alleviate the strain,\u00a0Rabe\u00a0sought\u00a0help from a\u00a0business consultant. That\u00a0service\u00a0came with a big price tag\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0ultimately arrived at the same data roadblock. The\u00a0consultancy\u00a0needed a lot of data\u00a0in order to\u00a0improve the internal processes that they were hired to fix.\u00a0According to Rabe,\u00a0\u201cthere was a lot of manual paperwork. There were a lot of orders.\u00a0In the end, the consultancy determined that\u00a0we\u00a0could improve the business through better data management.\u201d\u00a0The consultancy suggested they\u00a0take a look\u00a0at Jet Analytics.\nJet Analytics Hosts a Goodbye Party for Paperwork \nThe operation was nearing a breaking point\u2013tuck in a cycle of manual, paper processes that couldn\u2019t keep up with the volume of orders. There were times when work in the warehouses halted to a standstill because paper inventory sheets could not be generated fast enough.\nIt was at this point that Party Rent Group connected with insightsoftware partner datenkultur to help reduce their paperwork load and modernize their processes. Andreas Koblischke, CEO at datenkultur, oversaw the process of integrating data from their ERP to the Jet Analytics data model. But there was one problem: the ERP system was in Dutch and every table in the ERP could only contain a maximum of eight characters. Essentially, the ERP system was a huge application that used complex abbreviations in a foreign language.\ndatenkultur supervised the task of translating every table, line by line, while developing specialized Power BI dashboards based on the Jet Analytics data warehouse. The results of the implementation were transformative. \u201cIt was the first time that they got their data in the perfect form. This was never a possibility before,\u201d said Koblischke. He went onto say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t hire new people, they used their existing staff in a totally different way. It was much more efficient, it saved a lot of money, a lot of time, and it solved a lot of problems.\u201d\nIn total, Party Rent Group experienced savings of more than \u20ac200K per year in their Berlin location alone, by implementing Jet. By automating manual processes and eliminating the physical paperwork from their business model, they eliminated the need to schedule overtime staff and hire outside contractors to fulfill the copy/paste workload.\nPositive changes were felt throughout the company. Employees found new motivation because they disliked the old manual process and now they got to use modern tools like iPads throughout the course of their workday. On the warehouse floor, Rabe said, \u201cthe data eliminated a lot of problems, improved communication, eliminated the copy/paste errors.\u201d\nThe timing of the integration also proved to be very fortuitous. Since the transition was completed before the pandemic, the management team was able to work remotely while a small team of staff members in the warehouse maintained operations.

With more than 25,000 customers over Europe, the company provides products with an array of custom labelling solutions\u2013including three-dimensional fonts, metallic and plastic logos, paper labels and foils with digital functionalities\u2013for companies from industry and retail, as well as service providers.\nThe Challenge\nRathgeber had been successfully using Jet Reports for their reporting solution for many years, but were experiencing difficulty getting what they needed out of their front-end BI and analytics tool. \u201cWe had a BI and analytics tool in place but we were finding it challenging to get things done, quickly and cost-effectively\u201d said Alan Phipps, the company\u2019s Business Analyst. The Rathgeber Group has been using Microsoft Dynamics NAV on-prem with Jet Reports since he started at the company in 2008. \u201cWe were always faced with going to an external partner to get changes in the cubes implemented. It was always tricky communicating what we needed from \u201cNAV\u201d to \u201ccube\u201d language. This was costing a lot of time, with a lot of back and forth, even for small changes. Ultimately it was too much.\u201d Phipps explained that the license structure (price and quantity) was also hindering the wider use of the BI tool in the company as it would have been too costly.\nMore importantly, The Rathgeber Group saw the opportunity to get more from their data. \u201cWe had the information we wanted, but it wasn\u2019t always accessible. When we set up our previous analytics software, the idea was that we would get it to run twice a day,\u201d said Phipps. \u201cHowever, it always took an unpredictable amount of time to update. Sometimes it was fairly quick, around one hour. Other times it would take three hours. We ended up killing this mid-day run, as it didn\u2019t help anybody because we never knew when it would be finished. We absolutely love Jet Reports, it gives us the freedom to access NAV data directly in Excel and create our own financial reports. But, for company-wide analysis, with regular daily updates, we knew we needed a BI solution.\u201d\nBuilding to Success with Jet Analytics\nPhipps wanted to get control of the BI into his own hands. He could easily generate any report in Jet Reports, and he wanted an analytics software that was just as easy to understand; easy enough for himself and the CFO to administer themselves. \u201cAfter visiting Business Systemhaus (BSH) and talking to them a few times, we knew had a good solution and had found a great partner. We had three days on-site training with their consultant, where on day one, we were already hands-on with the software. Within three days of installing Jet Analytics, it was connected with Dynamics system, and we had the first cubes up-and-running,\u201d said Phipps. \u201cMyself and the CFO do most of the changes ourselves now. Adding tables or fields, or creating new measures and dimensions is getting just as easy as using Jet Reports. Of course, we\u2019re not techies or SQL experts, so there are always a few things where we need some extra help. For that, we have BSH. They always respond quickly and watching their guys set things up, sometimes I feel like they are working in fast forward. We have a support contract with BSH for a couple of hours a month, this covers the really tricky stuff. In total we are way more cost and time efficient. It\u2019s great (not to mention, fun) being able to do most of the changes ourselves though, when we want to.\u201d\n\u201cWith Jet Analytics, we are able to run an update every hour! This is a great advantage for our production sites. The cube update takes only about seven to eight minutes.\u201d said Phipps. \u201cThat\u2019s despite having way more information in the cubes than we had in our previous BI tool.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re really happy, for several reasons. Power BI is a great tool and it\u2019s really easy to create the dashboards we want. This is, in large, due to the fact that we created the cubes ourselves using Jet Analytics, and really understand the data and the structure, so we\u2019re quicker at implementing changes. It only \u201ccosts\u201d us our time, and we\u2019re getting quicker and better every day. Adding new users is simple.\u201d Phipps went on to say that \u201ca huge win is that management is happy. Whereas before hardly anyone was using the BI tool, now we can see that Power BI has really been accepted. We get requests for changes and for new reports regularly. We also see our reports being used directly in meetings. This saves me time as I no longer have to create extra reports and PowerPoints for meetings. Our Managing Director is also happy. We\u2019ve 4 companies using the same unified reporting tool! Last but not least, he\u2019s also happy because it\u2019s costing the company less!\u201d\nNavigating Success \nThe Rathgeber Group has seen a number of improvements as a result of implementing Jet Analytics, including:\n\nOwnership and control of reporting and analytics is now in-house.\nReliable, efficient hourly reporting to underpin decision making.\nCost savings and cost transparency.\nBetter understanding and use of data across the whole organization.\n\n"

It was a lot of back and forth between different departments in the company, and also with clients,\u201d said Florian Brunet-Lecomte, President, describing Femat\u2019s previous reporting process with Microsoft Dynamics NAV and later with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. \u201cAs a distributor we needed to create and adapt lots of reports and we were struggling.\u201d\n\u201cThe building materials market in France is 50 billion Euros a year and the part we operate in is worth about four billion Euros. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s a small market, but it\u2019s a very specialized area, and we need to be able to communicate properly\u201d said Brunet-Lecomte. \u201cWe were processing a lot of information but we were not able to use it to its fullest. We saw the need to have better access to information so that we could do our work more efficiently if we wanted our business to be successful. So, we decided to look for something new.\u201d\nBuilding to Success with Jet Analytics\nAt first, Femat turned to Jet Reports for help. \u201cWe automatically exported the data from Microsoft Dynamics NAV, and we scheduled the reports through Jet. I received the information every day and the team received it either every morning, or weekly on a Monday morning. It really helped eliminate our manual reporting processes, but we wanted to go further and have even better analysis capabilities.\u201d\n\u201cWe added Power BI and Jet Analytics in 2019 and it has made our operations a lot smoother,\u201d said Brunet-Lecomte. \u201cThe combination of these products helps us analyze our data, eliminates most manual processes, and simplifies our ability to generate the reporting we need and ultimately enables us to visualize everything easily in Power BI.\u201d\nSince the implementation of Jet Analytics, Femat has been able to get more value out of their data by enabling more people in the company to engage with and use the data. \u201cYou need to really understand the KPIs your business has in place,\u201d said Brunet-Lecomte. \u201cOnce you have visibility of your KPIs, then you need to be able to access the data behind the headline numbers. If your KPIs area static data, it is hard to do anything with them, and it is hard to understand what they are telling you. With Jet Analytics, we can really work with our KPIs to understand our business and to evolve them over time to ensure we are tracking the right numbers. Jet Analytics allows everyone in the company to really engage with what is happening and make improvements where we need them. This is the key to a successful business.\u201d\nNavigating Success \nFemat has seen better data engagement as a result of implementing Jet Analytics, including:\n\nTime savings from eliminating manual processes and static spreadsheets.\nStronger company interaction with data across departments.\nGreat report presentation quality.\nReal-time reporting.\n\nFor Femat, the impact of Jet Reports and Jet Analytics has been profound. The company has transformed from one where data was somebody else\u2019s job, to one where everyone uses data and KPI\u2019s daily to drive performance and improve the business, and Jet Analytics has enabled the team to use Power BI to visualize their data in ways that were not possible with Power BI alone.\n"

        "content": "\n\nDistrict heating is a popular source of renewable energy for urban areas throughout Sweden. A district heating system consists of an underground infrastructure of insulated pipelines that provide thermal energy supplied by a central power plant to commercial and residential buildings in a municipality. \u00d6rebro based V\u00e4rmev\u00e4rden/Adven has 520 employees managing 350 sites to provide heating, renewable energy, industrial energy and waste recovery solutions for private customers, municipalities, industries and apartment complexes across Sweden, Finland, Norway, Netherlands and the Baltics.\nThe Challenge \nDelivering comfortable and environmentally friendly heat to a customer base that borders the Arctic Circle is no easy task. The demand is high there are many obstacles that can curtail or delay operations. For V\u00e4rmev\u00e4rden\u2019s Manager of Finance IT, Gustaf Roman, the challenges of the financial team centered around a lack of flexibility within their ERP that made it difficult to tailor to the needs of their business, and a locally developed third party planning solution that was enlisted to support the system.\nAccording to Roman, \u201cWe wanted stability and flexibility, and we wanted the possibility to grow. That wasn\u2019t possible with the current solution. And we struggled to adapt our ERP to fit the needs of the business.\u201d V\u00e4rmev\u00e4rden, like other companies operating in the energy services sector, faces challenges with procurement of raw fuels, regulatory hurdles, and tax requirements \u2013 all of which are in a constant state of fluctuation. \u201cA large portion of our cost is fuel and the supply of various kinds of fuels. It\u2019s quite a complex process,\u201d said Roman.\nTo further complicate matters, Roman explained that the company was at the early stages of an ERP switch. V\u00e4rmev\u00e4rden, through a series of acquisitions, found itself manually feeding data from six different ERPs into their old planning system. This made it difficult to manage the legacy data that each company contributed to the group. As a result, their existing planning solution was unable to keep up with the volume and complexity of their growing operation.\nBuilding to Success with Bizview \nDrawing on his 20+ years of experience with business intelligence and finance, Roman arrived at a decision to deploy Bizview as its budgeting, planning, forecasting, and reporting solution that would tie the pieces of the complex operation together. Bizview was used to consolidate data from the various legacy ERPs and build dashboards connected to the company\u2019s central figures. This is where the team found the flexibility, visibility, and access that was impossible with their previous solution. It also opened the door to a new level of control and individual ownership of the company\u2019s data. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for the end users (V\u00e4rmev\u00e4rden employees) to support and fill the system with information,\u201d said Roman.\nWith the greater access to key metrics that were previously difficult to obtain, Roman leveraged Bizview to ramp up forecasting. According to Roman, \u201cWe can use different indexes per account group and different sections in the income statement and balance sheet. We forecast both income statement and balance sheet through Bizview, and it\u2019s possible to forecast for longer periods than we could look at before.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cWe are doing monthly forecasting for the entire group (of companies) and that is no problem. There are two people that are working with this, and they are easily able to reforecast within a couple of hours.\u201d\nCompanies within the energy services sector operate in a constant state of flux, and V\u00e4rmev\u00e4rden is no exception. Their drive for expansion and ongoing acquisitions gives the finance team little time to relax between cycles. Fortunately, Bizview brings some much-needed relief by simplifying time-consuming processes, allowing the team to focus on value-added activities such as forecasting and analysis. Roman has some advice for companies that are struggling to extract useful insights from their ERP: \u201cIf you want a flexible tool that is possible to scale, one that is easy to change and maintain yourself, then I would consider Bizview.\u201d\nNavigating Success\nBizview gave V\u00e4rmev\u00e4rden valuable forecasting tools that enabled growth.\n\nTime savings \u2013 Monthly forecasting shrunk from 3 days to 3 hours.\nFlexibility \u2013 Ability to run models with multiple variables and scenarios.\nStability \u2013 Effectively manages an operation with 350 sites.\nData Consolidation \u2013 Merged data from 6 ERPs into one forecasting model.\n\nV\u00e4rmev\u00e4rden\u2019s implementation of Bizview offered \u201cA huge leap forward\u201d in financial operations.\n"

        "company": "Speedy Services",
        "content": "\n\nOperating since 1977, Speedy Services is the UK\u2019s largest provider of tools, plant, and specialist equipment available for hire. With over 3,500 product lines, they hire out tools and equipment suitable for just about every profession, as soon as four hours after customers make a request.\nThe Challenge\nSpeedy Services had been using Atlas since before Damian Grundy, IT project team manager, joined over six years ago. Originally, they implemented Atlas as a data uploading tool. Grundy recalls that the \u201ccomplex and convoluted\u201d process in their Microsoft Dynamics AX12 ERP system was \u201ctime-intensive, with lots of fields to populate\u201d in their input templates. While this could be bearable on an ad hoc basis, the team produced around 100-200 of these uploads per day, which was time-consuming as this could take anywhere from two minutes per product to 25 minutes per product.\nThe team needed a solution that could automatically recreate their recurring uploads (rather than having to recreate them from scratch each time), and that could move these updates into their system automatically. Atlas gave them these capabilities enabling their finance team to create and manage their own uploads into their AX system from within the familiar Microsoft Excel environment, without requiring deep technical skills.\nAs the Speedy Services team was about to upgrade from Dynamics AX to Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain (D365), Grundy knew that retaining Atlas would be key to the success of their migration.\nBuilding to Success with Atlas\nWhile Grundy acknowledges that the finance team are \u201cbig fans of Excel,\u201d he feels that adding Atlas makes it far easier for them to prepare bulk updates as \u201cit\u2019s quicker than doing it line-by-line in a spreadsheet\u201d. This helps solve one of the key challenges of being a business that hires out its assets, which as Grundy notes \u201cmany IT systems don\u2019t like things coming in and out of the system.\u201d Atlas gives them the flexibility to capture and upload asset data in a way that reflects how their business works. This capability means that they are in a more comfortable place than they were six years ago when Grundy joined.\nSpeedy Services weren\u2019t looking toward an alternative to Atlas before migrating, as maintaining its usage is a key driver to a successful migration. Keeping an environment familiar to the Finance team allows minimal interruption to data uploads, so they don\u2019t have to change how all those uploads flow into the ERP, extending the project, changing more processes, and adding to stress among the users. Now that Speedy Services are looking to move to D365, they are keen to bring Atlas with them to help with the migration and to ensure they have the same capabilities that the team values from their AX deployment with D365. The Finance team are keen to keep Atlas, and Grundy agrees, saying \u201cthe users are accustomed to it and really like it.\u201d \u201cImplementing without Atlas would add around three months to the migration project,\u201d estimates Grundy, also pointing out that \u201cany change causes resistance, and Atlas helps the migration.\u201d Grundy knows that \u201cuntil we get Atlas, we\u2019re not going live [with D365].\u201d Any new ERP can be daunting to Finance, but \u201cAtlas gives them that security blanket.\u201d\nAs Speedy Services works to modernize processes across their business, IT are keen to give Finance autonomy over their own data and reporting, and Atlas allows trained users to remain \u201cin charge of their own data,\u201d according to Grundy, rather than \u201ceverything being an IT responsibility.\u201d\nCurrently, Speedy Services use Atlas in a number of applications, \u201cincluding Lightspeed (a mobile solution), mobile PDAs, and for transfers and collections.\u201d So integrated is Atlas to Speedy Services, that they even use it for timesheets, as it just simplifies processes such as these. Often, Atlas is used \u201cfor fixing anything on a bulk basis very quickly.\u201d Atlas is easy for the Finance team to use for data uploading\u2013Grundy notes that \u201cusers like a simplified interface, and Atlas just shows them the fields they have to update. Simplifying anything for users is a win.\u201d Atlas gives the users \u201cvalidation to know that the data is accurate.\u201d\nAnnata, a leading Microsoft partner, has been assisting Speedy Hire with the D365 migration project. Grundy applauds them for \u201calways being on call\u201d, adding that \u201cwe couldn\u2019t have done it on time and to budget without them.\u201d Grundy also notes that \u201cAtlas is a key topic of discussion at every migration meeting.\u201d\nWhile Power BI is great for many departments, Grundy knows that \u201cone solution doesn\u2019t fit all,\u201d with Atlas being ideally suited to the custom reporting and uploading needs of finance.\nNavigating Success\nAtlas has been central to the success of the finance team at Speedy Services, to the extent that they would not consider upgrading to D365 without being able to use Atlas:\n\nTime-saver: not only does Atlas eliminate time-consuming, manual report building, but it also saves time after the team moves to the Cloud, because for many users Atlas serves as their interface with the ERP, so keeping the same interface means these users don\u2019t need to be retrained.\nFamiliar: Users appreciate the familiarity of Atlas and that they won\u2019t be forced to change the workflows and processes they know and understand.\nVersatile: Atlas works with both their legacy, on-premise ERP (AX) and their new Cloud ERP (D365)\nAllows Finance autonomy: Finance retains ownership over their own data and reporting, without having to rely on IT.\nEasy to use: A simplified, familiar Excel-based interface means it\u2019s easy for the Finance team to navigate.\n\n"

        "content": "\n\nWebSan Solutions Inc. is known for its customer service and software solutions. With offices in Toronto, Canada, and Tennessee, USA, they are a premier Microsoft GOLD Dynamics Certified Partner and IT consulting and solutions provider. They can trace their Dynamics heritage back through GP and NAV, and today they are focused on helping their clients implement Microsoft Dynamics Business Central. Their team consists of more than forty professionals, with multiple decades of combined experience in the areas of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and IT consulting. \nThe Challenge \n\u201cCustomer satisfaction is at the heart of everything WebSan does,\u201d said Andrew King, Managing Director, WebSan Solutions Inc, a Microsoft partner since 2008 and an insightsoftware Jet partner since August, 2020. When WebSan implements Business Central, King explains, \u201cwe want to provide our customers with a complete solution that meets all their needs. That\u2019s why we developed a suite of pre-built Power BI dashboards to speed up the delivery of management information.\u201d However, where WebSan sees gaps, King said, \u201cwe look for complementary technology to ensure our client\u2019s success. Financial reporting is one such area.\u201d \nWith financial reporting King explains, \u201cthe out of the box reports don\u2019t give finance professionals the flexibility they need. While software like Power BI is great for dashboards and management reports, it doesn\u2019t hit the mark for finance. A lot of times, finance users end up dumping data into Excel, because that\u2019s where they feel most comfortable. So, why not let them start in Excel? That\u2019s why we show them Jet Reports, because we know it gives finance what they want.\u201d \nBuilding to Success with Jet Reports \nAs Microsoft continues to grow its Business Central market share, it needs a network of partners it can rely on who have developed fast, repeatable implementation processes. WebSan certainly fits this mold. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty rinse, wash, repeat with our sales, but very focused on ensuring that what we offer clients is beneficial,\u201d said King. \u201cQuite early on, we realized that the Business Central financial reporting wasn\u2019t great, one of the complaints we often had from clients was that they would get stuck setting up reports. This was something we knew we had to address. And so, we looked at Jet Reports, which we kept encountering through our NAV customers, and said, \u2018this is great\u2019.\u201d\nNow WebSan has integrated Jet Reports as part of its standard offer to clients. \u201cWe have these fixed fee implementation plans. With them, we tell our clients that we\u2019re so adamant that Jet Reports will make them happier that we make it a mandatory part of our offer,\u201d said King. WebSan also developed a library of best practice reports to ensure their client\u2019s success and to accelerate their implementation process. \u201cWe created a massive catalog of about 85 reports that we offer as a bundle that the client can instantly start using. When we sell Jet Reports, we give the clients the entire catalog and we record some training videos to help them get started.\u201d\nThis process has been very successful for WebSan and its clients. \u201cHaving Jet Reports saves us days of implementation work, and it is enables our clients to quickly take ownership of their financial reporting. We get almost no post-integration support calls regarding Jet Reports,\u201d said King. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about giving the client what they need.\u201d Since they began selling Jet Reports last year, they\u2019ve taken on nineteen new clients with 100% satisfaction. WebSan was recognized by Microsoft as 2021 Partner of the Year for Dynamics 365 Business Central. King attributes this to \u201cthe large number of happy, new Business Central customers we have implemented over the past year. We feel Jet Reports has played a significant role in this success, because it addresses all our clients\u2019 financial reporting needs.\u201d\nNavigating Success \nWebSan has been able to build on the success of their Microsoft Dynamics Business Central practice by implementing Jet Reports for their clients, leading them to:\n\nSave days of implementation work with each new client, enabling them to onboard more customers, more quickly.\nEnsure 100% client satisfaction with the Jet Reports Bundle for financial reporting.\nGive clients ownership of their financial reports, which leads to less support calls, saving time for both WebSan and its clients.\nAdd value to Business Central by solving clients financial reporting challenges while complementing Power BI.\n\n"

        "content": "\n\nA pioneer in distributing consolidation and reporting solutions in the cloud since its creation in 2005, Viareport ensures the management of financial applications for over 800 corporations. Thanks to its diverse solutions combining cloud-based applications with an expertise in consulting services, Viareport has established itself as the reference financial consolidation and management reporting platform in France and overseas.\nClarins at a Glance \nClarins is a company that designs, manufactures and sells high-end beauty products. It is the leader in the European cosmetics market. This family-owned company was founded in 1954 by Jacques Courtin-Clarins. Clarins Group is especially present in perfumeries and department stores thanks to its distribution contracts.\nContext \nWith almost 1,000 lease contracts in France and overseas, Clarins must comply with IFRS 16 requirements and was obliged to do so when this standard came into effect on January 1st, 2019.\nOnce it had performed an initial listing of all of its lease contracts Clarins Group quickly realized that it was unable to manage and monitor all of them over time.\n\u201cWe have over 900 lease contracts. We could have chosen to centralize all of these lease contracts in Excel at a certain point in time, but our teams warned us early of the limitations of this tool. Excel cannot be used to monitor these lease contracts throughout their lifetime, including contract terms, changes in amounts, extensions or renewals,\u201d says Beno\u00eet Daget, Director of Consolidation.\nBased on this observation, Clarins decided to approach different market players in order to find an appropriate solution to their problems.\n\u201cWe reached the conclusion that we definitely needed an application dedicated to the management of our lease contracts,\u201d says Daget.\nThe Choice of Tool \n\u201cWe decided on Lease very quickly. I was already aware of Viareport\u2019s reputation, and I knew that it was a well-established player in the market. I had also heard many good things about Lease which had already been in existence for several years, and which managed IAS 17 lease contracts when the initial version was released. It was very reassuring and encouraging for us to know that the solution had already proved its worth in the past, unlike other rival solutions. Moreover, the sales presentation, with its product demonstration and financial proposal, was very convincing,\u201d says Daget.\nThe Project \nClarins Group wanted all of its lease contracts to be integrated in the tool by December 2018 so that their teams could be operationally ready for the application on January 1st, 2019. The project started in September 2018 and was punctuated by weekly project committee meetings between Clarins Group and Viareport consultants.\n\u201cThe Lease implementation project started in a very busy period of time when all software publishers and integrators were much sought after to help businesses comply with IFRS 16. We were lucky to have a dedicated Viareport consultant who oversaw the entire project. This ensured that we had access to a single contact who was highly responsive and available. We never felt that we were left to fend for ourselves because we always had someone who could answer our questions,\u201d says Daget.\nAll Clarins consolidation teams were trained to use the application. The first training sessions were classroom-based for the Paris teams. Later, there were three distance learning sessions for the subsidiaries in Asia, America and Europe.\n\u201cThe sessions with the overseas subsidiaries were a success thanks to a highly effective distance learning tool and a competent trainer with a versatile skill set. We had to train several tens of users overseas and it was more financially viable for us to do so via video conferencing,\u201d says Daget.\n\u201cWe were very satisfied with the support provided by Viareport. In this type of project, there are two very important aspects. Firstly, the relationship with the sales consultant, and secondly, the competence of the consultant in charge of the project,\u201d says Daget.\nThe Benefits \n1. Management of changes in contracts and traceability of modifications\n\u201cThe solution developed by Viareport enables us today to monitor changes in our contracts in real-time and to set up the required alerts.\u201d\n2. Multi-dimensional analyses of the impact of lease contracts\nThe solution developed by Viareport includes innovative analysis functionalities, namely Web Analyzer, a data retrieval tool.\nThis tool is used to create Web pivot tables by dragging and dropping analysis dimensions to the columns and rows you want. It also enables you to audit the amounts retrieved within each analysis simply by clicking the relevant amount.\u201cThe Web Analyzer functionality was a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s a powerful tool that enables us to perform simulations on lease contracts over several years easily.\u201d\n3. Generation of restatement journal entries associated with IFRS 16\nLease generates restatement journal entries in compliance with accounting standards that are easy to interface with Group accounting or consolidation software.\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, Lease will enable us to use cross-reference mapping tables to map our IFRS 16 restatement journal entries automatically with our accounting systems using the tool\u2019s journal entry extraction module.\u201d\n4. Continuous version upgrades\nLease is enhanced with new functionalities every month. The development of this application is part of our continual improvement process in fulfilling the needs of users.\n\u201cAvailable as a cloud-based application, Lease is a versatile and flexible tool. This is one of the points that won us over in the past, and today, we are convinced of the effectiveness of this agile approach. We have seen positive developments to the solution over time.\u201d\n\u201cI recommend Lease whole-heartedly as a tool for centralizing lease contracts in compliance with IFRS 16 requirements. I am totally satisfied with the performance of the application. If the size of your Group is similar to that of Clarins, then Lease is the solution adapted to your needs.\u201d\nRequest a free demo.\n"

Sylvia De Vries, Program Director for Finance Transformation at OUTsurance, recalls that prior to implementing Certent CDM, the reporting process was \u201cincredibly laborious and manual,\u201d and required a combination of Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, PowerPoint, and OneSource to pull together the numbers and narrative. \u201cThis affected the auditability, and if you made one change it didn\u2019t all flow through automatically.\u201d\nThey were also facing additional risks due to rapid changes with the Financial Services Institute and other regulators. \u201cOrganizations need to be flexible and agile enough to respond to these changes,\u201d states De Vries, \u201cand OUTsurance weren\u2019t able to easily meet these demands.\u201d\nAt the time, De Vries was looking for a system that would \u201chelp us be more automated.\u201d Beginning their journey in March 2020, they had three months to go until year-end reporting and \u201cthe benefits of implementing CDM outweighed the risks of going through the old manual process, even with the added pressure of remote deployment.\u201d\nBuilding to Success with Certent CDM\nOUTsurance had some tight timescales for their Certent CDM implementation because of both having a junior team and needing the product ready in time for their year-end reporting. Their implementation began in March 2020, which coincided with the first COVID-19 lockdown, and everyone had to adapt to remote working.\nThey worked with an insightsoftware customer solutions team expert, Sunet Leimecke, who De Vries describes as \u201cvery experienced and asked the correct questions, which assisted in getting the scoping correct.\u201d This scoping was important so the team knew they would be able to have the project up and running successfully in time for year-end reporting.\n\u201cIn the new world of COVID, Certent provided training virtually \u2013 this was very successful considering it was new territory for everyone,\u201d explains De Vries. With everyone newly working from home, OUTsurance were still able to complete the implementation and successfully understand their new Certent CDM product completely. \u201cWe went into a lot of detail about the template for annual financial statements (because that\u2019s what the project required), as well as the data sources,\u201d recalls De Vries. The finance team was heavily involved in the project, so that, once the template had been created, responsibility could be handed off to them.\n\u201cCertent CDM has helped improve the agility and speed at which we implement new regulatory reporting requirements,\u201d says De Vries. Certent also enabled \u201cXBRL tagging and all the things that go alongside reporting to make sure it all comes together to meet the quality of reporting that\u2019s required,\u201d continues De Vries. \u201cThe ease of seeing any issues with number formatting prior to submission, saves a lot of time.\u201d\nOne of the main benefits of implementing Certent CDM was the fact that it links directly to the data source. \u201cAs soon as you refresh from the SQL table, it automatically updates Certent CDM,\u201d says De Vries, \u201cwhich was a huge time saving for us.\u201d The Excel file then updates straight away \u2013 \u201cthere\u2019s no hard pasting of numbers, it\u2019s all very interactive,\u201d remarks De Vries.\nNavigating Success \nOUTsurance has seen marked improvement in their reporting process as a result of implementing Certent CDM, including:\n\nSingle source of truth: \u201cCDM not only streamlines the individual company\u2019s financial statement process, but also the consolidation process for our group financial statements. It has assisted with ensuring the numbers we report on are up to date and consistent across companies.\u201d \u2013 Caitlin Hanaghan, Group Finance at OUTsurance.\nFast time to value: Implementation, including training and delivering annual reports, in under three months.\nTime savings: Can see any issues with formatting prior to submitting reports and cut out the manual data dumping.\nStandardization: Able to standardize reporting across the organization, linking all the values instead of pasting and cross-referencing from the detailed financial statements to the supporting footnotes.\nReal-time data updates: No more manual updates.\n\n"

        "company": "Caymas Boats",
        "content": "\n\nCaymas Boats, founded by legendary boat racer Earl Bentz in 2018 in Ashland City, Tennessee, is a manufacturer of high-quality, custom fiberglass fishing boats. Supplying both saltwater and freshwater boats, the company is experiencing increasing demand, and recently began building a new factory in order to increase capacity.\nThe Challenge \nBefore implementing Spreadsheet Server, Caymas Boats was using Epicor ERP\u2019s standard reports alongside Epicor XL Connect, a Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae add-in, for their more in-depth and custom reporting needs. Tyler Smith, Senior Accountant at Caymas Boats, says that while the team liked using Epicor XL Connect, when it came time to create or modify their reports, they had to rely on outside consultants because report writing still required a level of technical expertise.\nPaying outside consultants to manage their reports just wasn\u2019t sustainable for the company\u2014no matter how skilled your technical consultants are, it\u2019s impossible for them to know and understand a business as well as the people who work there every day, which slows the process down, so paying hourly rates to consultants would have been \u201cvery expensive\u201d according to Smith. Instead, Smith and the team found themselves resorting to data dumps into Excel where they could manually configure and format the reports they needed, choosing to sacrifice only time, rather than both time and money.\nThe team was looking to \u201cupgrade their technology,\u201d and knew that they \u201ccouldn\u2019t service XL Connect much longer,\u201d says Smith. They liked that XL Connect leveraged their existing Excel skills, but they wanted something that was more user friendly and intuitive. As they looked for a new solution, Smith recalls that the team saw Spreadsheet Server mentioned in one of Epicor\u2019s newsletters and decided it could be right for them.\nBuilding to Success with Spreadsheet Server and Epicor \nCaymas Boats was able to join an early adopter program to implement Spreadsheet Server from insightsoftware, being among the first cloud customers to use the product. Within \u201cjust one training session\u201d with Spreadsheet Server, Smith was able to \u201cconvert all his reports over from XL Connect\u201d and could see value within a couple of days of implementation.\nSmith notes that the support teams were \u201cflawless\u201d and \u201chave been incredibly supportive\u201d. The process was \u201cone of the best-run implementations (Smith) has ever seen,\u201d with \u201cfantastic\u201d training tools and tips sheets provided alongside the training session. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing for someone who is uneducated on the product,\u201d says Smith.\nSpreadsheet Server extends the reporting capabilities the Caymas Boats\u2019 team enjoys with Epicor ERP, allowing them to \u201cget more out of Epicor, faster,\u201d thanks to improved performance in Excel and the accessible nature of the reporting solution. Smith says that because Spreadsheet Server is a more user serviceable reporting tool, \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to find and add accounts into the GL.\u201d\nSmith purports that the increased convenience and ease of use Spreadsheet Server provides his team translates to greater efficiency and, ultimately, time savings. Caymas Boats has also not only reduced their average monthly reporting time by about an hour, but Smith also says that Spreadsheet Server can save them up to fifteen hours when adding in a new GL account.\nSmith is better able to see the new things happening in the business, without waiting or needing to be briefed by everyone involved, as Spreadsheet Server not only \u201ctells us if the statements don\u2019t balance,\u201d but also helps direct him to where the change has occurred. Smith describes looking for changes in financial statements prior to Spreadsheet Server as \u201clooking for a needle in a pile of needles.\u201d\nAdditionally, Smith notes that the monetary savings from having a truly self-service reporting tool are readily apparent as \u201cconsultants are expensive, and don\u2019t know about our system.\u201d With Spreadsheet Server, Smith\u2019s team has been able to easily recreate and distribute the reports to senior management, keeping them in \u201cthe format our management team likes.\u201d\nNow that they have completed the program, Smith is \u201clooking forward to wrapping up testing and fully rolling out Spreadsheet Server.\u201d\nNavigating Success \nCaymas Boats has seen a number of improvements as a result of implementing Spreadsheet Server, including:\n\nTime savings of up to 15 hours: Get more out of Epicor, faster\n\u201cFantastic user serviceability\u201d: Easy for the team to get up and running and realize value\nFast analysis with sophisticated drill-down: \u201cMuch faster to find and add accounts into the GL\u201d\n\n"

        "content": "\n\nInvestor AB, founded by the Wallenberg family in 1916, and based in Stockholm, Sweden, is an investor in high-quality, global companies, including AstraZeneca, Atlas Copco, and Electrolux. Taking a long-term investment perspective, it applies its industrial experience, network, and financial strength to help its portfolio companies outperform competition and reach their full potential.\nThe Challenge\nContinuous improvement is in the DNA of the finance team at Investor AB. Prior to implementing Certent CDM, it already had an effective process to prepare and publish its interim report. However, as this process consumed significant resources at a critical part of the closing process, and considering the amount of manual effort required to create both Swedish and English versions of the report and cross check the numbers in both, the team saw an opportunity to make its process more efficient.\nHistorically, creating the interim report took the team of five people around a day and a half, which limited its bandwidth to really dig into the numbers and draw conclusions to help inform the Investor management and board.\nWhen inevitable last-minute changes were requested, this required the team to perform extensive validation to ensure the data and narrative in their reports were correct and consistent. This often led to the team working late hours under the critical time pressure of its close deadline. Anders Eckerwall, Head of Finance at Investor AB, recalls that this manual process meant that \u201cit was risky to make operational changes at the last minute.\u201d Any changes would have to be applied to both versions of the report and cross-checked, taking valuable time away from analysis and commentary.\nSo, while the team was able to complete the interim close process on time, Jenny Rydingstam, Director, Group Consolidation at Investor AB, notes that Investor AB is \u201calways looking for improvement and for ways to do things better.\u201d Automation was the logical next step in improving its process, so the team found Certent CDM from insightsoftware.\nBuilding to Success with Certent CDM\nWorking with insightsoftware partner, Addedo, a specialist Swedish consulting firm focused on consolidated accounting and regulatory reporting, Investor AB felt that its implementation of Certent CDM was extremely smooth and quick.\nRydingstam recalls that Addedo walked her whole team through the system to familiarize themselves with how it worked. Even though the team received its training from Addedo remotely, because the implementation took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, she felt that the meetings were still very hands-on. Rydingstam explains that the smooth transition was aided by her whole team being \u201cso involved with building the templates and structure\u201d during those training sessions, noting that \u201cAddedo provided great support and helped us deliver a successful project.\u201d\nAnother contributing factor to the rapid onboarding was the fact that Certent CDM uses Microsoft Office as part of the user interface, providing the team with a familiar environment that was easy to pick up. As a result, it took less than one month to implement Certent CDM, meaning the team was able to use it to create their interim reporting during their Q3, 2020 close.\nEckerwall has found that since implementing Certent CDM, the team has \u201cmore breathing space to work out the story behind the numbers,\u201d which perfectly aligns with its strategy of making continuous improvements. By automating recurring, multi-author reports with Certent CDM and being able to use the tool anywhere it wants to combine words and numbers for publication, the Investor AB team is able to free-up more resources to focus on drawing valuable insights and analysis from their reporting during the critical close period.\nThe process itself is much less manual and Rydingstam is happy to \u201chave all the data in one place,\u201d as this \u201cmakes it much smoother to manage, as we just need to upload one file into the Cloud.\u201d This reduces the time the team needs to spend cross-checking numbers, allowing them to make any last-minute changes stress-free, and giving them more time to analyze the data.\nIn the future, the team is considering using Certent CDM to combine data loading of legal figures from the group consolidation system alongside operational figures from the BI platform and will be evaluating this later this year. The team eventually sees itself using Certent CDM also for monthly management reporting as well as for interim and other text intensive recurring reports.\nSince implementation, the team has seen the continuous improvement it was hoping for, with Eckerwall noting that Certent CDM helped elevate the team to a \u201cmodern finance function.\u201d It has since recommended Certent CDM at its accounting and CFO days.\nNavigating Success\nInvestor AB has already made many improvements to their interim close process as a result of implementing Certent CDM, including:\n\nAutomating the interim report means it now takes around an hour to complete, compared to the day and a half it took with its previous manual process.\nIt now has \u201cextra time to look into the figures and provide conclusions to management\u201d (Rydingstam).\nHaving the data all in one place gives it a single version of truth, ensuring consistency within the report and across the Swedish and English versions.\n\u201cLate changes are much easier to handle now than they were before\u201d (Eckerwall).\n\n"

Established in 1970, Worldwide Facilities is ranked the fifth largest property/casualty wholesaler on Business Insurance\u2019s 2020 Data and Ranking List.\nThe Challenge\nWorldwide Facilities went live on the Oracle ERP Cloud in March 2020. Their finance team used a mix of standard and custom Financial Reporting Studio (FRS) reports alongside the Essbase Spreadsheet Add-In for ad hoc inquires and drill downs against the Oracle ERP Cloud GL Balances cube.\nAlthough the finance team was pretty satisfied with FRS, they still felt the reports weren\u2019t as flexible as they would like, nor were they intuitive enough to justify rolling out to the wider team. They were less happy with the Essbase Spreadsheet Add-In, because they felt the drill-through feature didn\u2019t work consistently to show the details of their balances.\nSo, after living with this approach for five to six months, they decided they needed a better solution.\nGavin Humason, Assistant Controller at Worldwide Facilities, explained that \u201cusing the built-in tools from Oracle just didn\u2019t seem to give us the same functionality that we were used to.\u201d Humason had been working with an insightsoftware solution at his previous company, while using the on-premise Oracle E-Business Suite, so he knew that there were better tools out there for finance that would offer more functionality.\nHis team chose to implement insightsoftware, as they knew that this would give finance the self-service reporting solution they needed to create repeatable reports with built-in drill downs, over near real-time data. They also knew that the tool would be easy to deploy to other people on the team, thanks to its intuitive and familiar Excel interface.\nBuilding to Success with insightsoftware\nAlthough Worldwide Facilities\u2019 implementation of insightsoftware\u2019s reporting solution is still in its early days (around a month since implementation), the team has been using it to support ad hoc inquiries for variance analysis and account reconciliation, and they have already noticed significant time savings and improvements to their reporting process.\nHumason explained that prior to implementing insightsoftware, it was a challenge for Worldwide Facilities to run inquiries across a range of accounts. Now insightsoftware\u2019s solutions make it much easier to look at financial statement line items and drill into the details faster than their previous P&L reports.\nFor Humason, \u201cbeing able to jump from the General Ledger down to a subledger makes it much easier to investigate variances.\u201d Humason identified that, \u201cwith insightsoftware, it\u2019s fast and simple to navigate to the actual invoice number that you want to see.\u201d Where further analysis is required, Humason noted that \u201cinsightsoftware allows us to access our data in a format that can easily be put into a pivot table,\u201d joking that \u201cin finance, anything can be resolved with a good pivot table.\u201d\nAnother benefit the finance team has seen from implementing insightsoftware alongside Oracle ERP Cloud is that it\u2019s much faster to retrieve account details. For example, it took Humason less than 30 seconds to retrieve account details using insightsoftware, compared to several minutes using the native reporting tools (depending on the number of activities in an account). These time-savings soon add up into some considerable productivity gains when you are analyzing all expenses for a month, for example.\nIt is also much easier to manage the Excel-based reports that finance teams love. Previously, when using Essbase, Humason recalls that when updating the hierarchy within a report, \u201cit\u2019s almost like you have to recreate the report from scratch.\u201d Now, Humason stated that insightsoftware is \u201cmuch more dynamic in the way it brings in the latest version of our account hierarchy.\u201d Again, this saves time and removes the need for specialist knowledge to maintain reports.\nNavigating Success\nSince implementing insightsoftware, Worldwide Facilities has benefitted from productivity gains and more flexible reports that meet the needs of their business. These benefits include:\n\nFewer delays with the ability to retrieve account information in under 30 seconds, compared to several minutes using native reporting tools.\nFaster variance analysis and account reconciliations with integrated drill downs from balances right down to subledger transactions in Excel.\nMore flexible data presentation and filters that are built with finance in mind: Data are presented in a format that finance teams love and is easily adapted into pivot tables.\nCustomizable reports: It\u2019s easy for finance to create and manage reports, which saves time and allows them to respond quickly to changing business needs.\n\nLooking to the future, Humason and his team are looking to do much more with insightsoftware. They are currently looking to create custom, repeatable reports in Excel that automatically roll forward to the next period, which will drive further time savings and free-up more of his team\u2019s time to focus on value-added analysis.\nWith the benefits they have seen already, Humason wishes he\u2019d implemented insightsoftware sooner to help with the \u201cthroes of year-end.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nWeCare Holding is a group of privately held health care centers in Denmark, offering a range of services to more than 80,000 inhabitants across 30 different locations in the country.\nThe Challenge\nIn 2018, WeCare Holding acquired three companies comprising more than 20 health care centers across Denmark, as well as a staffing business. With thousands of patients served each year, the data volumes generated by the combined health care centers was enormous. The existing IT infrastructure for reporting was complex and fragmented, making it hard to access data efficiently.\nLars Poulsen, CFO at WeCare Holding, quickly realized that it would be impossible to work effectively without a dedicated reporting and data management tool. \u201cIt\u2019s uncommon to use BI tools in the health care industry\u201d, said Poulsen. However, having worked with various BI tool over the years, he knew that it could make all the difference.\nAs WeCare started integrating the new businesses, they revisited their IT infrastructure and decided to implement Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central as their new ERP system. About six months later, they went to look for a BI and reporting solution that could handle and capture their vast amounts of data and simplify reporting across the group.\nAs WeCare looked at the market to identify suitable options, they struggled to find a well-balanced solution that could cater to all their needs. Some solutions were too large, complex and expensive, while others were not powerful enough to extract and process their large data volumes. WeCare needed a system that could handle their multiple data sources while delivering effective and intuitive analytics, and that could be implemented rapidly.\nPoulsen had used Jet Reports and Jet Analytics in a previous position and knew that it would be a good fit. \u201cI have multiple sources I\u2019d like to extract data from, and therefore I knew that the Jet products would be the right solution for us. It\u2019s easy to work with, and very agile, which is important to us.\u201d\nBuilding to Success with Jet Reports and Jet Analytics \nToday, WeCare uses Jet Analytics to combine data from its multiple source systems into a single source of truth. This data is accessed using Jet Reports with Excel as a front-end interface, across the entire group. Implementation was fast, with the first reports ready-to-use within less than a month. The smooth implementation was delivered in collaboration with Jet partner Atlytix. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some very good consultants from Atlytix help us implement the solution. We started using Jet Reports with their help one year ago, and we are so much better today\u201d, said Poulsen.\n\u201cWe started extracting data from Dynamics 365 Business Central, and the setup went very fast. Within the primary care unit, we have a different data source, which we integrated as a second step. Now we can extract invoicing data from the journal system, which we use to measure how well our business is performing. That was also easy to setup. The way we look at data is something that\u2019s quite new within the health care market\u201d, said Poulsen. \u201cThis data-driven behavior creates a more consistent approach to analysis and decision-making, which is an essential foundation for delivering quality in the primary health sector.\u201d\nUser adoption has exceeded all expectations, thanks to the intuitive interface and user-friendly self-service reporting. \u201cA challenge for us has been that the users, the health care center managers, don\u2019t have a finance background. That\u2019s why we chose Excel as front-end, because it\u2019s intuitive and easy to learn. Our managers are very enthusiastic about the solution. They can extract reports at any time and compare with other centers, which is very powerful for them, and it creates transparency between centers\u201d, said Poulsen.\nToday, Jet Reports is used by about 30 users across the group:\n\n10 users in back-office, including Senior Management and the Office of the CFO\n20-25 health care center managers\n\nJet is not only used to manage multiple data sources, but also for creating financial and operational reports:\n\nFinancial reporting for the Office of the CFO and management, e.g., extracting invoicing data from the journal system, salary system, etc. to create various financial reports.\nOperational reporting, looking at incoming phone calls statistics, e.g., phone cues. The organization also looks at the correlation between incoming calls and issued invoices.\nHR reporting, e.g., to see how well the organization onboards new hires, as well as measuring the employee retention rate.\n\nAs the company continues to grow, it continues to invest in new IT systems, that need to be integrated into the overall group data ecosystem: \u201cWe invest a lot in IT systems that can support our business. With Jet, it\u2019s easy to integrate the data from the new systems into our reporting process, which is really helpful\u201d, said Poulsen.\nFurthermore, Poulsen appreciates the reliable security and data access management provided by Jet: \u201cThe IT security is very strong. I can set up distribution groups via the active directory, allowing people only within a specific region to have access to a given report.\u201d\nNavigating Success\nHaving gone from weeks to seconds in extracting reports, WeCare could not be more satisfied with their solution. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t been able to extract the same volume of numbers with our previous setup. We can really crunch big numbers within a matter of seconds now, before it would take weeks. It\u2019s a completely new tool we are working with. We\u2019re ten levels better today!\u201d, said Poulsen.\n\nWe Care has seen several positive results of implementing Jet, including:\nEffective collection of numerous data sources in one place, for one single source of truth that the entire organization can report over\nEnabling health care managers to extract reports at a local level and take subsequent actions\nDramatically reduced time spent on report creation, going from weeks to seconds, with refreshable reports in Excel\nCross-functional usage across Finance, Management, HR and Operations from a single, shared view\nRapid implementation in less than a month\n\n\u201cI wish more people would look into this tool, because it\u2019s so powerful\u201d, Poulsen concluded.\n"

        "company": "AAC",
        "content": "\n\nAmerican Asset Corporation (AAC) is a real estate company based in North Carolina. Established in 1986, it has been involved in over 8 million square feet of real estate projects, including developing over 6 million square feet. They currently hold a portfolio of over 6 million feet of space, including retail, offices, and technology warehouses.\nThe Challenge\nWhen Nick Stuart joined AAC as Corporate Controller a few months before the company implemented Spreadsheet Server, he was looking for ways to automate financial information. Coming from PricewaterhouseCoopers, Stuart had a background in data management and knew the value of being able to automate reporting.\nStuart\u2019s team had to generate monthly and quarterly reports, not only internally, but also for their lenders and investors. They used the native tools that came with their Yardi Voyager ERP system, but found these manually intensive, time consuming, and inconsistent. Data weren\u2019t readily available, and you\u2019d often have to wait up to 45 days to get them.\nHis team had a deadline to complete and dispatch external reports within 30 days, and Stuart recalled the team using every one of those days, often sending the reports out on the final day. \u201cThis meant we were constantly looking back, not forward,\u201d remembers Stuart, \u201cwhich was one of the things that we had to change.\u201d This retrospective outlook meant they rarely had time to plan for future endeavors or get ahead of their competitors. Additionally, team morale was low, as so much time was needed to generate reports and \u201cfight deadlines\u201d that they were working long and unsociable hours.\n\u201cWhat I was really looking for,\u201d said Stuart, \u201cwas how can I have real-time data?\u201d Lack of real-time visibility into their cash flow was holding AAC back from progressing as a business, as it was difficult to know exactly where their cash was at any given point. \u201cWe\u2019d only know our cash position for the entire portfolio at the end of the month.\u201d\nBuilding to Success with Spreadsheet Server\nAAC decided to go with Spreadsheet Server after looking for a product that could speed up and automate their report generation process while providing access to their data in real time. As insightsoftware is a company local to AAC, also based in North Carolina, it made the choice even clearer for Stuart.\nAfter implementation, Stuart\u2019s team was able to use Spreadsheet Server to quickly build a financial statement workbook to support each of their lenders. Stuart\u2019s team found that the time spent on creating new reports is focused more on formatting to create the desired presentation, rather than on sourcing and manipulating the data. \u201cBuilding the formulas and populating from there is the quickest part,\u201d said Stuart.\nOnce created, the workbooks are so easy to use that Stuart points out that \u201cone of our property accountants can go in and update the information themselves, and it will auto-populate everything.\u201d That is because, rather than having to generate new reports every monthly or quarterly reporting cycle, teams can just open the existing report, choose the property and the time period they want to display, and the report will automatically populate in seconds. This cut what was once a 30-day reporting process down to just 3 days. \u201cHaving these new reports ready in August meant we really felt the benefit in September, and it\u2019s just got more efficient each month since,\u201d said Stuart. \u201cTeam morale has gone through the roof since implementing Spreadsheet Server,\u201d as his finance team were now able to free up more of their time for focus on high-value projects.\nOne of the next areas Stuart turned his team\u2019s attention to was creating a global cash view. With a direct connection into Yardi, Spreadsheet Server gave AAC the ability to view their cash position \u201calmost up to the day.\u201d With this level of visibility, it has helped AAC to start work on developments sooner, as they know exactly \u201dwhere their cash is on any given day, within each account as well as the total cash number.\u201d\nAnother application of Spreadsheet Server has helped AAC close retail lease agreements quicker. By enabling their property teams to access data on mobile or tablet devices while they are out on location, they can provide any prospect with the potential sales per square foot of the unit they are looking at, using real-time data. This offers a real advantage over their competitors, many of whom do not have this level of insight into their properties so readily available.\nHaving already accomplished so much in just four months after implementation, Stuart and his team are now looking to their future with Spreadsheet Server and for other ways that it can help grow their business. Stuart notes that \u201cthere are a whole host of processes drafted up, with Spreadsheet Server as the foundation.\u201d One process they\u2019re hoping to implement soon is to provide their tenants with an up-to-date view of their shared-services use. Previously, tenants were provided with an estimate of monthly costs based on historic data, but soon they will be provided with a regular, up-to-date view of their use based on actual data. This will prevent situations in which the annual estimates were incorrect, and will avoid either tenants having to pay an additional bill at the end of the year, or the landlord having to issue a credit note.\nNavigating Success with Spreadsheet Server\nBy automating reporting from Yardi Voyager, AAC has realized impressive time savings, and its finance team are using the time saved wisely, exploiting their data to deliver tangible business benefits. They are now able to plan for the future as a result of implementing Spreadsheet Server, including:\n\nReduced time taken to generate reports by 90% \u2013 reports that once took 30 days to create now take just 3\nInfluenced investment decisions using real-time visibility into their cash position to release funds for new developments earlier\nClosed lease agreements faster by providing prospective tenants with accurate, up-to-date information on potential sales per square foot\n\u201cChanged the mindset of reporting\u201d \u2013 reports are now proactive, whereas they used to be reactive\n\n"

LINX offers reliable exchange of Internet traffic with increased routing control and better performance. LINX is a not-for-profit organization, which means that they invest their service and membership fees into strengthening all their network services. \nThe Challenge\nPrior to implementing Bizview, LINX largely relied on homemade Excel spreadsheets for budgeting, planning, and reporting. Besides taking up a lot of valuable time, the use of spreadsheets for planning and reporting generated critical errors, largely due to the confusion of numerous spreadsheets being sent back forth. Furthermore, the process was difficult to follow-up, making the organization reliant on email communication to send out forms and gather figures. The finance team would spend a lot of time consolidating figures into one cohesive budget document. Furthermore, it was hard to get the right data out, and to combine data, in reports.\nKurt Erik Lindqvist, CEO at LINX, had used Bizview in his previous position in another company. Now, faced with a cumbersome budgeting process at LINX, he knew that Bizview would be the right solution to address their budgeting challenges. \nBuilding to Success with Bizview\nLINX selected Bizview as a planning tool. They initially integrated Bizview with Sage but later switched to Xero\u2019s cloud-based accounting software. Bizview offered direct integrations to both systems. \u201cWe have integrated Bizview with all our internal systems, and we\u2019re very satisfied,\u201d said Kurt Erik Lindqvist, CEO LINX. \nThey experienced a smooth implementation. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with the same product experts during all the years we\u2019ve had Bizview and we know them well. The implementation has been successful and stable,\u201d said Lindqvist. \nDuring the first phase, they used Bizview for budgeting. They have now expanded the use of Bizview to financial reporting as well as introducing rolling two- and five-year forecasts as part of a continuous planning process. They have also started using Bizview for dashboards and KPI analysis, including both financial and non-financial data. Dashboards help them present key figures to their customers and partners in an effective and compelling way. \u201cTo be able to present data from various systems and to cross-reference figures in the same graph, was a bonus that we didn\u2019t expect to benefit from. We\u2019ve used that feature more than planned,\u201d said Lindqvist. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to build dashboards in Bizview.\u201d \nBeing a not-for-profit organization, they face the challenge of balancing their income and expenditure to reach their zero target, so as not to generate too much profit. They use Bizview to model scenarios in which they lower unit prices to various levels and then forecast for how long they can sustain these pricing reductions. They have greater trust in their forecasts and models now, which was not always the case prior to Bizview. \u201cWe used to have a lot of errors in our Excel spreadsheets,\u201d said Lindqvist. \u201cWith Bizview it\u2019s a lot easier and our forecasts are more accurate.\u201d \nWith Bizview, LINX has been able to enjoy fewer errors, spend less time on manual budgeting tasks, and discover a whole new world of possibilities within reporting, forecasting, and dashboards. \u201cUsing Bizview has opened up a host of new ideas on what we should do,\u201d said Lindqvist. \u201cNow we just need to find the time to implement them!\u201d \n"

Today, The Carlsberg Brewery Guangdong in Huizhou supplies products to mainland China, Hong Kong, and the Macau markets. Carlsberg offers 20 different brews from 25 breweries in China, catering to consumers on various drinking occasions.\nThe Challenge \nTo produce their financial and management reports, the finance team at Carlsberg China needed to combine data from more than eight Microsoft Dynamics NAV databases. Because of the data volumes and number of databases involved, end users found it hard to navigate their NAV systems to find the data they needed.\nThis meant the finance team was forced to export data from each NAV system and manually stitch them together in Excel to generate the reports they needed. This process consumed a lot of time and manual effort and had to be repeated from scratch, each month.\nThe team at Carlsberg recognized that they needed a solution that could consolidate data from multiple companies and databases into a single data warehouse, without requiring a lengthy implementation process, or relying on technical specialists. The chosen solution would also need to cope with their data volumes and still provide fast query response times for their more than 300 end users.\nFacing these challenges, they chose to deploy Jet Analytics and Jet Reports.\nBuilding to Success with Jet \nUsing Jet Analytics, Carlsberg China was able to work with pre-built content to quickly create a data warehouse. Jet Analytics also provided multiple cubes to support the team\u2019s different analysis needs while delivering sub-second query response times.\nUsing Jet Reports, finance team members were able to leverage their existing Excel skills to quickly and easily create the reports they needed, saving time and eliminating the need to dump data from NAV into static spreadsheets.\nBy implementing Jet Analytics and Jet Reports across the organization, Carlsberg China has seen many positive results:\n\nThe team has already shaved one day off their month-end reporting process\nPreviously, users were not able to generate reports, but now they are self-sufficient, because they can easily build the reports they need, without requiring technical expertise, by using Jet Reports against the data warehouse\nThey can now easily and instantly run comparative reports across different date ranges using a simple pivot-style drag-and-drop table from OLAP Cubes. Previously, getting this level of visibility took weeks for them to produce manually.\n\nNavigating Success\nWith simplified navigation of data and reduced dependency on the IT department to create reports, the finance team can now create the reports they need, at any time.\n\u201cWe now have a reliable and timely data source providing a single version of the truth for our financial reporting. Users can easily build reports by themselves to support their analysis,\u201d said Chen Johnson, BI Engineer at Carlsberg China. \u201cWe can also now view our data at an aggregate level instead of just viewing a detailed listing, which makes it faster and easier for users to navigate their financial data to make informed decisions.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nCalifornia-based BSK Associates has been in business for over 54 years, providing consulting engineering and analytical testing for its customers, operating out of seven locations across the West Coast.\nThe Challenge\nBSK Associates is split into two divisions, each using a separate ERP system. One division uses Deltek Vision SaaS (on the cloud) and the other an on-premise ERP based on an on-premise, Microsoft SQL Server database. \nBSK was using a mix of Crystal Reports and Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to provide information to stakeholders. However, BSK found SSRS to be a complex, technical reporting product that required the use of external consultants every time a new report was required. Since this was an additional cost and had to be scheduled, it meant stakeholders were waiting for a long time before being able to conduct their analysis. Within the business, there was also a lack of trust in the data produced by Crystal Reports and SSRS, because it was not clear that data was being pulled from the right tables. Because BSK had to merge the two ERPs, and Accounting needed to see the numbers, Accounting found themselves consistently using their preferred tool of Microsoft Excel to manually merge and review BSK financial data.\nAround two years ago, BSK moved to Deltek Vision on the cloud, which meant the Accounting team at BSK had to evaluate alternative means of generating reports. Since IT was now in charge of report generation, this meant that the CIO, Kris Morton, and his employees in IT were having to put a lot of time into helping the Accounting department generate reports. Morton recalls \u201csome of the IT staff didn\u2019t have the deep financial knowledge that would be required for these reports, so there ended up being a lot of guessing.\u201d This guessing could led to errors in the reports, and with every error that occurred, more time would have to be spent by both departments fixing the issue and re-running reports.\nPrior to using Spreadsheet Server, it would take Accountants hours each month to generate reports, which often involved manually rekeying data. This was especially true when combining data from both Deltek Vision and their SQL Server-based ERP into one report, for which they ended up manually dumping the data into Excel. These manual data dumps increased the potential for error, and also took significant time away from the actual analysis of the reports they were attempting to generate.\nBuilding to Success with Spreadsheet Server\nSpreadsheet Server has the advantage of being based on the Accountant\u2019s tool of choice: Excel. This meant that the team at BSK had a short learning curve after implementing the product. No one had to learn how to code, and with Excel being \u201cnative\u201d to most Accountants, it was easy for IT to hand over responsibility to them. The fact that Spreadsheet Server could connect to multiple data sources was an immediate win for BSK, and was what ultimately made Morton think \u201cthis is the solution we need.\u201d\nThe move over to Spreadsheet Server saw immediate benefits for BSK, with Morton noting that the product had \u201ctaken a lot of work away from IT staff,\u201d and it was \u201cnice to watch Accounting take over.\u201d The ability to switch over this responsibility saved both Accounting and IT departments so much time because \u201cAccounting knows what they want, and doesn\u2019t have to explain every report to IT.\u201d\n\u201cSpreadsheet Server solved some of our biggest data challenges by simplifying the reporting process and bringing everything together in one place,\u201d added Morton. \u201cOur stakeholders now have full confidence in the data they are using, as they now have one source of truth.\u201d\nBSK began using Spreadsheet Server during the COVID-19 pandemic, insightsoftware was able to provide \u201ctop notch\u201d virtual training, answering any questions that arose during the adoption process. Morton mentions that, without this training \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be where we were as a company.\u201d\nIn addition to this, Spreadsheet Server allowed BSK Accountants to shave time off their report generation almost immediately. Report automation meant that they didn\u2019t have to spend hours creating reports, and the platform allowed them to \u201cborrow\u201d from other reports, rather than having to recreate them.\nFor example:\n\nOne report that used to be keyed manually for 5 cost centers, which took 20 minutes to recreate in Spreadsheet Server, can now be refreshed instantly with the latest data available, at any time\nTheir Laboratory Supplies Report had to be produced weekly and was also keyed manually as it pulled data from both ERP systems. This report is now automated and requires no intervention from end-users\n\nNavigating Success\nBSK has seen substantial time savings and increased trust in data as a result of implementing Spreadsheet Server. Some reasons for this are:\n\nReports that once took hours to generate at the end of each period are now completely automated\n\u201cCut out the middle man\u201d \u2013 Handing responsibility over to power users has reduced the time spent by IT generating reports\nStaff now have access to live data across multiple data sources, and can be assured that their reports are up to date with accurate figures\nEveryone was already copying data into Excel, but it was static data; Spreadsheet Server provides access to live data in Excel, which eliminates data dumping and manual manipulation, and means fewer errors as a result\n\n"

Once Gauthier learned about Certent DisclosureNet and discovered she could do this (and more) within one fast, simple to use solution, she quickly replaced her former, exhaustive processes. Now, Certent DisclosureNet has become a crucial part of Gauthier\u2019s daily routine and has helped reduce her time spent researching by ~70% when compared with her former methods.\nSituation\nThe filings Gauthier typically translates or reviews are offering documents such as prospectuses and takeover bids, or continuous disclosure documents including annual information forms and proxy circulars. Before Certent DisclosureNet, Gauthier used a combination of Internet search engines and regulatory websites to find these documents.\nWhile this process worked, it was time-consuming and often frustrating for Gauthier because if she did find the documents she was looking for, she couldn\u2019t always determine right away whether they were bilingual or existed only in English. But at the time, this had proven to be the most effective method for conducting this particular type of research.\nThen Gauthier learned about Certent DisclosureNet and her workflow changed for the better.\nTransformation\nAfter the firm got Certent DisclosureNet access, it didn\u2019t take long for Gauthier and her team to identify the product as an extremely useful translation aid. She explains that it\u2019s especially helpful when she finds a precedent French document to use for a new translation. This means that the project will consist mostly of an intensive review rather than a complete translation.\nAfter discovering its uses and benefits, Certent DisclosureNet quickly replaced Gauthier\u2019s former research process and became an integral part of her workflow. \u201cI use Certent DisclosureNet almost every day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s become part of my routine; in the morning I get a coffee, open my computer and log in to Certent DisclosureNet.\u201d\nGauthier counts the various search criteria as her favorite Certent DisclosureNet features. In particular, she regularly uses the English/French match feature, which brings up versions of documents in both languages. Gauthier also finds the company name filter especially helpful to find documents from a specific company, reducing the time she spends scouring the Internet for the same information.\nThe Results\nGauthier credits Certent DisclosureNet with giving her team \u201cthe great advantage of being able to find the documents we\u2019re looking for in English and in French easily and very rapidly, which makes us far more efficient when we translate or review.\u201d\nUsing Certent DisclosureNet on a daily basis has transformed Gauthier\u2019s workflow and has helped produce the following results:\n\nTime spent researching has been reduced by ~70% compared to previous research methods\nReducing the time spent finding documents for translation or review in turn saves clients significant time in getting the final translation\nUsing Certent DisclosureNet among the translation team has improved efficiency for the firm overall, creating more streamlined workflow processes and delivering heightened service to clients\n\nSince learning about Certent DisclsoureNet five years ago, Marie-Eve Gauthier can confidently say that the Lavery, de Billy, L.L.P. translation team\u2019s efficiency has improved. Rather than combining various forms of Internet searches to find the right documents, Gauthier automatically turns to Certent DisclosureNet as a one-stop shop for her needs. As a result, it\u2019s become a part of her daily routine and helps deliver better service to the firm\u2019s clients.\nWith Certent DisclosureNet, Gauthier\u2019s research is never lost in translation.\n"

As a leading North American energy infrastructure company with focus in Canada and the U.S., AltaGas operates three divisions: power, gas and utilities. Last year was noteworthy for von Engelbrechten\u2019s Power Division, as it made several significant acquisitions. During this busy time when efficient disclosure research was integral, von Engelbrechten was introduced to Certent DisclosureNet \u2013 and its client success team \u2013 to help ensure Power Division disclosure in each AltaGas disclosure filing was compliant.\nSituation\nWhen von Engelbrechten came on board at AltaGas, the company was midway through a series of significant power transactions. These included the acquisition of a biomass electricity generation company, construction of a wind power generation facility in which AltaGas has 50% ownership, and most recently the acquisition of Blythe Energy, LLC (which owns a natural gas fired electricity generation facility.)\nFrom von Engelbrechten\u2019s perspective, these deals represented not just major wins for the company, but also an influx of information to publicly disclose. To help ensure AltaGas produced filings that were compliant with respect to Power Division disclosure, von Engelbrechten needed to review comparable disclosures from peer companies.\nHis colleagues recommended Certent DisclosureNet for this research, and while von Engelbrechten could see its potential as a powerful tool, he felt like he was searching for some tiny needles in a large haystack. As a new user, he knew he needed some guidance, so he picked up the phone and called the insightsoftware support line.\nTransformation\nOnce von Engelbrechten completed one hour of training with his insightsoftware client success specialist, he was on his way to becoming a more effective researcher. During this initial session, von Engelbrechten not only learned how to successfully use some of his favorite features like automatic alerts and the document compare function, but he felt it was \u201cgreat to put a face to the product, and know that [he could] count on [the team] to help.\u201d\nWhile he has encountered minor obstacles commonly faced in researching, von Engelbrechten notes that it\u2019s been \u201cnothing that the client success team hasn\u2019t helped me fix. The online training and support provided by insightsoftware is excellent!\u201d\nToday, von Engelbrechten understands the product\u2019s capabilities and consistently finds what he\u2019s looking for in Certent DisclosureNet, ultimately helping him generate compliant Power Division disclosures for AltaGas.\nThe Results\nWith the initial and ongoing support from the client success team, von Engelbrechten has increased his research proficiency by learning how to maximize the capabilities in Certent DisclosureNet.\n\nResearch productivity increased by 33% with respect to searching for comparable disclosures\nFinds what he\u2019s looking for in Certent DisclosureNet 75% of the time\nComfort in knowing the client success team is available for support when required\nNow equipped with the skills to research for future projects\n\nDuring an exciting year for the Power Division of AltaGas, Eric von Engelbrechten faced the responsibility of ensuring the Power Division disclosed the necessary information. Thrilled that the company had a solution for this type of research, von Engelbrechten turned to the insightsoftware client success team for training. The skills he\u2019s learned have increased his research efficiency and help ensure AltaGas\u2019 Power Division disclosures meet regulatory requirements.\nThat\u2019s the power of Certent DisclosureNet.\n"

The transfer of data between sources was complex; manual efforts were needed to keep the numbers accurate; there was scarcely any audit trail available, and amendments to accounting policies sometimes resulted in consistency problems.\nThe Solution\nLV= set out to find a solution that would improve controls, and to get one version of the truth, cutting out many stages of their manual processes.\nThe Benefit\nCDM significantly reduced the time spent producing recurring internal and external reports, increased controls around the process, gained a vote of confidence with auditors, and reduced overall risk.\nThe Situation\nA combination of rapid growth and a desire to stay ahead of the rapidly changing regulatory environment had a profound impact on the Group Finance department at LV=. The team commissioned an extensive report from Ernst & Young to review the financial environment and identify areas for improvement. Year-end reporting, reports to the Board of Directors, and the efficiency of the interfaces between financial systems were investigated. The review encompassed more than 30 subsidiary finance departments at LV=, including the Corporate Group Finance department \u2014 and the results were a mixed-bag\n\u201cOn the plus side, we were found to be \u2018error-free\u2019 in our reporting but there were concerns about the control the department had over the numbers with our manual processes for gathering and creating reports, as well as over-exposure to numerous and complex spreadsheets,\u201d said Andy Young, Head of Finance at LV=. \u201cSo, we hopped right on it, setting up a working party to review the Ernst & Young report and identify where we could improve our controls \u2014 and therefore our efficiencies \u2014 and mitigate our risks in the process.\u201d\nThe finance team at LV= determined that they had good control over the policy and source systems, the interface to the general ledger, and the ledger itself. In general, it was a well-controlled process until the team had to report out from the general ledger. Not surprisingly to Young, control became more difficult to maintain when multiple Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word files came into play, along with the transformation of a consolidated spreadsheet into Adobe InDesign to produce the \u2018glossy\u2019 accounts. \u201cOur subsidiary Statutory Accounts were prepared in Word and were produced from Excel files from our trial balances. These Word documents were rekeyed into our consolidated spreadsheet. That got us our subsidiary information, with a fair amount of pain, and then that consolidated spreadsheet had to be put into a Group Accounts template, which was then copied into a desktop application \u2014 Adobe InDesign \u2014 to produce our reports for filing,\u201d said Young.\nThe process left the company exposed to significant risk. The transfer of data between sources was complex; manual efforts were needed to keep the numbers accurate; there was scarcely any audit trail available, and amendments to accounting policies and notes which occurred at the subsidiary level sometimes resulted in consistency problems.\n\u201cBut the biggest single issue was changes coming from the subsidiaries \u2014 from the bottom up \u2014 at the ninth-hour, always a critical time, when we had to get the reports done and filed, limiting our review and checking time, which in turn put pressure on us not to miss key changes to the information,\u201d said Young. \u201cIn effect, it was the \u2018last mile\u2019 in producing reports that was exposing us.\u201d\nThe Transformation\nLV= set out to find a solution that would improve controls and, according to Young,\u201c\u2026get away from the onus on our highly qualified financial staff to be production experts and free up their time to add true-value in accordance with their training and expertise to our operations.\u201d\nLV= found very little on the market that fit the bill, until discovering Certent CDM. \u201cWe saw a few supposed competitive products but from what we could tell, they really didn\u2019t compete against CDM. We weren\u2019t aware of any other solution on the market that did what CDM does,\u201d said Young.\n\u201cSimply put, CDM gives us one version of the truth. Since CDM pulls straight from our trial balances, rather than pushing data through Microsoft Excel, we have that assurance that key data is coming straight from our General Ledger. The old, laborious and error fraught method was to pull information into multiple spreadsheets, move it about in these spreadsheets, and then into Microsoft Word to produce the accounts. CDM cuts out many stages of reprocessing information that characterized our mainly manual, past processes,\u201d confirmed Young.\nMore than half of LV= subsidiaries were set up to report using CDM and all teams reported substantial control improvements and user adoption of the solution. \u201cExisting Word and Excel formats were easily copied into CDM and our auditors loved that they, and ourselves, were able to track changes between versions,\nto the point where we had a single version of the truth when we produce our Company Annual Accounts,\u201d said Young.\nAs the implementation of CDM continued and the solution was introduced to the broader organization, the production of monthly management reports, weekly Management Information reports, financial risk reporting, and more became a part of the process\nas well.\nThe Results\n\u201cWe\u2019re pulling all the accounts into CDM now, and we built our CDM solution so that it refreshes quickly, straight from the underlying data, and then reviewers and management can look at our results a lot quicker than previously,\u201d said Young.\nFor the weekly Management Information pack alone, prior to CDM one person would spend several days a week collating data from different areas to gather the necessary information to produce the report \u2014 with CDM that process was cut down to 30 minutes.\n\u201cBefore we were producing eight separate monthly management information packs, which overall totaled 200-250 pages. We\u2019ve pushed that all into CDM so when we now issue our monthly packs they\u2019re all created from the same place, with consistent data appearing across the whole package, rather than having people pulling different information from different areas across the\ncompany, in different ways.\u201d\nCurrently, there are over 70 people using CDM and Young successfully rolled the solution out across the organization to improve accountability, consistency, and process control across all departments and making sure that all \u201ckeepers of data sources\u201d are aware of their responsibilities surrounding data.\nWith Certent CDM, LV= experienced a significant reduction in time spent producing recurring internal and external reports, increased controls around the process, gained a vote of confidence with their auditors, and reduced overall risk.\n"

        "content": "\nOverview\nSwedish Insurer Folksam has transformed its approach to financial and Solvency II reporting, automating manual processes to make the last mile of finance less labour intensive. Faster reporting cycles mean less time and personnel are needed to complete the close-to-disclose process, which leads to significant cost savings\nThe Need\nThe reliance on manual processes was threatening to hold Folksam back from delivering annual reports rapidly and reliably, and meeting the tighter quarterly reporting cycles required under Solvency II.\nThe Solution\nBy adopting a streamlined, automated approach to reporting, supported by CDM, Folksam can keep pace with ever-growing internal demands and Solvency II requirements.\nThe Benefit\nCDM enables rapid reporting; for example, annual reports can be created 40 percent faster on average. CDM also saves hours previously spent on manual validation, and drives more consistent, accurate reporting\nMoving away from manual processes\nAs a customer-owned company, Folksam works to satisfy the needs shared by many, and is always looking for opportunities to deliver greater value for its policyholders. The company realised that it could unlock considerable savings \u2013 and reduce business risk \u2013 by adopting a more efficient approach to financial reporting.\nAnders Jansson, Business Specialist \u2013 Finance at Folksam, explains: \u201cWe wanted a better way to manage the last mile of financial reporting. In the past, group companies created annual reports in Microsoft Word. It was a completely manual process in all aspects \u2013 different contributors had to copy and paste data from multiple source systems and spreadsheets. This introduced a high risk of error, and was also very time-consuming.\u201d\nRecognising that its traditional, manual approach to financial reporting was no longer capable of meeting the demands of the business, Folksam sought a way to shorten cycle times and increase the accuracy of its reporting processes.\nTaking financial reporting to the next level\nTo consolidate and streamline financial reporting processes Folksam uses Certent CDM. The solution automates the collection of business intelligence and performance management data from numerous source systems, including Cognos Controller and Cognos TM1 environments.\nToday, approximately 45 contributors from across the enterprise take advantage of the unified reporting and analysis platform to produce annual reports for a total of seven group companies. As up-to-date figures are integrated directly from source systems into the final report documents, Folksam can rest assured that all areas of the business are working with consistent, accurate information. \u201cThe business has a lot more confidence in the data,\u201d notes Anders Jansson. \u201cStandardising processes and reducing manual data entry has enhanced the quality of the data itself, and the focus has changed from manual processes to analysis and validation.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, we have established a series of business validation rules that help us to ensure the accuracy and consistency of reporting figures. Whereas teams used to spend hours validating figures in the past, this process is now done automatically, which saves a great deal of time.\u201d\nBetter control and visibility\nWith full visibility into financial reporting, users can easily monitor the status of the process, seeing which partners have completed their contribution workflows, and which are still outstanding.\nAnders Jansson comments: \u201cThe annual reports we generate are quite extensive, each totalling around 100 to 120 pages, so there are a lot of people involved in the writing and review process. Having better control and visibility of the entire process allows these teams to work together much more effectively.\n\u201cUsers can clearly see who has responsibility for each part of the process, whether it is writing a certain section of the text or updating a table or chart, and the current status of each task in the workflow. It\u2019s much easier to identify the source of any delays or bottlenecks, so that work can be kept moving.\u201d\nSaving time and money\nBringing enterprise-wide data together allows Folksam to create reports more easily and quickly than ever before, which is driving significant savings.\n\u201cTeams no longer need to hunt down data from multiple locations and enter it into different spreadsheets or documents \u2013 all the information they need is automatically integrated from source systems, and can be accessed with just a few clicks of a mouse,\u201d says Anders Jansson.\n\u201cWhile the time savings vary from report to report, we estimate that CDM has reduced the time taken to create annual reports by 40 percent on average. The time savings and quality improvements that we have achieved are directly contributing to a reduction in operating expenses.\u201d\nMeeting Solvency II requirements\nFollowing the success of its initial project, Folksam worked with Business Partner Attollo to extend the CDM solution to manage Solvency II reporting. Here, data is imported from a central DB2 database into CDM, where it is automatically integrated into a number of reporting templates. The solution also generates the relevant XBRL tags required to pass the automated validation process.\n\u201cOur users really appreciate the flexibility that CDM brings to the regulatory reporting process,\u201d states Anders Jansson. \u201cThe solution is very easy to work with, and has greatly simplified Solvency II reporting.\n\u201cOf particular benefit is how easy insightsoftware makes it for us to keep up with changes to the Solvency II quantitative reporting templates [QRTs]. Without CDM we would probably have to devote one to three full-time equivalents [FTEs] to development and maintenance work.\nLooking to the future\nFolksam is looking forward to driving greater efficiencies around other areas of enterprise reporting, and have decided to use CDM to support the qualitative reports required under Pillar 3, and the ORSA under Pillar 2 of the Solvency II framework.\nAnders Jansson concludes: \u201cWe consider CDM to be an indispensable part of the reporting process. The solution has already brought about big changes to the way our teams approach reporting, and we expect it to deliver even greater value as new business demands and regulatory requirements continue to emerge.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\nOverview\nThe Need\nA new XBRL mandate in Sweden calls for a new approach to reporting.\nThe Solution\nEnterCard used CDM to produce quarterly XBRL reports for the FSA, but set out to streamline their annual reporting process.\nThe Benefit\nCDM saved time, reduced risk of error, and reduced the amount of stress that comes with tight reporting deadlines.\nThe Situation\nA new XBRL mandate in Sweden calls for a new approach to reporting\nA joint venture between Barclays and Swedbank, EnterCard is a leading credit provider serving 1.7 million customers across Norway, Sweden and Denmark. As such, it\u2019s regulated by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) and the European Banking Association.\nWhen the FSA mandated that quarterly reports be filed with XBRL tags from June 2015 onwards, Anna Holmgren, Financial Specialist at EnterCard, realised that EnterCard\u2019s manual reporting processes were no longer viable.\n\u201cThe XBRL requirement was coming up quite quickly,\u201d says Anna. \u201cIt was urgent for us to find a solution that could generate XBRL files. More importantly, we needed to find something we could roll out quickly to ensure we met the deadline for the regulation.\u201d\nThe Transformation\nFrom manual reporting to XBRL compliance in just two and a half weeks\nThe approaching FSA deadline meant rapid implementation was a crucial factor when Anna Holmgren and her team were assessing different solutions. \u201cThe new regulation required us to start marking up with XBRL by the end of June 2015,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had two systems presented to us, and while both of them offered the XBRL markup we needed, CDM was the only solution we could deploy quickly in the cloud. That was important for both my team and the IT department.\u201d With the help of implementation partner Addedo, EnterCard was able to get started with Certent CDM quickly. \u201cWe started implementing CDM at the beginning of June, and had the whole thing up and running in two and a half weeks, including setting up our report templates,\u201d Anna recalls.\nThe Opportunity\nTo streamline the annual reporting process\nWhile EnterCard initially used Certent CDM to produce quarterly XBRL reports for the FSA, Anna and the team soon realised it could also improve the efficiency of the company\u2019s annual report process. \u201cBefore, we produced our annual report in Excel,\u201d Anna explains. \u201cThat was fine to a point, but as we produce the report in both Swedish and English, it meant there was a huge duplication of effort \u2014 and a big risk that different mistakes would creep into the different versions of each document.\u201d\n\u201cCDM helps you design your own reports, either on your own or by using a template,\u201d says Anna. \u201cAs we had an annual report to submit in two languages, as well as a holding company and two subsidiaries to report on, being able to design new report templates ourselves was a big time-saver. We can also use the system for our interim report \u2014 an added bonus for us.\u201d\nThe Results\nTime saved for financial analysis, reduced risk of error, and less stressful reporting\nNow that CDM is well embedded in EnterCard\u2019s finance function, the company has gained many benefits from the platform on top of its ability to submit reports in XBRL. \u201cThe largest win for us has been the time saved,\u201d Anna says. \u201cSome of our reports are quite big, so automating parts of our reporting process gives us more time to analyse the numbers rather than having to spend all our time just manually sorting out the reports.\u201d\nThe risk of errors has reduced, too. \u201cBecause we set up the validation rules ourselves, we know the numbers are correct,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s minimised the risk of wrong numbers. And because we have a single source for our data in CDM, it means we know every version is identical. There\u2019s no longer a need to check the English and Swedish versions of each report separately.\u201d Finally, CDM has also reduced the amount of stress that comes with tight reporting deadlines. \u201cWith CDM we can see if we\u2019ve done anything wrong long before we send off our report to the FSA,\u201d Anna says. \u201cWe can now validate all our reports and get true peace of mind \u2013 something we could never get when we reported manually.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\nOverview\nThe Need\nA platform to automate the preparation of financial reports including newly mandated XBRL tagging and reduce the amount of information needing to capture with the correct data to deliver an output format ready for filing.\nThe Solution\nDRDGOLD wanted to modernise and automate as much of the financial report creation work.\nThe Benefit\nFaster, more accurate, and lower-cost creation of external and internal reports with CDM.\nThe Situation\nXBRL mandates in the US and South Africa prompt a rethink of reporting processes\nFounded in 1895, DRDGOLD is one of South Africa\u2019s oldest gold mining companies and the longest continuously-listed company on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). It has an American Depository Receipts (ADR) program listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), requiring it to file an annual report on form 20-F to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in line with the rules governing foreign private issuers (FPIs).\nAs a midsize company with a small finance team of finance professionals and a Corporate IT budget largely limited to IT maintenance, DRDGOLD had been taking a manual approach to preparing financial reports for filing to the SEC and to South Africa\u2019s Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC).\nThe most onerous document to prepare was the Annual Report on Form 20-F, that combines a narrative front section with consolidated financial statements thereafter. The team had been preparing the financial data in MS Excel and the narrative section in MS Word, then manually retyping the financial data from MS Excel into the Word document.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the most fun thing to do,\u201d says Francois Bouwer, Group Financial Accountant for DRDGOLD. \u201cIt\u2019s a laborious, painful process, and when the pressure\u2019s on, you just want it to go quicker. But the more information you have to rekey, the more room there is for typing errors.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, DRDGOLD would send the completed report to an external service provider to convert it to an EDGAR-compliant format and file it to the SEC\u2019s EDGAR website. That process took 1\u20132 days for conversion, checking and validation \u2014 adding extra stress as the filing deadline approached.\nSo in 2018 when the SEC introduced a mandate for issuers to file statements in XBRL, Francois Bouwer and the team saw it as an opportunity to completely rethink the financial report creation process. \u201cWe wanted a platform that would automate the preparation of our financial reports including the newly mandated XBRL tagging and reduce the amount of information we had to capture manually,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething that would automatically populate reports with the correct data and deliver an output format ready for filing.\u201d\nThe need became even more pronounced when the CIPC swiftly followed the SEC\u2019s example and mandated iXBRL reporting for companies in South Africa. \u201cNow we were looking at XBRL reporting in two jurisdictions at the same time, which meant more of a big-bang switch to XBRL than we\u2019d expected,\u201d says Francois Bouwer. \u201cIt drove us to look for a solution that would tick both boxes.\u201d\nThe Transformation\nAutomated report creation and XBRL tagging with Certent CDM\nDRDGOLD knew they wanted to automate as much of the financial report creation work as possible, rather than simply outsource the XBRL tagging element. \u201cThat was a very quick decision,\u201d says Francois Bouwer. \u201cWe wanted to modernise and automate our processes, not just do XBRL because we had to do XBRL\u201d.\nThe team evaluated a number of solutions. Several did not meet the brief because they only automated the XBRL tagging aspect, and not narrative report preparation or output into a format ready for filing. Of the remaining options, Certent CDM was selected because it enables automated creation of multiple types of reports on a familiar interface with all the capabilities of MS Excel, Word and PowerPoint as well as apply XBRL tags using the different taxonomies used by the SEC and the CIPC and produce output in a format ready for filing.\nThat was partly down to the knowledge and expertise of insightsoftware and its South African partner Synergy, recently rebranded to iOCO, who gave Francois and the team confidence they would be able to configure the\nCDM platform to meet DRDGOLD\u2019s reporting requirements.\n\u201cThey had the capacity to assist us to build the financial statements on the platform and to help with the tagging for the local and US markets because our capacity was limited,\u201d says Francois Bouwer. \u201cIt felt like there was a good network to support us in both jurisdictions.\u201d With CDM selected, insightsoftware and iOCO worked closely with DRDGOLD to build the Form 20-F and annual financial statements in the platform, automate the pull of data, apply the required XBRL tags, and prepare the reports for filing in the required format, such as EDGAR for the SEC.\nAs the implementation progressed, DRDGOLD saw opportunities to automate more reports. Populating the 20-F was the main focus, but DRDGOLD also added other ad-hoc filings on form 6-K. A dry run confirmed that DRDGOLD was ready to file the 20-F and other reports using CDM, and the first 20-F was successfully prepared and filed through the platform on 31st October 2018 with the XBRL document being filed at the end of November 2018.\nThe Results\nFaster, more accurate, and lower-cost creation of external and internal reports\nIt\u2019s still early days for DRDGOLD with CDM, but the team have already experienced a number of benefits from using the platform.\nFirstly, the time and cost of using an external provider to convert the report from MS Word to EDGAR have been eliminated. \u201cGenerating the 20-F report is now just a question of pressing a button and it is virtually\ninstantaneous,\u201d says Francois Bouwer. \u201cThat reduction in time is a big element of the upside.\u201d\nSecondly, as the team creates reports in the CDM platform, they are starting to realise the benefit of automated data population. \u201cFor the 20-F, all of that laborious rewriting of numbers in Word has been avoided,\u201d says Francois Bouwer. Looking ahead, he expects to free up time to focus on the narrative, with the numbers dynamically flowing into the final report.\nXBRL tagging for two jurisdictions is another major benefit, allowing the team to keep report creation in-house rather than outsource the work to third party. And finally, there\u2019s the flexibility of CDM to automate many different types of reports. While DRDGOLD started with annual reporting, it\u2019s now exploring other areas where CDM can save time and improve accuracy \u2014 such as IAS34 interim financial statements and quarterly Board reports.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking across the finance function to see where else we can roll CDM out,\u201d says Francois Bouwer. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to saving time and effort across our workflows.\u201d\n"

The company leverages its technology-based platform to create a competitive marketplace.\nAs a forward-thinking tech company, innovation is a core value, informing both their product and how they operate. For the company\u2019s finance team, that meant seeking out an innovative and more automated way to handle manual financial reporting processes.\nManual reporting processes were slow and error-prone\nPrior to deploying insightsoftware, assembling and producing public filings was a manual process. There were opportunities for input errors and version confusion when an update or change was made beyond the first draft, in part because there was no way to link the document directly to source data. In addition, embedded Excel-based tables were a problem, often causing files to become corrupted, creating formatting inconsistencies, and added risk because numeric changes in the embedded tables could not be tracked in Word. What\u2019s more, only one person could work on a document at a time.\nReinventing reporting\nThe company\u2019s finance team wanted a way to reduce risk caused by its manual approach to reporting. Automating and streamlining its processes would reduce the time devoted to reporting, the number of manual touchpoints, and the potential for risk and error.\nBy innovating its reporting systems, the team was looking for smoother and more efficient collaboration, faster time to report completion, and greater accuracy throughout the reporting process.\nImproved efficiency would also deliver secondary benefits by giving the finance team more time to create robust narrative insights to explain and support its reported data.\nHow they chose insightsoftware\nThe team reviewed a number of providers, ultimately selecting insightsoftware in part because several team members had used the platform at a prior employer and knew it would offer the Microsoft integration, ease of use, and innovative features they were looking for.\u00a0 They also saw insightsoftware as a company equally committed to innovation, which meant the platform would meet their needs for many years to come.\nOther factors in the decision included:\n\nAs an on-premise solution, insightsoftware met the company\u2019s internal\u00a0security requirements and would allow for direct connection from a unified data source to published reports\ninsightsoftware represented the most cost-effective solution\ninsightsoftware offered comprehensive training and support to get the team rapidly up to speed and keep them apprised of new features and capabilities\n\nAs the implementation moved forward, insightsoftware helped build out the client\u2019s baseline financial statements. Already familiar with the platform, the team\nwas then able to easily create the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), press release and investor decks.\nReport production is now dynamic and streamlined\nWith insightsoftware in place, the finance team can confidently generate accurate financial statements, MD&A, press releases, and quarterly investor slide decks ready for release at the push of a button. The entire process is streamlined and controlled, with the majority of manual touchpoints for report production eliminated. The company can now have full confidence in the integrity and accuracy of the financial information within each document and across all its reports.\nOther benefits of its insightsoftware deployment include:\n\nExcel-based charts, graphs, and other visualizations are seamlessly integrated and\u00a0 properly formatted, making reports graphically rich and more engaging for stakeholders\nThere are far fewer proofing checks and reviews required, saving review time for the finance team\nMost aspects of the reports are automated, including income, loss, and gain sections, speeding report preparation\u00a0and improving accuracy\nAll team members can now share and access the multiple sections of the reports simultaneously, enabling efficient collaboration while maintaining tight version control\nTime savings are reinvested in enriching the narrative story and explanations that bring context to the company\u2019s disclosures\n\nNext up: XBRL\nHaving achieved all the goals the team initially set for the project, the company knew it could leverage the XBRL and EDGARization capability.\n"

He knew it was essential that the tool pass muster with their auditors. The research uncovered that insightsoftware offered the best combination of broker neutrality and cost effectiveness, and provided a comfort level for both the finance team and the auditors.\nOnce the company had selected insightsoftware, the controller and one of his team members worked together to complete the implementation. \u201cinsightsoftware made the data conversion process easy, helping us format data properly and working with us to tie back to our Excel spreadsheets.

Reporting required a raw data dump and massive recalculation for several million tranches which took seven or eight days. The company needed an ASC 718 compliant reporting tool to handle NQSOs and RSUs for its 15,000 employees around the world. Manual reporting was riddled with risk and not a scalable solution.\nThe Transformation\nThe technical accounting manager recognized that the current software was not GAAP compliant, and he began researching what was available. Upon meeting with insightsoftware, the company discussed its wish list for ASC 718 compliance, batch reporting, and additional functionality specific to multinational companies. insightsoftware met many of the requirements out of the box, was willing to develop new reports to meet the rest, and offered the ability to group and filter participant data by line item, which was a big plus. The technical accounting manager was excited about the flexibility insightsoftware offered to allow the company to continue using its administration solution.\nThe Results\nWith Certent Equity Management in place, the client was able to scale from 11,000 participants to 16,000 over the first year. The client was able to process more grants, reduce errors, and use less skilled labor to do so: \u201cOn average, we process 37 tranches per grant given the 12-month cliff vesting and the forfeitures have to be applied on a tranche basis. CEM handles the forfeiture calculations right.\nIn addition, Certent Equity Management doesn\u2019t allow for a termination date before a hire date. We\u2019ve significantly reduced the risk of human error and our SFAS 123R reporting process no longer requires people with deep FAS expertise to be involved at the detail level.\u201d\nAs a result of the new process, the company shaved a full three days from the seven or eight it used to take each quarter to do its calculations and reporting. It no longer needed another set of eyes to verify the accuracy of the spreadsheet calculations. The audit took less time once the auditors were able to do their work more quickly using CEM. Finally, the client found dramatic time savings by using the common stock equivalent report, which provides dilutive values of equity compensation for the earnings per share calculation.\nAs with many insightsoftware customers, this client was able to eliminate reliance on an Excel spreadsheet ripe with pivot tables, macros, links and tabs that was a challenge to audit due to its complexity and nonstandard output. With insightsoftware, the client now had a standard output that provided the high level data, with an audit trail tracking where all the numbers came from. All the data the team members needed to produce filings was at their fingertips, and the burden of reporting on their stock plan decreased dramatically.\n"

But as a relatively small bank, there was not a dedicated full-time employee to administering its equity compensation plan, which was managed using spreadsheets and paper documents.\nThings changed in 2013, when Atlantic Capital embarked on a growth strategy. An acquisition of Tennessee-based FSG Bank was on the horizon, and an IPO after that. Spreadsheets, with all their potential for error, were no longer suitable for managing and reporting on equity compensation.\n\u201cAs a company with a view to an IPO, we needed stronger control of our environment,\u201d says Shannon Morrison, the bank\u2019s Senior Vice President and Director of Risk Analytics. \u201cThe risk of accounting errors is much higher in spreadsheets, and equity compensation requires complicated calculations\u2014especially with stock options. If we had stayed with spreadsheets, there was a greater risk of making a mistake in our financial statement.\u201d\nThe Transformation\nFrom manual processes to comprehensive control, reporting and self-service.\nWith the acquired bank also bringing its own equity compensation plans, it made sense to invest in a software solution \u2013 both to manage the combined plans and to apply the appropriate accounting treatment for disclosure to the SEC. After evaluating the options, Atlantic Capital Bank chose Certent Equity Management, a comprehensive, web-based solution that can handle many different types of equity compensation\u2014from stock options to performance share awards.\n\u201cAt the time, we were using restricted stock and stock options, but we wanted a solution that could move us forward if there were other types of equity awards that we were going to explore,\u201d says Morrison. \u201cIn fact, in 2017 we were able to start offering a hybrid performance share award in full confidence that Certent Equity Management could handle the complex calculations involved.\u201d\nCertent Equity Management delivers many other benefits, too. The software automates much of the admin that was previously manual\u2014from setting up the plans to producing accurate figures for internal and external reporting. Time spent handling inquiries has also been minimized, as the Certent Participant Portal allows employees to log in to review their awards, accept the terms, and keep track of their plan\u2019s performance.\n\u201cBefore, people had to print and sign documents,\u201d says Morrison. \u201cNow, they sign off their awards through the portal. If they haven\u2019t completed their agreement, we can ping them a reminder. It\u2019s removed a great admin and compliance risk.\u201d\nThe Results\nAn intuitive system that unlocks a world of equity compensation possibilities.\nToday, Atlantic Capital Bank is using Certent Equity Management on a weekly basis to administer its equity compensation plans and export accurate data for internal and external reports. It\u2019s enabled the finance team to stay lean, too. \u201cIf we were still managing equity compensation with spreadsheets and documents, we would have needed another head count,\u201d says Morrison. One additional benefit of choosing Certent has been the wealth of expert advice and support available to Atlantic Capital Bank\u2014particularly when it comes to introducing new award plans.\n\u201cThe performance share award was very new for us and no one here had any experience of setting one up,\u201d explains Morrison. \u201cinsightsoftware helped me set it up in the system and handle what we thought was a very complicated equity award. It turned out to be really straightforward because the system allows us a lot of flexibility and functionality.\u201d Atlantic Capital Bank is confident that with insightsoftware, they have an easy-to-use equity plan management solution that minimizes admin and risk and ensures financial statements are accurate. What\u2019s more, they have an expert partner on hand to help with any inquiries and enable the bank to add new types of equity awards in future if required.\n\u201cThe folks at insightsoftware are very knowledgeable,\u201d says Shannon Morrison. \u201cI\u2019ve used their support when I\u2019ve just had a question about an accounting or tax-related matter and received a prompt answer. Sometimes I feel like I need some expert backup\u2014and with insightsoftware I have exactly that.\u201d\n"

Since partnering with insightsoftware in 2018 and adding Jet Reports and Jet Analytics to its portfolio, Optimus has been able to offer its customers richer, more robust reporting, budgeting, and business intelligence solutions that have led to significant business growth. \nOver many years, Optimus has built trust among its loyal customer base in the Americas and Europe. They\u2019ve helped customers of all sizes in areas such as retail, consumer packaged goods, food and beverage, and hospitality. This success was recently recognized when Optimus was awarded the Top 100 VAR for 2020 by Global Insights Publication. The Top 100 resellers are organizations specializing in the sale and implementation of ERP and accounting software. \nThe Challenge \nDespite the historic success Optimus had enjoyed and their proven track record of assisting their customers to implement, upgrade, and maintain Microsoft Dynamics systems, with the shift from on-premise solutions to the cloud, in the form of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (365BC) and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management, Optimus noticed that customers were reluctant to make the move at first. A common concern was that their historic data could get lost when migrating from older ERP and Point-of-Sale (POS) systems to newer solutions.\nAt the same time, most of Optimus\u2019 customers relied on the old, inflexible Management Reporter tool for financial reporting or they exported the data to Excel to manually format and manipulate them. In both cases, this was inefficient and not giving their customers\u2019 finance teams the flexible, self-service reporting capabilities they needed.\nFinally, most customers also relied on manual processes and multiple spreadsheets to manage their budgeting process in GP or NAV. Again, this was inefficient and also prone to error.\nOptimus felt its customers deserved better. So, the company determined to look for a software partner with a strong track record in the Microsoft Dynamics world, who could provide solutions to help with data migration during upgrades to avoid data loss, and to fill other functionality gaps where its customers were currently using Excel or native tools for reporting and budgeting.\nBuilding to Success with Jet\nIn 2018, Optimus evaluated the market to find the best reporting and analytics solutions partner for its customers. After an extensive search, it decided to partner with insightsoftware to offer the Jet Analytics and Jet Reports products.\nWhat originally piqued their interest was Jet Analytics, which they realized solved the issue of potential data loss that was concerning customers who were thinking of migrating to 365BC. By importing their legacy data into Jet Analytics\u2019 pre-built cubes and tabular models and then connecting to 365BC, customers can seamlessly report over their historic and current data, without having to go through a lengthy and risky data migration exercise.\nFor financial reporting, most of Optimus\u2019 customers are looking to upgrade from the native Management Reporter tool. They are looking for something more flexible and that puts finance in control of their own reporting. Jet Reports is Optimus\u2019 recommended replacement for Management Reporter.\n\u201cWith Jet, our customers benefit from real-time information, simplified reporting, and interactive dashboards,\u201d said Hector Negron, Managing Director at Optimus. \u201cWe now recommend Jet to all of our customers right from the start, because it\u2019s a robust product that we trust. In fact, we have recommended Jet in all four RFPs we have completed in the last three weeks.\u201d\nImplementation time varies, but most customers see value immediately. Simple implementations take a maximum one week. More complex implementations, like a recent budgeting project for a civil aviation customer, can take up to three months. For shorter or longer implementations, the payback is clear. The budgeting project delivered savings both in setup and throughout the budgeting cycle.\n\u201cJust the process of building out the formulas for budgeting took the civil aviation customers about two months each year, just for that year,\u201d said Negron. \u201cWith Jet, they were able to configure everything in just two weeks and can now use that same configuration over and over again, while still maintaining the ability to adjust as needed. With Jet, the whole budget cycle was then compressed from two months down to three weeks.\u201d\nBeyond its software, Optimus values insightsoftware\u2019s investment in their channel, with benefits like volume rebates, marketing accelerator rebates, training, and certification built in to their partner program.\n\u201cinsightsoftware\u2019s culture and how easy they are to work with is the gold standard for how it should be to work with ISVs,\u201d said Negron. \u201cinsightsoftware helps us grow our business and actually puts their own skin in the game while doing it.\u201d\nThe next step for Optimus is to implement Jet in their own organization next year. Its finance team went through an internal RFP process and thoroughly evaluated Jet against other products, but, hands down, Jet was the clear winner.\nNavigating Success\nThanks to the partnership with insightsoftware, Optimus has been able to expand into an entirely new area of business with its existing Microsoft Dynamics customers solving concerns about data loss when moving to 365BC, providing robust budgeting capabilities, and offering a flexible, financial reporting solution, which is critical as Management Reporter moves toward end of life. The results of this partnership speak for themselves with Optimus enjoying record revenues and now having created a new, dedicated 10-person BI practice:\n\nLast year was a record year in revenue for Optimus. Last quarter, while businesses were impacted by Covid-19 quarter, its revenues surpassed those in Q3, 2019.\nNinety percent of its new RFPs include at least one of the Jet products.\nOptimus intend to expand its business intelligence practice by offering Jet to its Sage customers.\n\n"

        "company": "MTN Congo",
        "content": "\n\nAfrica\u2019s mobile economy has grown rapidly in recent years. For many, a mobile phone functions as not only a communication device, but also their primary means to access the internet. Over the past decade, mobile adoption has reached 444 million, and is predicted to grow another 4.6 percent by 2025 to reach 634 million subscribers.\nFormed in December 2005 when MTN International acquired LIBERTIS Telecom, MTN Congo is available in more than 476 localities and villages of Congo Brazzaville, and covers more than 80 percent of the Congolese population. To meet these demands, MTN Congo employs nearly 300 direct employees and is responsible for more than 10,000 indirect jobs. They boast over 1 million subscribers who use a variety of different services, including conference calls, credit transfer service, and both post- and pre-paid mobile packages. This generates a plethora of financial and operational data, all stored in their Oracle ERP system. But getting that information out in a usable fashion proved to be a bigger challenge than anticipated.\nThe Selection Process\nCompanies across the globe struggle to close their books faster and with more accuracy every month, and MTN Congo had been no exception. Each month, the Corporate Performance Management Team would export their balances from Oracle E-Business Suite into Microsoft Excel. From there, they would manually manipulate cost center data into the correct format, a difficult and time-consuming process that took two full days and two full nights every month. \u201cEach month, we felt scared because it was such a difficult task,\u201d recalled MTN Congo\u2019s, Planning and Budgeting Manager Dzondo Pr\u00e9cieux.\nIn addition, Pr\u00e9cieux and his team had to produce a budget variances report comparing budget versus actual values and distribute by department. As an intensely manual process, this task took three to four days to complete. Often, those long days stretched into long nights as well. It was clear the group needed a solution to make the process easier.\nFortunately, MTN Congo was introduced to insightsoftware\u2019s Wands by their Oracle consultant. After being strongly advised to consider the Wands, MTN Congo purchased GL Wand, Budget Wand, and Reports Wand.\nImplementing Wands\nMTN Congo was up and running on Wands in no time, and Pr\u00e9cieux saw benefits almost immediately. \u201cNow for reporting, we only take one day. We start reporting when the Financial Accounting Team has put the journals in, and then we can extract balances and start analyzing. We start at 7 am and around 4 pm we are done,\u201d marveled Pr\u00e9cieux. \u201cGL Wand allows us to automatically get all the information that we need. It\u2019s very good.\u201d\nThe long, monthly budget reporting process has experienced similarly impressive improvements. \u201cAfter reporting each month, I have to produce a budget follow-up report, and this report has to be distributed by department: HR, finance, marketing. In the past, this was a manual task. I spent around three to four days and had to work hard all night,\u201d recalled Pr\u00e9cieux. \u201cBut now with Wands, in one day, I can produce all these reports for all our departments.\u201d\nWands boast an ease of use that has saved MTN Congo more than time: It has saved money, too. \u201cEven after we brought in Budget Wand, we had a consultant we paid to come in and load our budget into Oracle,\u201d said Pr\u00e9cieux. \u201cThen I heard that this did not have to be the case with Budget Wand. So I went into the Wands Customer Success Community where I discovered a short video demo and was able to train myself to load the budget. So now we can manage this in-house and do not have to pay a consultant.\u201d\nThe Customer Success Community has been a great source of knowledge for Pr\u00e9cieux and his colleagues: \u201cI have helped some users in overseas with two tricks and it was very helpful.\u201d\nMTN Congo currently only uses Wands in its finance department, although there are several sub-departments within Finance, including Pr\u00e9cieux\u2019s own Corporate Performance Management department. \u201cOthers can see how GL Wand has improved our work, though, and now everyone wants to be a GL Wand user,\u201d Pr\u00e9cieux said.\nNavigating Success \nUsing Wands, MTN Congo has automated what were previously time-consuming manual processes while improving data accuracy at the same time. \u201cIt has made my life easier,\u201d Pr\u00e9cieux said. He has seen benefits in the form of time savings and ease of use for both template building and cost center tracking. The team also has greater confidence in the accuracy of their data. \u201cGL Wand allows us to easily do some checks for control,\u201d Pr\u00e9cieux added.\nReporting success for MTN Congo hasn\u2019t just been found in time and money savings, but also in improved work/life balance. \u201cWith Wands, in one day, I can produce all these reports for all our departments,\u201d noted Pr\u00e9cieux. \u201cSo I can relax on the weekends and enjoy time with my family. I can actually rest at home now because I have GL Wand.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nBased in Raleigh, North Carolina, PRA Health Sciences is a global healthcare intelligence partner that develops life-saving and live-improving drugs through comprehensive clinical development services. With more than 16,000 employees in over 75 offices around the world, PRA Health Sciences does work that truly has impact worldwide. And reporting on all that activity is truly a full-time job.\nAdministrating CXO Software\nBy the time senior manager of financial planning and analysis Katie Howard joined PRA, the accounting team had already been using CXO Software for close to two years. \u201cThe decision on CXO Software had been made in 2011,\u201d Howard recalled. \u201cPrior to that, PRA was using Excel dashboards.\u201d\nFor herself, Howard began using CXO Software in 2013, even before moving to the Public Accounting department. \u201cIt\u2019s the most widely used tool in Finance at PRA,\u201d Howard said. After moving to Public Accounting, Howard began training as an Administrator for CXO Software. \u201cI always compare CXO Software to Hyperion Financial Management (HFM) because I took on both duties at the same time,\u201d she admitted. \u201cCXO Software is a lot easier and a lot more user friendly.\u201d\nWhen Howard took over as Administrator, PRA was using CXO Software version 5.3. \u201cWe still had to navigate to a remote desktop to design reports,\u201d Howard recalled. \u201cBy the time we updated to the newest version, we found out we were the only CXO Software client still on the oldest version.\u201d She worked through the new upgrade with the insightsoftware team, learning the Administrator duties at the same time. \u201cThere was a little bit of a learning curve because we had skipped a few versions in our CXO Software update,\u201d Howard said. \u201cBut when I started taking over, it wasn\u2019t difficult. And the support team is incredibly responsive any time I\u2019ve had an issue.\u201d\nUpgrades Promote Further Efficiency\nUpgrading to the newest release dramatically impacted their reporting process timelines for the better. \u201cOne of our biggest time-savers from CXO Software was actually a byproduct of us upgrading,\u201d Howard recalled. \u201cBefore, we would load information from Hyperion HFM into CXO Software, and it would take about 30 minutes. Now it takes about 5 minutes. The data load is instantaneous.\u201d\nWhen it comes to report building, efficiency goes even beyond time spent. \u201cRecently, I built a report to show revenue for our early business development unit and was able to break it out between geography and subunits,\u201d said Howard. \u201cIt was really a time saver because now the leaders don\u2019t have to pull out individual reports. We\u2019ve built a lot of efficiency in through aggregating reports.\u201d\nOne major benefit Howard has noted from CXO Software is a reliable single source of truth (SSOT) for financial reporting across the organization. \u201cCXO Software gives a much better high-level view by business unit\u2014monthly, quarterly versus budget versus forecast\u2014without having to train all our users on pulling HFM Smart View reports,\u201d Howard said. \u201cAnd if we have to pull a report a different way, we can use CXO Software as a tie out to reconcile against.\u201d\nAn additional bonus in the shifting financial economic landscape of early 2020 has been the opportunity to create reliable reports that employees can access from anywhere, especially when instructed to work from home. \u201cI have recently created a few new reports and views for people to see as they work from home. With Hyperion, we would have server issues or it would go down and you couldn\u2019t access what you needed,\u201d Howard remarked. \u201cCXO Software is incredibly reliable, and a good place to find information.\u201d\nNavigating Success\nToday, PRA Health Sciences uses CXO Software for most of their P&L reports and several balance reports as well. \u201cWe use it every month for month-end close,\u201d Howard said. \u201cEvery time they consolidate month-end actuals in Hyperion\u2014usually three times a day for the first five days of the close process\u2014they would also update in CXO Software. I\u2019m also able to easily refresh CXO Software dashboards any time we update a budget, quarterly forecast, or meta data.\u201d\nPRA Health Services has improved its report creation and access, including:\n\nReduced information load time by more than 80 percent\nReliable remote access for reporting and report views\nSelf-service reporting that limits the need for IT involvement\n\n\u201cCXO Software works really well for us,\u201d Howard concluded. \u201cWe have good information on how we\u2019re trending against actuals and forecast, prior year actuals, all sorts of different things. CXO Software is reliable, a good place to find the information we need, and a highly visual tool for our executive team.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nWisconsin-based Renaissance Learning makes cloud-based pre-K\u201312 educational software and adaptive assessments. The company is known for creating Accelerated Reader, which is used in about 35,000 schools, as well as Star computer-adaptive assessments (found in more than 37,000 schools), with Star Assessments being the most widely used computer-adaptive assessment in the US pre-K\u201312 educational market.\nThe Challenge\nWhen Ted Wolf first came to Renaissance as VP Global Controller, finance relied on Microsoft FRx for their Epicor ERP reporting. Once he learned that FRx was being phased out, Wolf remembered a tool he\u2019d first heard about 10 years prior, an Excel-based reporting solution called Spreadsheet Server. \u201cBased on my knowledge of Spreadsheet Server, I liked the tool and how it operated; I liked operating in Excel,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cReporting in Excel from an accountant perspective is the only way to go.\u201d Thus, Spreadsheet Server became the new tool for their Epicor ERP.\nThe Renaissance team quickly ramped up on Spreadsheet Server and provided better data visibility across the company. \u201cIn Epicor, our world was very silo-based,\u201d Wolf admitted. \u201cSpreadsheet Server took it to an automated world where I could change the date and press a button, and the world would be updated.\u201d\nThe team\u2019s first impression of Spreadsheet Server was its incredible speed. \u201cImagine a workbook with 25 tabs that all have to be updated,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cOur old way was to print and rekey all the information. Once we had Spreadsheet Server and got the data set to look at the right parameters, we click update and it\u2019s done.\u201d Wolf had utmost confidence in the accuracy of the reporting that he produced through Spreadsheet Server. \u201cYou never had to worry about the integrity of the data unless you as a user screwed up the segments.\u201d\nWhen Renaissance decided to move to a new ERP and implement NetSuite, they needed all of their data to come along and arrive with total accuracy. Not knowing what new reporting on NetSuite would look like, Wolf was pleasantly surprised to learn that Spreadsheet Server had recently released a new connection to NetSuite. So, they began the migration process from Epicor to NetSuite.\nBuilding Success with Spreadsheet Server \nThe key to a smooth transition for the Renaissance team was accuracy and ease of verification. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going through verification, if you can keep part of your world consistent,\u201d Wolf said, \u201cthat makes it so much easier. Going through that exercise and using the power of Excel is huge.\n\u201cWe brought in a year\u2019s worth of transaction history. We have a lot of data and the amount of transactions that go through. [There are] millions of records you\u2019re trying to go through and make sure you\u2019re not changing your history.\u201d\nUsing historical data standpoints, the teams first ran spreadsheets from Epicor, then from NetSuite, and then compared the two. They built segment lists in NetSuite based on those they\u2019d built for Epicor. They created category codes in NetSuite for Spreadsheet Server, which allowed Wolf to go through the transition on historicals and data to match up and get what he needed. Everything was good to go. All the data came over accurately. Although Wolf says the look and feel of Epicor and NetSuite are a little different, the reporting looks the same because of Spreadsheet Server, and there has been noticeable, solid consistency.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see what this new system can do now,\u201d he said, roughly a week after the migration took place. \u201cSpreadsheet Server gives me a lot of control.\u201d\nNavigating Success \nWith this proof of success using Spreadsheet Server\u2014first with Epicor and now the success of migrating data over to NetSuite\u2014Renaissance is planning to add other data sets into Spreadsheet Server once they have NetSuite fully set up.\nSpreadsheet Server has produced with NetSuite just as Wolf anticipated it would. Looking back, he still marvels at how the tool opened up the reporting process. Some of the primary benefits seen by Renaissance with Spreadsheet Server include:\n\nSaving four to six hours of processing time each month\nReducing closing cycle time by a full day with access to real-time data\nSeeing total reporting time savings of a day and a half every month\n\nAll that extra time allows the Renaissance team to dig into value-added activities, instead of being mired in data dumps and manual manipulation.\n\u201cSpreadsheet Server took it to an automated world where I could change the date and press a button and the world would be updated,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThe ability to right-click and get to everything you need and export it out is what makes Spreadsheet Server a great tool.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nCalifornia-based third-party logistics (3PL) corporation Custom Goods has experienced extensive growth over the past several years. The 3PL solution operates a 3 million square foot distribution network. Its primary location is in southern California, with additional facilities in Illinois, Kentucky, and South Carolina, and a new Texas location planned for 2021.\nThe Challenge\nFor the last three years, Custom Goods has been using a NetSuite ERP solution. Brought in by corporate controller Guillermo Pineda, the solution initially provided what the then-smaller company needed for financial reporting. \u201cNetSuite is a great product,\u201d Pineda affirmed. \u201cBut what I was missing was the reporting aspect.\u201d\nIn 2017, the organization operated on a smaller scale, which meant that while reporting was time consuming, it still only took one day for a single employee to complete the job. \u201cWith the standard reporting, we were downloading information, manipulating it, putting in formulas, all that,\u201d Pineda recalled. \u201cOne person in one day could do the job, but as we started growing, it added more and more hours, and then another person. We\u2019d publish the financials and then be told someone forgot a bill or expenses, so we\u2019d have to reopen the books and go through the whole process again.\u201d\nAs Custom Goods grew from five locations to 15, Pineda knew the current pace would be unsustainable for business success. \u201cI started asking other companies what they were using,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of them came back with dashboards like Power BI. But those are just dashboards. They aren\u2019t reports that give you details and transactions.\u201d\nBy 2020 with no solution yet in hand and reporting that was now taking upward of several business days, Pineda began paging through the options available on the NetSuite Suite Apps site, where he came across Spreadsheet Server by insightsoftware. \u201cSpreadsheet Server looked interesting, so I requested a demo,\u201d he said. \u201cThe demo was done by a controller, someone who knew my language and knew what I needed. I knew Spreadsheet Server was exactly what we were looking for.\u201d\nBuilding to Success with Spreadsheet Server\nOnce Pineda decided on Spreadsheet Server, he prepared for a two to three-week installation, expecting to run his first set of Spreadsheet Server financial reports in June 2020. \u201cI got a phone call, and the insightsoftware team downloaded the product onto our machines, and we were up and running,\u201d Pineda marveled. \u201cI told my reporting manager the tool was ready, but we were still planning to wait. He thought we could do it. So, he gave it a try. He was able to build the financial report and we were able to use Spreadsheet Server that same week we were set up.\u201d\nBecause of Custom Goods\u2019 set up, they needed to be able to provide reporting at the customer level, not just to warehouse location level. \u201cOne location may have up to ten customers,\u201d Pineda explained. \u201cBut we don\u2019t just look at the location overall, we need to look at the customer level, so we allocate expenses appropriately to track rates and contract extensions. Having the P&L by customer helps us make a lot of decisions more easily.\u201d Accomplishing this meant creating report templates in Spreadsheet Server which used custom segments from their NetSuite ERP Solution, something the team at insightsoftware was happy to accommodate.\n\u201cWhen we first used Spreadsheet Server, we didn\u2019t have the custom segments,\u201d said Pineda. \u201cBut everything we do in NetSuite is by customer: We bill by customer, allocate rent and labor by customer. Now that we have custom segments set-up with our Spreadsheet Server reports, a facility manager can ask for a P&L statement for a specific customer and I can have what I need in minutes so the facility manager can make the best decisions.\u201d\nThe customer-level reporting that Custom Goods values used to be the very thing that would hold up their reporting process. \u201cIn some locations, we can have up to 20 customers. Previously, we had to download their information one by one, format, and add formulas at the bottom. We couldn\u2019t even template the reports because the formulas would change each time,\u201d Pineda recalled. \u201cWith Spreadsheet Server, we build the formulas at the bottom of the report, and all we have to do is refresh the information.\u201d\nNavigating Success \nWhile only two months into their Spreadsheet Server usage, Custom Goods is already experiencing success with Spreadsheet Server. \u201cWe\u2019ve only done standard financials so far, but now we\u2019ll get deeper into dashboards, KPIs, and individual reports by location,\u201d said Pineda. \u201cSince we\u2019re all set up, now we can really start working.\u201d\nSome of Custom Goods\u2019 early successes with Spreadsheet Server include:\n\nQuick time to value, producing reports the same week the solution was installed\nReducing a two-person, multi-day reporting process to only 3 hours managed by one employee\nAutomated customer-level reporting using custom segments\nImproved data integrity due to consistent, automated formulas\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen my reporting manager so happy to actually do reports,\u201d Pineda concluded. \u201cIn my career, purchasing Spreadsheet Server is probably the best money I\u2019ve ever spent. It was well worth it.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nFor nearly a century, IXYS UK Westcode has been at the forefront of power semiconductor design. What began as Westcode Semiconductors making copper oxide based semiconductors expanded into silicon power devices in the 1950s. Westcode was acquired by the IXYS Corporation and became part of a worldwide organization pioneering development of power semiconductors, solid state relays, high voltage integrated circuits, and microcontrollers. In early 2018, IXYS was acquired by Littelfuse, a leader in circuit protection. The combined organization has a customer base of 100,000, and more than 50 locations across America, Europe, and Asia.\nThe Challenge\nPrior to being acquired by Littelfuse, IXYS UK Westcode had a reporting process that involved downloading a trial balance from their JD Edwards ERP software into Excel, manipulating it into a variety of formats, and then importing it into different static spreadsheets. All of this was quite a time-consuming task. \u201cIt was all a bit slow and cumbersome,\u201d recalled IXYS Financial Controller Simon Hatfield. \u201cBut, you got used to it. It was normal to be working this way.\u201d\nAltogether, Hatfield\u2019s team would take a full day just to manually create their spreadsheets. Once the spreadsheets were compiled, Hatfield\u2019s team would then have to upload the numbers into Oracle Hyperion and analyze the output in order to complete GL mapping journals. Hyperion uploads could take up to an hour each and were run multiple times throughout the close process. The entire month-end close process with all its manual input took five business days.\nWhen IXYS was acquired by Littelfuse, the team knew that changes were coming, including changes in how much time they\u2019d have to close the books. \u201cWe knew that we were going to be pushed by Littelfuse to shorten the close window,\u201d Hatfield recalled. \u201cThere\u2019s more work to do after we\u2019ve produced our numbers for Littlefuse, so they want as much time as possible.\u201d\nThat was when Hatfield first encountered Spreadsheet Server by insightsoftware. \u201cIt sounded like a great idea, so I followed up,\u201d he said.\nBuilding to Success with Spreadsheet Server\nIXYS added Spreadsheet Server, carefully setting up and checking report structures to be sure everything was done correctly. \u201cOnce a report is set up, you know you can rely on it and you don\u2019t have to worry about the accuracy,\u201d Hatfield said.\nGoing from manual reporting to automated reporting templates that could simply be refreshed each month via live data pulling directly from JD Edwards was an enormous time savings. \u201cThe ability to save time was the biggest attraction of Spreadsheet Server,\u201d Hatfield admitted. \u201cWe do a daily shipping report, which previously was another download from JD Edwards. Now we simply change the date and push a button. It\u2019s great. We are finding time savings all over the place.\u201d\nAs for shrinking the close process as required by Littelfuse? Spreadsheet Server made it easier to trim time off of that as well. \u201cWhen it comes to month-end reconciliation, you don\u2019t have to go find the balance, because it\u2019s already there,\u201d said Hatfield. \u201cI just change the date and the information pops up.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also no more waiting on multiple uploads to Hyperion. \u201cBefore, I had to wait until we uploaded information into Hyperion, then download more information and do analysis,\u201d Hatfield said. \u201cNow there\u2019s no need to do that: I have all the information I need in a Spreadsheet Server report, which saves us from making extra steps in the process and speeds everything up.\u201d Indeed, the IXYS month-end close process dropped from five days down to two and a half.\nBut time savings wasn\u2019t the only benefit. Hatfield\u2019s team now has the freedom to consider and analyze numbers and look at variances. \u201cIt\u2019s all less of a rush at month-end to be able to do those things because we\u2019ve finished that much more quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also get certain reporting requests from other departments that we\u2019re able to answer more quickly now using the functions of Spreadsheet Server.\u201d\nNavigating Success \nIn the first six months of having Spreadsheet Server, the IXYS team has been very busy, adding inventory reports from Spreadsheet Server to their report pack. While they\u2019re currently using Spreadsheet Server to a degree to assist with budgeting, next steps will involve installing Budget Accelerator, a Spreadsheet Server companion product that will make it easier for the team at a local level to compare numbers to the budget, a process today that is quite manual.\nEven though the IXYS team has had Spreadsheet Server for less than a year, they\u2019ve already experienced the following benefits:\n\nCut month-end close process timing by 50%\nSaved several hours by removing the need to perform multiple Hyperion uploads\nGained more time to analyze numbers and resolve variances\n\nIXYS\u2019 success with Spreadsheet Server in the first six months is only the beginning. \u201cI think we\u2019ve really only scratched the surface of how we can use Spreadsheet Server,\u201d Hatfield said. \u201cWith a little more time, I know we\u2019ll be able to get even more benefits out of it.\u201d\n"

        "company": "WEC",
        "content": "\n\nExecutive Summary\nTo accelerate its revenue forecasting cycle, improve the quality of the results, and eliminate a myriad of problems associated with using a variety of disparate legacy systems, WEC implemented a single instance of Longview Plan (planning budgeting, and forecasting) for use across its multiple business units. Analysts are now better able to prepare budget and revenue forecasts and meet requests from business units, executives, and energy regulatory auditors that demand comprehensive and accurate business data to support rate increases.\nA Recognized Leader in Energy Supply and Services\nThrough subsidiaries such as Peoples Gas and Light, Minnesota Energy Resources, Wisconsin Public Service, and a number of others, Chicago-based holding company WEC Energy Group, Inc. provides natural gas and electricity products and services to both regulated and non-regulated energy markets in the north-central US. On the regulated utility side of the business, which generated nearly US $4 billion in total revenue for fiscal year 2009, approximately 4,500 employees helped supply 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity and nearly 400 trillion BTU equivalents of gas to just over two million customers.\nBenefits at a Glance\n\nImproved automation results in less effort, fewer errors, and faster forecast turnaround\nFaster error detection/resolution reduces forecast cycle times and workload\nSingle forecasting platform standardizes processes and reduces staffing risk\nSingle system simplifies data extraction for regulatory submissions\nBetter data quality increases confidence of executives and regulatory auditors\nExtensive modeling capabilities address unique business unit requirements\n\nThe Challenge\nTo support timely and effective decision making for their regulated utilities, the company\u2019s senior management relies on information provided by revenue forecasts conducted throughout the year. For each of the six subsidiaries, there are typically one or two full projections each year that look out 42 months, plus monthly pricing updates.\nInherent in the design of a regulated utility, each forecast process is different because the \u201crate design\u201d (i.e., the structure of how a utility bills its customers) is different for each type of customer\u2014urban/rural residential, commercial, industrial, etc. As a result, forecasts were done separately within each business unit, with each using its own people, processes, and tools.\nThis approach presented some challenges, which were further compounded by the merger and acquisition (M&A) activity that had originally led to the formation of the company and continues today as a key WEC business strategy. Each business unit used a different forecasting process and different tools, which included custom systems based on SAS Business Analytics software, homegrown spreadsheets, APL language, and in-house development based on Microsoft Visual Basic and SQL Server.\nLegacy Approach Inefficient and Risky\nNot only was the company-wide forecasting a very labor-intensive, manual process that often yielded dispute-prone results, the various forecasting tools used by the individual business units were antiquated, difficult to maintain, and required scarce skill sets.\nThrough the M&A process, sales and revenue forecasting work was brought together to form a single Sales and Revenue Forecasting department. Although this resulted in a net decrease in overall forecasting resources, analysts from each business unit were still using their individual legacy systems, thereby increasing forecasting complexity.\n\u201cWe knew that, going forward, having multiple tools was inefficient from a process perspective and risky in terms of cross-training and backup coverage amongst the analysts,\u201d said David Clabots, Manager of Sales and Revenue Forecasting at WEC. With several added business units and reduced staffing, revenue forecasting had to become very efficient.\nClabots added that error detection was also a major pain point that had significant impact on forecasting deadlines. Because WEC forecasts are based largely on historical data, an error in that data could significantly impact the forecast, but none of their legacy forecasting systems provided error alerts or sufficient data-validation methods. As a result, errors were not detected until quite late in the process, at which point the analyst would have to fix the error and start the process over again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long, complicated process, so it\u2019s painful to find an error at the back end and have to go back to the beginning and do it over again,\u201d said Clabots.\nRate Cases Require Huge Amounts of Data\nIn the US, gas and electricity are highly regulated businesses that are monitored closely at various government levels, primarily through state-level utility boards. Each rate change requires permission from the utility board\u2014a process referred to as a rate case\u2014that is contingent upon WEC providing a large amount of business data to justify the change. For Revenue Forecasting, having to pull all this data from multiple, disparate systems was labor-intensive and consumed weeks of the analysts\u2019 time.\n\u201cThis year, we anticipate filing six rate cases, a record for this organization and a significant amount of work,\u201d said Clabots, citing a previous WEC rate case example in Illinois that resulted in more than 1,900 data requests from Board auditors.\nAll these challenges, along with a strategy to continue pursuing M&A opportunities, provided a strong impetus for WEC to optimize its forecasting approach based on a single forecasting method and single system platform.\nThe Solution\nAfter spending several months defining what they wanted in an integrated process and standardized forecasting tool\u2014and preparing a detailed list of requirements\u2014WEC undertook an RFP exercise to select a single, new, third-party forecasting system. A selection committee was formed consisting of the forecasting analysts plus representatives from IT, the business units, upstream suppliers, and senior management.\nHalf a dozen prospective bidders were compared based on RFP responses, customer reference calls, and financial reviews. Bidders also conducted three-day, onsite, custom demos based on a prepared set of scripts that focused on the features WEC was most interested in.\n\u201cWe also did some profiling on each vendor to analyze their financial viability, see how much they reinvest in their own business, and to gain some initial understanding as to how much we would be able to rely on them,\u201d explained Clabots.\nLongview Emerges as Best Potential Partner\nAs a result of the review, the selection committee chose the Longview Performance Management application as their new forecasting solution.\n\u201cLongview Plan surpassed the others in terms of \u2018demonstrated functionality\u2019 for the things that were high on our list to accomplish with a new system, especially in the area of modeling,\u201d said Clabots, whose department uses many different forecasting models based on customer type and associated rate design. \u201cThe Longview modeling language is very flexible and would accommodate many varied requirements and allow us to do all the necessary calculations, right down to the individual customer level,\u201d added Clabots. According to Kirsten Walker, an outside consultant engaged by WEC to manage the selection and implementation of the new forecasting tool, the committee also looked for the vendor with whom they felt they could have the best relationship.\n\u201cWe looked at the quality of Longview\u2019s interactions with us throughout the entire review process, and everyone we talked to and met with from Longview portrayed that partnership-style attitude we were looking for,\u201d said Walker, adding that they felt the Longview people were a better fit culturally and were more flexible and thus more likely to work well with WEC\u2019s group of very precise and exacting analysts.\nConfigurability Key to Deployment Success\nThe roll out of the Longview application at WEC was done on a business unit basis, starting with smaller business units for testing purposes, then proceeding to those scheduled to start an actual forecasting cycle. As unplanned priority tasks elsewhere in the business consumed Revenue Forecasting resources, more of the application configuration work had to be pushed onto the Longview people in order to maintain the schedule and budget.\n\u201cI can\u2019t compliment the Longview architects and developers enough,\u201d said Walker. \u201cA lot of specialized processes, data hierarchies, and models had to be designed and implemented, some of which were quite complex, and it was Longview\u2019s ability to quickly understand these and configure their system to do them very well that was the key to a successful deployment.\u201d\nThe Results\nThe greater degree of automation provided by Longview Plan has reduced manual forecasting effort, cycle time, and potential for errors. According to Clabots, the errors that used to be detected late in the process that set their schedule back as much as two weeks are now detected much sooner, and it\u2019s a simple matter for analysts to rerun the forecast in just minutes. It is also quick and easy for WEC analysts to produce reports that check the results of a forecast or compare one version of a forecast with another.\n\u201cThis also allows us to better audit results ourselves before the forecast goes to senior management or before data is submitted as part of a rate case,\u201d stressed Walker. \u201cWe can detect and fix errors easily and be prepared to explain any oddities that may appear in the data, all of which reflects well on the credibility of our process and resulting data, and builds confidence with executives and jurisdictional auditors.\u201d\nFrom a management perspective, consolidating all revenue forecasting onto a single Longview application makes it easier for analysts to cross-train, allows them to share workload during peak periods, and reduces the risk associated with losing a staff member.\n\u201cNot only has Longview allowed us to stay ahead of the game with respect to continued requests to do more with less in a difficult economy, it better positions us to support any continued growth through mergers and acquisitions by making it easier to bring additional business entities onboard,\u201d said Clabots, who concluded his comments by adding that the Longview people have bent over backwards to support them along the way. \u201cDuring the implementation, and even now that we are fully operational, Longview has consistently collaborated with us to come up with creative ways to help instead of just giving us the standard responses. We all agree that they are a genuine partner in our business.\u201d\n"

        "content": "\n\nExecutive Summary\nFor nearly ten years, leading property and casualty insurance providers, RSA, has been using Longview Close and Longview Plan to automate and streamline financial management processes to improve its financial and operational performance. The Longview applications allow regional departments to abandon manual and time-consuming processes so they can dedicate more time to interpreting key financial information and packaging it to give decision makers better insight.\nCompany Profile\nRSA Canada includes Roins Financial Services Limited, Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Company of Canada, Quebec Assurance Company, Johnson Inc., GCAN Insurance Company, Western Assurance Company, Ascentus Insurance Ltd., Canadian Northern Shield Insurance Company, RSA Travel Insurance Inc./Assurance Voyage RSA Inc., and is part of the RSA group of companies headed by RSA Insurance Group plc.

In 2010, the Canadian Group wrote $2.1 billion in direct premiums with assets exceeding $5.8 billion. Internationally, RSA Insurance Group plc employs about 22,000 people and has the capability to write business in 130 countries, and in 2010 its net written premiums were \u00a37.5 billion. RSA is a trade name of Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Company of Canada. \u201cRSA\u201d and the RSA logo are trademarks used under licence from RSA Insurance Group plc.\nChallenges\n\nReduce reporting deadlines from 10 days to 5 days\nInefficient, manual processes and spreadsheet tools\nTime-consuming processes tied up resources from performing adequate financial analysis\n\nBenefits at a Glance\n\nCumbersome, manual processes and spreadsheets eliminated\nReduced forecasting cycle time and improved financial data integrity across the organization\nStreamlined processes for gathering, reconciling, and aggregating financial data from subsidiaries and regions across Canada\nUnified, consistent view of financial and operational performance based on real-time data from a single repository\n\n\nNicole Heidinger loves her finance job in the Toronto headquarters of insurance company RSA, one of Canada\u2019s leading property and casualty insurance providers. Heidinger is RSA\u2019s manager for management reporting and analysis, and she\u2019s been with the company for 10 years. She\u2019s proud to point out that RSA\u2019s parent company, UK-based RSA Group, is one of the biggest players in the global insurance markets, with operations in more than 30 countries. It\u2019s also one of the oldest, with roots going back deep into the 18th century; the company celebrated its 300th birthday in 2010.\nYou don\u2019t get to enjoy that kind of longevity by ignoring the technology advances of the day, whether it\u2019s those new-fangled telephones in the early 1900s, or, today, the corporate performance management (CPM) systems that drive decision making at forward-looking businesses. RSA was quick to see the value of this software category; the company has a long history of attendance at Longview Solutions\u2019 annual user conferences (actually it\u2019s tied for the record), and has been an enthusiastic user of Longview Consolidation since 2002. Heidinger has been around long enough to remember the excitement of that early implementation: \u201cAt first it was a case of, okay how do I use this? And then once I learned how to do it, I just wanted to automate everything I possibly could.\u201d\nRSA started its Longview journey with Longview Consolidation, which dramatically simplified and streamlined its processes for gathering, reconciling, and aggregating financial data from its subsidiaries and regions across Canada. A budgeting, planning, and forecasting implementation soon followed. Longview Plan quickly gave RSA a unified, consistent view of its financial and operational performance based on real-time data from a single repository.\nIn those early days, though, the new systems were far from pervasive within RSA\u2019s finance organization, and many staffers continued to cling to familiar, though inefficient, manual processes and spreadsheet tools. Even so, RSA was easily meeting its reporting deadlines using just a fraction of the systems\u2019 power. But nothing stays the same in business for very long, and in 2006, RSA was challenged to cut its reporting timelines by five days in Canada. \u201cWhere we had reported on business day 10, now they wanted us to report on business day five,\u201d said Heidinger. \u201cIt was a huge, huge change for us because so many things were still manual, with no automation.\u201d\nIt was clearly time to get serious about leveraging the full power of Longview CPM and rolling it out to more of RSA\u2019s finance pros. Fortunately, the company could call on some confirmed Longview enthusiasts to help with training.\u00a0\u201cWe had a few people aboard who were really good with the software, so they were a huge help in training people,\u201d said Heidinger.\u00a0\u201cAt the beginning of a project like this, it\u2019s very normal for people to have a bit of fear of change, but it\u2019s just such an easy tool to use that the training sessions went very well. For a lot of our people, once they saw what they could do with this, they were very excited.\u201d\nEven Heidinger, a veteran Longview evangelist, achieved some new breakthroughs as the drive for more automation gained traction. A report that had previously taken her a week and a half to complete now took just a few hours once the additional automation was in place.\nNowadays, all of RSA\u2019s internal monthly and quarterly reporting, for the regions as well as top-level management, comes from the Longview system.\u00a0\u201cBefore, it was a huge manual process,\u201d\u00a0said Heidinger.\u00a0\u201cEach individual from each department used to contribute one sheet or one working paper, and one person would put it together and build it into a book and we would print it. It\u2019s been quite a revolution.\u201d\nAchieving the new, compressed reporting deadlines was just one of the wins. In addition, the broader adoption of Longview Consolidation and Planning quickly freed up finance staff from a wide range of manual processes. Tasks that previously required the full attention of two or three people now needed just one, giving the department more time to focus on interpreting key financial information and packaging it to give decision makers better insights.\nThis outcome was particularly appreciated by management. In an uncertain national and global economy, business leaders need all the help they can get from timely, high-quality financial information, and RSA\u2019s leadership team is no exception.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s now more about analysis,\u201d\u00a0noted Heidinger. \u201cIt\u2019s about \u2018give us the numbers, but also give us the story behind the numbers.\u2019 That adds more value to what we provide.\u201d\nThese stellar results didn\u2019t go unnoticed at RSA\u2019s parent company in the United Kingdom. Every year, the London HQ gives each of the national finance offices around the world scores for the timeliness and quality of the finance information they produce. Heidinger recalled an RSA global conference in London, where she met the controller for Italy. The conversation went something like this:\nController for Italy:\u00a0So you report to Antonietta Montisano\u2014she\u2019s your department\u2019s controller?\nHeidinger:\u00a0Yes, she\u2019s my boss.\nController for Italy:\u00a0You know, I have her picture on my wall.\nHeidinger:\u00a0Really? Why?\nController for Italy:\u00a0Because Canada\u2019s scores for quality and timeliness of reporting are the highest in the world. Every time I look at that photo, it encourages me to compete with her and beat her scores!\nA laudable ambition, no doubt, but the Italians have some catching up to do. The Canadian group\u2019s timeliness score is always 100 percent and the score for the quality of the information provided is always over 90 percent, according to Heidinger.\u00a0\u201cNobody has beaten those scores yet,\u201d\u00a0she added.\nAnd how does RSA Canada\u2019s controller feel about being a finance celebrity recognized in international circles?\u00a0\u201cI guess if you\u2019re going to be known for something, that\u2019s not a bad thing to be known for!\u201d\u00a0laughed Antonietta Montisano.\u00a0\u201cIn a dynamic and complex environment like ours, there is an increasing demand for timely and accurate financial results. Our Longview application has given us the tools that we need to not only keep up with this demand, but to effectively react to change.\u201d\nMeanwhile, RSA Canada has no intention of allowing the pace of innovation to slacken, and Heidinger will be keeping a close eye on Longview\u2019s new technology offerings as RSA heads into its fourth century of writing insurance.\n"

The challenges of using multiple spreadsheets to manually input data, review formulas and links, and the frustration of repeating the process every time there was a change to book data became too great. The finance team was putting in a new accounting system and they wanted to standardize with tax. Lastly, the auditors were starting to take a more detailed look at the data, including ticking and tying, so they began asking to see the Excel spreadsheets to support the reported results. GATX decided to be proactive, as it was only a matter of time before the auditors focused more on uncovering errors or lack of internal controls instead of reviewing the results, so they engaged Longview to implement Longview Tax quickly.\nThe Objectives\nMove away from an Excel-only solution to:\n\nStandardize reports across the business segments\nEliminate Excel-based schedules\nEasily report in multiple ways (accounting entity code, business segment, and legal entity)\nLeverage data between the provision and the tax return instead of \u201cstarting over\u201d\nEfficiently and accurately calculate return to provision adjustment and tax basis balance sheet\nQuickly respond with results when accounting data changes\nAutomate as many book/tax difference as possible\n\nThe Solution\nWith Longview\u2019s easy to implement product, GATX quickly implemented:\n\nOut-of-the-Box Longview Tax Provision including Return to Provision and Tax Basis Balance Sheet\nIntegration between Longview Tax and GATX\u2019s accounting ledger system and Corptax compliance system\n\nWhy Longview?\nGATX reviewed the tax technology market and selected Longview Tax over the competition because of:\n\nMultidimensional enterprise database that provides a consolidation platform for unlimited data storage and drill-down/roll-up transparency to data\nUser friendly/Intuitive User interface\nOut-of-the-Box Provision solution\nFlexibility in reporting and automation options\n\nBenefits\nWith the implementation of Longview Tax, GATX has benefited by:\n\nIncreased efficiency by cutting the close timing by more than 50% in the first year\nIncreased standardization across the tax process and with finance\nImproved transparency and internal controls by centralizing all data in one database\nFlexible reporting\nRisk mitigation by eliminating Excel-only solution\n\n"

        "company": "Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport",
        "content": "\n\nExecutive Summary\nThe Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) implemented the Longview Performance Management application to replace a labor-intensive process that involved complicated spreadsheets and an antiquated system with a single, integrated process. Improved expense and revenue allocations and better interim reporting give DFW full visibility into all aspects of their budgeting and forecasting process, enabling important business decisions to be made earlier and eliminating year-end surprises.\nKey Outcomes\n\nLabor-intensive manual tasks and complicated spreadsheets eliminated\nExtensive drill-down capabilities improve problem identification/remediation\nBetter support for interim P&L reporting and timely decision making\nProcess integration saves staff time and reduces chance for error\nSupport for non-financial revenue drivers improves forecasting accuracy and timeliness\nFull visibility and reporting on capital budget allocations and cash flow\n\nBusiness Challenge\nThe costs of running DFW are covered by a combination of user fees and payments from the individual airlines using the airport that amount to roughly 35 percent of the airport\u2019s overall operating budget for FY2007. Its revenue sources include landing fees; parking; terminal rent, use fees and concessions; ground and facility leases; utility services; hotel and rental car operations; taxi, limo, and shuttle fees; and employee transportation.\nAnnual settlement with airlines\nThe annual settlements to the airlines are a major contributor to that complexity. DFW is operated as a \u201cresidual\u201d airport, which means that there is a settlement at the end of each year in which the airlines are either charged an additional amount if there is a shortfall in operating revenue, or they receive payments back from DFW in the case of any revenue residual over and above operating expenses.\nExtensive departmentalization\nThe airport\u2019s financial complexity is compounded by its extensive departmentalization\u2014for accounting and reporting purposes\u2014into 112 different departments, 80 cost centers, 10 business units, and hundreds of customers, including the airlines and other terminal tenants such as shops, restaurants, and concessions. For example, DFW uses 29 cost centers to track and budget the direct Operating and Maintenance costs for its five terminals. They have to allocate debt service to the terminals based on historical capital costs incurred over the past 35 years, allocate overhead and other costs, and then subtract concessions credits based on enplaned passengers per airline\u2014all of which is just to calculate the actual cost of each terminal. Then, at year end, the finance team has to settle with each airline based on the actual rentals paid compared with the actual terminal costs.\n\u201cThis is ridiculously complicated,\u201d said Chris Poinsatte, CFO and Executive Vice President of Finance and IT. \u201cAnd the system and process we were using for budgeting expenses and forecasting revenue was simply inadequate for our needs.\u201d\nAlthough the system did allow them to accumulate costs by department, it didn\u2019t allow for costs to be allocated by cost center, which is how they really manage and run their business, nor did it allow the costs to be spread by month.\nTime-consuming, manual processes\n\u201cAll this had to be done manually,\u201d said Poinsatte. \u201cWe had to download data from our old system into this 40-tab Excel spreadsheet in which we could massage the numbers to come up with budgeted expenses and projected revenues for the different cost centers and business units and then spread them by month.\u201d\nPotential for errors\nThe results would then have to be loaded into their Oracle General Ledger\u2014in which actual expenses are captured and accumulated throughout the year\u2014so that actuals and variances could be reported monthly. Overall, this was a very tedious and iterative process that took a lot of time and created the potential for errors. It also made it difficult for DFW to forecast revenues until all their budgeted costs were finalized and known.\n\u201cWe clearly needed a new system and a new approach that would bring this long, arduous process all together,\u201d said Poinsatte.\nThe Solution\nAfter conducting an RFP exercise that included proposals and demos from a number of companies, DFW chose to replace its antiquated budgeting and forecasting system with the Longview Performance Management application for strategic finance. The selection committee consisted of the CFO, AVP of Budgeting, IT Manager, a procurement person, a representative from the Minority Affairs Department, and the Financial Analyst who runs the system.\nBetter drill-down capabilities\n\u201cWe felt the Longview Platform would be the best overall solution for our needs,\u201d explained Poinsatte. \u201cNot only was the price good, it offered us much better drill-down capabilities and it was going to be easy to configure the system for the various charges, rates, and fees we use for our different revenue sources.\u201d\nSimplified budgeting and forecasting process\nIn explaining their choice of the Longview Platform, Poinsatte went on to say that the system would simplify their budgeting and forecasting process by allowing different types of roll-ups\u2014for example,roll-ups by department, by expense category, by cost center, and by business unit\u2014for projected expenses and revenues. And because the system would allow both expenses and revenue to be allocated by month, they would be able to create a monthly P&L projection by business unit, which they had never been able to do before.\n\u201cThe Longview Platform was going to allow us to slice and dice our numbers any way we wanted to,\u201d said Poinsatte. \u201cAnd all with the push of a button.\u201d\nDFW implemented the Longview Platform in phases: Expense Budgeting the first year and Revenue Forecasting the second year, to be followed by Capital Project Cash Flow Forecasting and Balance and Income Statement Reporting. A Longview implementation team of two experienced technicians did the system design and configuration for the Expense Budgeting side, and then DFW assigned one of its own for most of the design for the final allocations on the Revenue side of the implementation.\n\u201cWe had very tight implementation timelines, and the Longview team was very focused on meeting our needs,\u201d said Poinsatte. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t like some spreadsheet project\u2014we had to have people working on this who really knew what they were doing, and when we had problems, or if things slowed down for any reason, the Longview folks were all over it.\u201d\nThe Result\nImproved interim reporting capabilities\nDFW gained substantial advantage from the Expense Budgeting phase of their Longview implementation. During the budget development process, DFW was able to allocate expense budget items to cost centers\u2014information used to set the airport\u2019s fees and charges\u2014and spread those numbers by month based on historical trends rather than being limited to just dividing a total annual number by 12 as before. This in turn gave DFW improved interim reporting capabilities.\n\u201cNow we can identify variances or discrepancies at the cost center level on an ongoing monthly basis, and we\u2019re able to resolve them with the help of Longview\u2019s extensive drill-down capabilities,\u201d said Poinsatte. \u201cThis eliminates the potential for big settlement surprises at year end.\u201d\nEliminated manual spreadsheet processes\nWhen they implemented Revenue Forecasting, DFW was able to tie its expense budgeting and forecasting into a single, integrated process\u2014no more spreadsheets, no interim manual steps, and no more need to correlate numbers or do monthly allocations manually. By combining what were previously two separate processes that mixed automation with manual tasks into one fully automated process, DFW saved a significant amount of staff time and effort, and greatly reduced the chance for errors.\n\u201cLongview gave us full visibility into both the expense and revenue sides on a real-time basis, allowing us to make business decisions throughout the year instead of having to wait until year-end when all the numbers are in,\u201d said Poinsatte.\nSimplified year-end settlement process\nPoinsatte went on to say that with the Longview Platform, they are now also able to accumulate, store, and report on the non-financial data that drives their revenue forecast numbers. Acres of land, landed aircraft weights, number of passengers, and square footage of terminal space leased are the primary drivers behind DFW\u2019s various rates, fees, and charges. Unlike their previous system, Longview supports both the drivers and the financial numbers, and by extending the use of the system out to those DFW departments that keep up with the revenue-driver information on a daily basis, the system can be kept up to date with current information. This results in real-time revenue forecasts that are more accurate than ever before, and provides data that greatly simplifies the year-end settlement process with the airlines.\nMore effective use of funds\nWith financial information on all the capital projects now managed in the Longview application, DFW has full visibility and reporting capability on the budget allocations and cash flow, and can readily shift funds from one project to another (some projects may progress while others may be delayed or canceled altogether), allowing funds to be used more effectively.\nResponsive support from design to implementation\n\u201cLongview\u2019s technical support team has been very responsive in supporting us throughout the design and implementation of our Longview solution,\u201d said Poinsatte, who went on to say that when the current \u201cuse\u201d agreement with the airlines comes up for re-negotiation in 2009, the Longview application will be an important tool in supporting DFW\u2019s ability to change to a new business model in the future.\nDetailed cash flow projections by project\nAnother area of considerable complexity that the Longview application has enabled DFW to address is managing the budget and cash flow projections for capital projects at the airport, of which there can be as many as 150 to 200 underway at any given time. The funds for these projects need to be allocated and managed out of many different \u201cbuckets.\u201d Previously, the finance team had no visibility throughout the year as to when, or even if, the capital funds allocated to a given project would actually be spent or how the cash flow would be distributed monthly.\n\u201cUsing the Longview application, we designed a solution that manages all these individual buckets and gives us detailed cash flow projections by project,\u201d explained Poinsatte. \u201cNow we know exactly where all the money is and when it will be spent, and we can start to hold project managers accountable for properly estimating their capital expenditures.\u201d\n"

        "company": "Dassault Aviation",
        "content": "\n\nThe Client\nDassault Aviation is a leading aerospace company with a presence in over 90 countries across five continents. It produces the Rafale fighter jet as well as the complete line of Falcons. The company employs a workforce of over 11,000 and has assembly and production plants in both France and the United States, and service facilities around the globe. Since the rollout of the first Falcon 20 in 1963, over 2,500 Falcon jets have been delivered. Dassault offers a range of six business jets from the twin-engine 3,350 nm large-cabin Falcon 2000S to its flagship, the tri-engine 6,450 nm ultra-long range Falcon 8X and the new ultra widebody cabin Falcon 6X.\nKey Outcomes:\n\nScalable planning and budgeting that will grow with the company\nVisibility and control throughout the budgeting process\nStreamlined, consistent reporting across divisions and offices\nAutomation of previously manual processes prone to errors and delays\n\nThe Goal\nDassault sought to move away from balky and labor-intensive Excel-based dashboards. The company needed to automate its reporting process to create easy access, customize, and use views of its performance at a given time and over several different time frames. Being able to capture key business performance measures at any time was necessary not only to optimize operational performance, but also to tie Dassault\u2019s financial details and organization to its production strategy. Manual processes were prone to errors and offered limited functionality for digging into the details and causes of variances between periods and between budgets, forecasts, and reality.\nTo overcome the tedium, lack of control, difficulty in locating sources of errors, and little insightful information produced by Dassault\u2019 s legacy spreadsheet program, Longview sought to deliver a system that automated as many processes as possible. Longview leveraged Dassault\u2019 s decade of experience and historical data on the central platform to accomplish the goal of enabling the company to make better decisions based on dynamic, responsive, data-informed results and trends.\nThe Challenge\nCreating a positive and intuitive user experience for Dassault\u2019s management team was key to obtaining buy-in and adoption of the new reporting system. Longview proposed tailoring the tool to capture, manipulate, and present data that allowed executives and managers from various departments to visualize a consistent version of the company\u2019s manufacturing performance, operating costs, and key performance measurements. The transformation of historical data, standardization of hierarchies, and a focus to introduce crucial data elements were the first steps ensuring the dashboard communicated the entire story.\nOnce that was accomplished, the software could take over, slotting data into appropriate categories, compiling, and consolidating figures from across the enterprise. Eliminated manual processes cut out data entry errors and overrides, ensured all data was accounted for and correct, and drastically reduced the amount of administrative resources required to finalize reports and plans.\nThe Solution\nThe implementation of Longview Analytics software allowed Dassault to pull together all its planning data from its general ledger, job-costing system, and diverse regional offices into a central database. Longview worked with the company to build several customized dashboards for displaying historical revenue and expenditures as well as models of future performance based either on historical data or hypothetical scenarios based on possible strategy shifts or market forces.\nLongview Analytics includes demonstrations and training for Dassault\u2019s managers. They were able to see firsthand and in hands-on learning sessions how the new tool would enable them to complete their reports faster and more accurately. The built-in comment and collaboration tools allows them to share information that make the reports more robust and increase their value in operational decision making. The ability to drill down into each category to examine period-to-period anomalies and trends makes them more efficient. This new transparency also engendered greater trust in the performance numbers and confidence in the allocation of marketing, information technology, and other shared costs among individual projects and offices.\nMost importantly, Longview Analytics dashboards ensure optimized workflows that are trackable and viewable in real time. Incorporating email alerts and making the dashboards accessible via mobile and handheld devices empowers Dassault to adjust forecasts, budgets, and goals and to react quickly to market opportunities.\nThe Result\nDassault managers now have the ability to access critical decision-making information viewable on intuitive dashboards. By distributing single-version realities, the company engages all stakeholders, soliciting comments and facilitating collaboration.\nLongview\u2019s capabilities will ensure Dassault can manufacture time-sensitive reports quickly so it can take advantage of identifying trends and needed action to ensure the adherence to the production schedule. Longview\u2019s scalability ensures the system will expand with the company, adding functions as needed and allowing micro-views of business assumptions that may need to be altered.\n"

        "content": "\n\nFounded as a one-man business in 1966, Netherlands-based tire wholesaler Heuver also boasts international teams in Germany, England, and Romania to help manage their expansive wholesale activity across Europe. With a range of more than 10,000 products, Heuver\u2019s systems creates large volumes of data that need to be managed by a data warehouse for accurate reporting and BI dashboards. \nThe Challenge\nIn 2019, Heuver decided it was time to upgrade their ERP system and migrate from a 2009 instance of Microsoft Dynamics AX to the latest version of Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations. Part and parcel to this move, however, was a need to do modernize their data warehouse, which was becoming more and more difficult to maintain. \nLike many organizations, Heuver\u2019s data warehouse was built using custom SQL coding, which left them dependent on a few skilled resources to maintain and update their system. \u201cWe had to rely on a consultant to make even the most simple updates,\u201d recalled Thijs Selhorst, Heuver\u2019s administrator of BI tooling. \u201cIt would take two days and was incredibly costly.\u201d With the move from Dynamics AX to 365, it was the right time for Heuver to do work on their data warehouse. \nWhen upgrading to Dynamics 365, Heuver also had several years of historic data they needed to migrate to ensure they could continue to run both comparative and trend reports, and comply with audit requirements. Migrating this data to the cloud and validating it would be very costly and time-consuming.\nThe Selection Process\nAlready connected to insightsoftware through their TARGIT BI reseller, Selhorst had been working with the team to maintain and extend Heuver\u2019s existing data warehouse and OLAP cubes, implemented using standard Microsoft technology. As Heuver prepared to move from its legacy ERP to a cloud-based ERP, the transfer triggered a need for an extended data warehouse far beyond what their current setup was able to accommodate. \nThat\u2019s when insightsoftware stepped in to discuss Jet Analytics. \u201cFirst we went to our ERP partner, who had a product for BI tooling. But we did not get the business case for that,\u201d Selhorst said. \u201cSo we went to our insightsoftware partner, Joost Tiggeler, and he provided a good business case with Jet Analytics. It was the first time I was introduced to Jet.\u201d \nJet Analytics, insightsoftware\u2019s data warehouse automation platform, enables Dynamics customers to accelerate and de-risk their BI projects without requiring specialist skills.\nFor Heuver, Jet Analytics also offered the possibility to mitigate the risk of data migration by avoiding the need to load historic data into Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations, instead combining legacy AX and current Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations data in the data warehouse for reporting and analysis.\nImpressed by both the capabilities and the affordability, Selhorst and his team decided to move forward with Jet Analytics. \nImplementing Jet Analytics\nJet Analytics proved its worth immediately. \u201cTo set up the data warehouse, it was a lot faster with Jet. While I don\u2019t know the exact time it took us to do the same thing with Visual Studio before, with Jet, it was less than 30 days,\u201d Selhorst recalled. \nThe new data warehouse setup through Jet Analytics allowed Selhorst to easily access both current and legacy data. \u201cThe data warehouse is really simple,\u201d Selhorst said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get the data and I understand it. When there are questions I can answer it. I\u2019m not a programmer, I don\u2019t really understand SQL. I\u2019m a finance guy,\u201d he added. \u201cIf I can work with a data warehouse, then you know it\u2019s really simple to use.\u201d \nSelhorst learned Jet Analytics both with a consultant and via two training sessions, and is confident in navigating the solution. \u201cYou can click, drag, and drop, then look at the outcomes.

        "content": "\nAbout the Customer\nMulticonsult is one of Norway\u2019s leading firms of consulting engineers and designers. Established in 1908, the company has played an important role in Norway\u2019s development and economic growth. The company provides a range of services including multidisciplinary consulting and design, project engineering and management, verification, inspection, supervision, and architecture both in Norway and overseas.\nSituation\nIn September 2017, Multiconsult changed ERP systems. The related BI solutions didn\u2019t work as planned, so Multiconsult urgently needed to find a way to perform financial reporting in the beginning of 2018. Because their previous ERP reporting solution didn\u2019t have the capability to perform financial planning and reporting, Business Controllers resorted to using Excel for financial planning and analytics.\nMulticonsult had an urgent need for fast and accurate reporting as the company was publicly listed \u2014 other systems couldn\u2019t do the job fast or well enough. Developing a Power BI reporting tool would be time-consuming and expensive, so Excel was used instead, compromising data and analytics quality.\nSolution and Results\nMulticonsult acquired a company in September 2017 that was already using Bizview. After reviewing the solution\u2019s capabilities, Multiconsult decided to also implement Bizview for financial planning, reporting, and analytics. Jan Helge Golmen, now Finance Director at Multiconsult, had been using Bizview prior to the acquisition as part of the acquired company.\nBizview came with the possibility to build interfaces, register own sets of data, and combine different sources in one datastore. A first crucial report was created in Bizview in a relatively short time. In less than two years, Bizview had been scaled up to a company-wide reporting, planning, and analytics solution used by more than 2000 employees. Bizview now handles everything from project management to budget, forecasting, management reporting, risk management, HR, and more. There are plans to extend Bizview to even more areas within the organization.\nThe key to efficient user adoption across thousands of employees has been extensive training in the local offices, delegating responsibility over different areas to a few selected \u201csuper users,\u201d and simplifying the solution to the extent possible.\n\u201cIt went relatively fast to implement Bizview,\u201d said Jan Helge Golmen. \u201dWith Bizview, we have significantly improved our project management. We now have a seamless integration between projects and finance.\u201d\nFor the Finance Director, Bizview comes with the benefit of giving better control over the entire organization, including all projects. With over 10,000 projects every year, it helps to have a solid planning and follow-up tool in place. With decentralized planning across a distributed workforce, the project managers are now in control of their own project planning, including budgeting.\n\u201cWhen I know that the project managers are in control of their projects, I can sleep well at night. We have better overview of the projects with challenges, so we can direct our focus toward them,\u201d Golmen continued.\nFor a large company with many users like Multiconsult, the flexibility to create any type of planning, budget, or report structure for a large user group across multiple projects has created tremendous value to the company through cost-savings, better insight, and faster time-to-value.\n\u201cBizview is user-friendly, simple and gives a good overview. Multiconsult has made a lot of savings by implementing Bizview,\u201d said Golmen.\nFuture plans include having 1300 project managers also using Bizview for reporting, and for gathering information and reporting the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on thousands of on-going projects based on the existing project reporting structure.\n"

        "content": "\nThe Challenge\n\n\n\n\nWith sixty-five different properties to manage, Stoltz Management relied on their Yardi ERP to capture all necessary data. And while the solution was great for gathering the data the organization needed, getting it back out again in a usable form for reporting was a different story. Standard report options didn\u2019t give the accounting team everything they needed, and designing custom reports was becoming both too time-consuming and too expensive.\n\u201cWe ended up stuck with the default reporting,\u201d recalled Erin Smurkowski, assistant controller for Stoltz Management. \u201cIf we wanted to change anything, we had to pay, and it could take weeks to get the report back. Even simple tasks like adding a column could take up to two weeks.\u201d\nAs the company expanded in 2017, they knew they had to change something in their process, and they chose Spreadsheet Server by insightsoftware to do it. Said Smurkowski, \u201cSpreadsheet Server could do everything we wanted and more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBuilding to Success with Spreadsheet Server\nFrom the start, Smurkowski could use Spreadsheet Server to make the reports the team couldn\u2019t build before, as well as replicate larger standard reporting packages. \u201cWe run asset management reports for 65 properties each month. Each property had fifteen reports which had to be manually run and exported before being copied and pasted into Excel. It would take four accountants at least five hours each to manually run all these reports,\u201d Smurkowski said. \u201cSo, the first thing I did was rebuild all those packages in Spreadsheet Server. Now I just go in and click a button and I can go do something else while those compile in the background.\u201d\nSpreadsheet Server also proved beneficial in developing an annual budget process. \u201cWe used to spend a lot of time exporting the prior year\u2019s data so managers could reference it to make the next year\u2019s budget,\u201d Smurkowski said. \u201cI was able to create budget packages for each property in Spreadsheet Server, then send them out using Spreadsheet Server\u2019s Distribution Manager tool.\u201d\nThe solution\u2019s flexibility has come into play several times for the Stoltz Management accounting team. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to create reports we never had before,\u201d Smurkowski said. \u201cOther departments needed reports in different formats, yet there was nothing that I couldn\u2019t create in Spreadsheet Server. The Query Designer wizard tool was intuitive and easy to work with; I was able to get everything built fairly quickly.\u201d\nThe team has also found creative ways to use Spreadsheet Server reporting on Yardi data beyond just financials and budget. \u201cNow we have specialized residential reports! We can run a report on our resident\u2019s vehicles in case we need to tow a car that doesn\u2019t belong at our residential properties. Now we can search license plates to see if a vehicle belongs to a resident or not. Before we couldn\u2019t even search for vehicles,\u201d Smurkowski said. \u201cWe also report on birthdays during the coming month so we can be sure to send residents birthday wishes. We can search any demographic we need. I may not even build a full report; sometimes all it takes is a quick query that I can send to a property manager.\u201d\nIn another instance, Spreadsheet Server\u2019s Query Designer was able to pull specific and necessary information that the team didn\u2019t even need to report on but could not surface otherwise from within Yardi. \u201cWe noticed a lease changed in our ERP, but didn\u2019t know who made the change when or why,\u201d said Smurkowski. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if the change was correct and if not, how long it had been an issue. But I could easily pull that information using Spreadsheet Server without creating a big report.\u201d\nNavigating Success\nSpreadsheet Server has changed Stoltz Management\u2019s month-end process for the better. \u201cI have a daily process that addresses any transactions from the previous days to make sure there\u2019s backup attached where necessary,\u201d said Smurkowski. \u201cWith Spreadsheet Server, I can automatically publish a report that identifies what\u2019s missing on a daily basis. This keeps everyone on track with where they should be.\u201d\nOther notable returns have included:\n\nReducing asset management report compilation for 65 properties from 20 hours to 5 hours\nAbility to create custom invoices using accurate data\nRemoving need for manual work and freeing senior accountants up for more productive tasks\n\n\u201cSpreadsheet Server has been incredibly useful to make all the reports we could never build on our own before,\u201d Smurkowski concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s been far and away the best choice.\u201d\n"

The group employs 400 people distributed across three factories in Norway and one in Sweden. Their 2019 revenue was 1.8bn NOK (approx. $173M USD). Previously, Grilstad was using the ERP system Axapta as a data source for financial reporting in Excel. Creating reports required lengthy and cumbersome manual processes. All departments in the company were involved in the financial reporting process, but it was difficult for individual users to create standard reports on their own. The company was about to implement Microsoft Dynamics AX and needed a solution to extract fast and accurate reports in a flexible manner.\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\nGrilstad chose to implement Bizview, which is now used for financial reporting across the entire company, including reporting for separate departments and aggregate reporting for the entire company, as well as operational reporting for the factories. Grilstad is running a standard cost-based calculation system for their own production. Additionally, data is fetched from the sales order system and combined with the delivery system to produce daily, weekly, and monthly reports for delivery precision. \nIn addition to financial reports for every part of the company, Bizview is used for production control and delivery precision control, as well as reports for delivery precision to their customers. Bizview collects data from the purchasing, warehouse, and production systems and consolidates this together with data from the financial ledgers to be able to analyse deviations in the production costs in detail for each production and each item number. \nBizview has been fully integrated with Microsoft Dynamics AX, and is now a key piece in the overall financial ecosystem of the company. Since implementing Bizview, Grilstad has enjoyed faster time to value with less time spent on generating reports. Now users can easily access and extract the report that they need, without relying on IT or external consultants.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Furthermore, there is a risk that the insurance providers could terminate the contract as a result of lack of internal control. Therefore, it is crucial to have full control over the reporting process.\nSolution\nThe NTHF began using BizView Reporting and Dashboard and added Budget and Forecasting in late 2019. The current solution has provided the organization with very satisfactory results.\nResults\nHans M. Kristiansen, Executive Director at NTHF, comments on the results of implementing BizView in the organization: \u201cThe direct impact in our daily work is represented by significant time savings of manual use of financial spreadsheet and reporting, and the fact that we at least have saved two positions handling finance and accounting.\u201d\u200b\nThanks to Bizview\u2019s modern technology and powerful visualization features, the NTHF also has experienced some unexpected benefits.\n\u201cIt is easy combine numbers and presentation of our book of business to all our business partners,\u201d Kristiansen continued. \u201cIt is quite impressive that we are considered as the most innovative player in our market by applying new and modern technology in our daily work to such an extent.

This will be the key to our success.\u201d\nAndersen added, \u201cBizview is extremely flexible, powerful, and intuitive. And when we look at the cost, Bizview is in a completely different class than other systems in the market.\u201d\n\u201cOur biggest challenge is dealing with large volumes of data from a variety of different systems, with users from around the world,\u201d Andersen continued. \u201cIt is also very important to be able to ensure fast and secure access to management information at all levels. With Bizview, we got a decentralized management, where responsibility is shifted to those who are directly involved. We are also experiencing faster access to information and shorter time used on producing financial reports. We spend significantly less time managing ongoing planning processes. An additional feature that is well received is that we can provide key customers direct access to viable information, something that simplifies life for everyone.\u201d\nBizview is extremely flexible, modular based, and works with most all business management systems in the market.\nEasier overview, easier life\nComplex systems are often difficult to manage: Too many standards, different databases, different locations, and different understanding of IT processes often result in companies not having updated information and/or control of parts or all of the business. This can create increased cost, but also contributes to errors on the production line or on service quality.\nImplementation of Bizview was faster than other systems OSM had implemented. And on the matter of implementation, Andersen added, \u201cWe can rightly say that \u2018time is money.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cBizview is developed so that even smaller companies and organizations should have a fair chance to have a state-of-the-art system with advanced capabilities,\u201d Andersen continued. \u201cPrice-wise, there\u2019s hardly any other solution that can match it. But equally important is that Bizview\u2019s structure and flexibility dramatically reduces the time of implementation.

Without a system to accurately calculate contributions and in need of a decentralized budget and forecast process, Dalakraft was only able to close its books once a year. So they turned to Bizview.\nSolution\nWith Bizview, the salesforce has access to well-structured sales statistics, which makes it easier to allocate resources and focus on the areas where they will have the biggest impact. The solution has also given Dalakraft much better overview of the business and a foundation to make better decisions. Dalakraft implemented their new performance management system\u2014a modern web-based solution with modules for forecasting, budget, reporting, analysis\u2014in 2012.

With 89 store managers who need to manually update budget templates in Excel using help materials, we typically used 2-3 work weeks or more.
