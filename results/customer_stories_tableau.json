        "title": "Marketing agency Tinuiti centralises data sources, scales marketing analytics",
        "company": "Tinuiti",
        "content": "Tinuiti, North America\u2019s largest independent performance and data-driven digital marketing agency with more than $1 billion in managed ad spend, develops strategic media plans for more than 500 clients. Brands such as Tommy Bahama, Eddie Bauer and Brooks Running rely on Tinuiti to combine channel data analytics and marketing science with an integrated media strategy. However, a complicated landscape of marketing technologies and data sources made it difficult for Tinuiti to quickly analyse information so that media is fully optimised for one-to-one client marketing. Tinuiti adopted Tableau, helping staff make sense of all channel-level data and reducing time spent on data reporting, collection, and preparation by 60 per cent. They centralised data from more than 100 sources with the help of ChannelMix by Alight Analytics and created a scalable, repeatable, cost-effective and automated reporting infrastructure through Tableau, which satisfies customer needs, increases staff and analytics effectiveness, and enhances client relationships. With the Tableau platform, including Tableau Prep, the Tinuiti analytics team quickly pulls data from a complex mix of digital channels and creates custom, flexible dashboards for customers so they see the full story of their brand efforts. They also deliver bespoke and templated reports so clients\u2019 marketing departments can self-explore data, investigate underlying details and make better decisions that improve brand engagement. Tableau connects to cloud-hosted marketing data in Amazon Redshift and provides high-performance, secure dashboards for both customers and Tinuiti teams so questions and needs are addressed immediately. In-turn, marketing budget is allocated to the best media tactics that create the strongest engagement. With so many marketing sources, Tinuiti was overwhelmed trying to ingest, clean, combine and provide actionable data reports to its customers. The agency used a painstaking manual process to pull and transform information, but struggled to put timely, dynamic marketing reports in customers\u2019 hands, which also increased the burden to analytics staff, resulting in over 156,000 hours spent on data reporting annually. Customers wanted near real-time analytics, and without it, marketing resources couldn\u2019t be directed at timely multi-channel tactics. Tinuiti adopted Tableau and found instant value with Tableau Prep. Tableau Prep cut the time Tinuiti spent cleaning, combining and shaping their data all while increasing capacity of the channel and analytics teams. Powered by APIs connected to Amazon Redshift that extract almost 600 GB of cloud-hosted marketing data, Tinuiti has created an automated reporting Prep flow that uses clean data from major marketing platforms for functions such as automated email attachments, social media and digital advertising. \u201cFor us to have access to a tool like Tableau Prep has given us the ability to go faster and do it at scale across multiple channels,\u201d explained Andrew Richardson. And now with Tableau Prep Conductor, the Tinuiti teams are able to schedule and manage self-service data preparation at scale, Andrew shared: \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to try it and expect it will help us automate and scale data prep across the company even more than we have today.\u201d They recognise it will speed up their ability to report on campaigns for clients, increasing the value provided, which also helps their bottom line. The new approach using a combination of ChannelMix and Tableau for automated, flexible, and scalable data analysis allows Tinuiti to deliver strategic value that nurtures strong, lasting client relationships. Clients such as Big 5 Sporting Goods recognise that having this comprehensive view of their channel marketing data greatly impacts their business and enables better spend of their marketing dollars. There\u2019s considerable nuance to marketing campaigns and data reporting. Each marketing tactic requires careful consideration and planning with varying KPIs and goals. Tinuiti understands that not every customer is analytically minded and data savvy, but it was also challenging with a smaller analytics staff to serve the different channel teams and easily answer customers\u2019 questions. Some of their complex questions included: what\u2019s the lifetime value of our customers, what segments should I go after, or how can I predictively forecast for the future when I\u2019m used to making decisions with gut feel? Tableau\u2019s drag-and-drop functionality and multiple data filters made it easier for Tinuiti\u2019s analytics team to accelerate work in areas that weren\u2019t possible before. With a vast number of e-commerce clients, Tinuiti created a flexible dashboard for them and its internal teams where anyone can adjust the profile, report name, type of chart, timeframes and other parameters to compare data; it\u2019s often available right after they start with Tinuiti. The analytics team also created a pacing report where channel teams monitor digital advertising budgets for brands so they can monitor daily spending rates and track over and under-spending. Even Tinuiti staff who weren\u2019t considered data experts are now clamouring to get Tableau and perform their own analysis instead of relying on the analytics team. And with all dashboards hosted in the cloud, always on and available 24/7, internal and client staff (including executives) can check on their digital marketing data whenever they choose. As Andrew explained, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have Tableau, we would be behind where we are today and need more staff to do the same amount of work.\u201d These consumable, dynamic dashboards are \u201cmaking a really big difference for us and our customers.\u201d Now, Tinuiti can focus more on telling the interesting stories behind clients\u2019 multi-channel data and deliver more value. The marketing landscape changes too quickly and both customers and the Tinuiti teams that serve them can\u2019t wait on quarterly updates to make better business decisions. \u201cWe ended up choosing Tableau because of the efficiency that we gained with dashboarding as well as what we were going to see in data exploration,\u201d said Andrew. In fact, generating analytics on the spot \u2013 both in preparation for and during client meetings \u2013 means Tinuiti can better collaborate with and influence clients by having one source of truth that\u2019s easy to understand and manage, and leads to better customer outcomes. Brooks Running, another Tinuiti customer, lauded how their use of Tableau creates business value for them: \"The Tinuiti team have gone above and beyond to create dashboards that are not only actionable but also beautiful by design! The analytics team have been a pleasure to work with throughout the process and even helped us learn and grow in our own Tableau knowledge. We very much appreciate their hard work and expertise as the dashboards have helped take our business to the next level.\u201d Tinuiti has a marketing science team that uses Tableau forecasting to perform predictive analytics for clients, looking out at least six months. When clients head into annual planning, the agency is prepared with a report showing the year ahead based on historical analysis. This can be applied to display, email marketing, paid social and search, and more. Eventually, Tinuiti has plans to build in predictive analytics at scale so forecasting is part of every client dashboard built. What-if analyses are another concentration for Tinuiti as they expand their capabilities. Leveraging the power of Tableau and integration with R has also allowed for better, time series analysis and media forecasting in conjunction with these what-if analyses. In Tableau, they can answer client questions like \u201cIf I had more money to give you, what would that look like?\u201d Plus, with past data reflected in the analytics, clients and Tinuiti staff have the option to compare actual sales with forecast sales and adjust results by changing new business growth and expected customer churn rates."

        "company": "Gulf Bank",
        "content": "Data literacy is delivering benefits to the Gulf Bank but also the wider society of Kuwait, where the bank operates from. As one of Kuwait's major lending banks, Gulf Bank has begun a data-focused modernisation. Whilst hackathons are ensuring its customers and citizens gain data literacy.  \"We have a vision that we want to be data-driven, and in order to be data-driven, we need everyone in the bank to be data literate,\" says Mai AlOwaish, Chief Data and Innovation Officer, Gulf Bank. She joined the bank in 2021 to form the data and innovation office, which is part of the bank's 2025 vision to be the leading bank in Kuwait.  AlOwaish says the data literacy vision is aimed at everyone at every level of the bank, from branch employees to the C-suite executives.  \"At the bank, we believe that data literacy is key for the digital transformation of Kuwait overall. We built our own data literacy programme here at the bank, and we have extended that to the community by performing the datathon,\" AlOwaish says of how the Gulf Bank saw that its own data journey could be beneficial to its nation and founded a nationwide hackathon. \"Datathon is a countrywide competition that includes training on Tableau and also the teaching of data concepts. This is one of several steps that we provide to our community with skills and challenges to help future generations achieve our sustainability goals and strengthen our economy,\" AlOwaish says.  \"We intend to run the datathon annually after the success of the first edition. We were so proud to see a diverse audience after the success of the first one, including a large number of youths and women,\" she says. One attendee, Laila Ali, says of attending the datathon: \"After doing the data workshop with the Gulf Bank team, I started to learn more. What I love about Tableau is that I am fascinated by human behaviour, and it helps you understand people by looking at trends.  \"Learning Tableau was not difficult; it is a very intuitive tool,\" she says. \"I think soon enough we will be asking for people with data analytics skills as a basic skill, just like we ask people if they can use a computer,\" AlOwaish says. This is why creating data literacy beyond the bank was important, and how these skills are becoming vital to society as well as financial services providers.  Internally, the Gulf Bank began developing its data literacy by initially focusing on the bank's business analysts and then rolling out data literacy across the entire bank. AlOwaish says now everybody in the bank knows their responsibilities and role towards data. \"We make sure that employees in all departments have the correct concepts on data and they have the correct tools,\" adds Fouzan Al Sumait, Gulf Bank Data Science Lead.  In the 12 months since the Gulf Bank introduced data literacy, the bank already sees business benefits. AlOwaish says self-service access to data is \"empowering our data and business analysts\" and reducing bottlenecks that previously existed as all the data demand was placed on the data science team.  \"Tableau helped us to centralise all our analytics into one place. So there is no more waiting for data; everyone is looking in the same place for insight,\" she says of how the Gulf Bank has achieved a single version of the truth.  AlOwaish and the Gulf Bank have delivered data literacy to their colleagues at a rapid pace, and in doing so, it has also extended the data literacy skills of its society. In just one year, the Bank of Gulf is seeing business benefits which improve the bank and prove the importance of data literacy."

        "title": "St George\u2019s Hospital uses Tableau to cut patient waiting times and optimise clinical care for millions in the UK",
        "company": "St. George's Hospital ",
        "content": "With over 9,000 dedicated staff caring for patients around the clock, St George\u2019s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in London is one of the largest healthcare providers in the UK. In addition to acute hospital services, it delivers a wide variety of specialist care to patients from around the country, as well as a full range of community services to a population of 1.3 million people in southwest London. St George\u2019s implemented Tableau as part of the NHS\u2019s ongoing digital transformation strategy, to deliver a better, more data driven approach to decision making for thousands of clinicians, nurses, admin and management staff every day. The result is higher quality, more efficient patient care, with staff able to self-serve many of their own analytics needs and keep hospital operations running smoothly around the clock. Every year, data becomes more and more important to St George\u2019s Hospital. As the NHS continues its journey towards digital transformation and paperless operations, the need for accurate, easily accessible digital patient records, reports, operational plans and more has never been higher. \u201cData is now the lifeblood that runs throughout the organisation, feeding every part of it.\u201d says Elizabeth White, CIO at St George\u2019s. \u201cOver time, the demand for information has become huge and with new tech comes new possibilities. AI, big data and visualisation are all having a significant impact on the way we operate day to day and the things we can achieve.\u201d Prior to Tableau, the hospital relied on a combination of spreadsheets and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for its data analytics and reporting needs. While this approach was adequate for some aspects of operations, the siloed nature of reports made it hard to get key information out to everyone who needed it, and the reports themselves weren\u2019t always easy to navigate or understand. \u201cWe knew we needed tools that could help with data sharing, presentation, output and understanding,\u201d explains Elizabeth. \u201cWe spent a lot of time and effort on the back-end, getting data into great shape, so the only thing missing was a flexible platform that we could use to bring data to the whole organisation, without any visual limitations.\u201d In 2013, St George\u2019s IT team did a full appraisal of the available solutions, and quickly identified Tableau as the best fit for their needs. \u201cTableau ticked a lot of boxes for us,\u201d says Rob Simpson, Deputy Head of Information at St George\u2019s. \u201cSpeed of development was a big thing, as was the flexibility to link to lots of different business sources and present them in a highly visual, easily digestible way. The ability to consolidate important information in one central location that\u2019s accessible to all proved a significant step forward on our data journey.\u201d Since implementation, Tableau usage has grown substantially throughout the hospital. There are now over 2,000 active unique users, consisting of clinicians, nurses, admin, management, and executive staff. \u201cA few years ago, most users wouldn\u2019t know where to look for data so they would just come to central informatics team, which turned it into a bottleneck for productivity,\u201d notes Preethi Satheyendra, Principal Information Analyst at St George\u2019s Hospital. \u201cNow they can easily find most of what they need directly in Tableau, saving time for everyone.\u201d The result is a flourishing self-service data culture throughout the organisation spanning both operational and clinical activities. \u201cTableau currently receives more than 240,000 hits a month from users self-serving their own analytics needs,\u201d adds Preethi. \u201cThe more our users see, the more they want too, meaning usage and engagement is growing steadily all the time.\u201d To cater for new users, regular drop in sessions are held, which also act as a forum for collaboration and exchanging ideas between existing users. Departments such as finance, HR, renal, procurement and pathology also have their own \u2018Tableau Champions\u2019, who look after specific departmental analytics and reporting needs. As usage of Tableau continues to grow, the informatics team has created a series of standardised dashboards and templates to help groups of users quickly find the information they need when they log into Tableau Server. \u201cA great example is our pharmacy dashboard, which gives the pharmacists everything they need to know in a quick glance,\u201d says Preethi. \u201cThe dashboard contains the latest data on in/outpatient prescriptions, drugs ordered over time, by whom, and on which wards, as well as the turnaround time between a drug being ordered and it arriving at the pharmacy.\u201d Another example is the \u2018Good Morning St George\u2019s\u2019 dashboard, which gives the executive management team key information about patient flow through the hospital, from the number of people in the waiting room, to the number of people who have been discharged in the last 24 hours. \u201cHaving such easy access to this kind of information means the executives can make informed decisions at all times, rather than making educated guesses based on data that could be days or even weeks out of date,\u201d adds Preethi. At the start of 2022, St George\u2019s Hospital became part of a wider group with nearby Epson Hospital and St Helier Hospital, significantly expanding the scope of data sharing and reporting taking place between the sites. \u201cNaturally, the new way of working presented a number of data challenges that we\u2019re still working through,\u201d notes Elizabeth. \u201cFortunately, tools like Tableau are making things a lot easier than they could otherwise have been, both from a sharing and governance perspective. We\u2019re also actively exploring how machine learning can help us to further streamline our analytics and reporting capabilities throughout the group going forward.\u201d \u201cUltimately, patient care is, and always will be, our number one priority,\u201d concludes Rob. \u201cBetter data quality results in better patient journeys, and Tableau is playing a big role in helping us achieve that.\u201d"

        "title": "NHS Digital Supports UK COVID- 19 Pandemic Response with Tableau and AWS",
        "company": "NHS Digital",
        "content": "This story was produced by our partner, AWS. The original version can be found here.  The open data and data visualisation team at NHS Digital was tasked to quickly gather, analyse, and share data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was used to inform rapid decision making and policy creation, and inform the public. Public facing data was aggregate and anonymous, with private and secure platforms used to deliver more sensitive data to NHS and care users that needed access to more granular information. NHS Digital needed backend infrastructure that could be scaled up to store and process large amounts of data, combined with front-end technology to manipulate it into a form that could be easily shared and understood. NHS Digital\u2014using Amazon Web Services (AWS), and working with data visualization provider Tableau\u2014was able to deliver the first crucial data dashboards in just 9 days. As the COVID-19 pandemic started to hit the UK, the open data and data visualization team at NHS Digital was tasked with quickly gathering and analysing the associated data and presenting it in a way that would help decision makers and assist with creating policy in response to the pandemic. With the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly evolving and escalating, the NHS Digital team had to quickly prioritise the data that would be collected, analysed, and presented to different stakeholders. It used AWS to store and process the data, with AWS Partner Tableau providing Modern Cloud Analytics to analyse and visualise the data and insights in the form of dashboards for the relevant stakeholders. The organization made this choice because it needed a backend infrastructure that could be scaled up to store and process the vast amount of data, integrated with front-end technology that could manipulate this data into a form that could be easily shared and understood. This was the first time NHS Digital had been commissioned to create a mass public dashboard. By using multiple providers, including Tableau and AWS, NHS Digital delivered the first of the crucial new dashboards in a few days. The project, as a whole, completely changed how the NHS can visualise data. Previously, visualizations were built using aggregate data. NHS Digital has now developed secure infrastructure that can host patient-level data in dashboards, enabling vaccine management dashboards and appointment-level information. This enables clinicians and general practitioners (GPs), who can now use smartcard authentication to access these dashboards, to make risk-based decisions, changing the way population health is managed. As these dashboards deal with the most sensitive patient-level data, the use of smartcards means they are also highly secure. Where data is non-patient level, NHS Mail with 2 factor authentication is used. \u201cThis ability to go from aggregate data, all the way down to patient level data in a secure way, while challenging, has been immensely transformational,\u201d says Alistair Bullward, head of analytical functions at NHS Digital. The NHS Digital team started its work by looking at the data of people reporting COVID-19 symptoms via the 111 website and call center, or via the 999 emergency services line. With mass testing not yet available, the data produced by these interactions was crucial in helping public health organizations and the government understand the symptoms of COVID-19. They could also use data to visualise how it was spreading across the UK, in order to identify potential hotspots to prepare the public health services in those areas. The NHS Digital team worked closely with Tableau and Goldman Sachs who provided the skills and resources to develop dashboards that analysed and visualised the data quickly and accurately. The rapid scaling of resources needed was supported using AWS. \u201cWe needed to get the data out for public access in a safe and anonymised form as soon as possible,\u201d says Bullward. \u201cWe then needed to make that data consumable so stakeholders could get insight into the questions they needed to ask.\u201d Soon after, the team was asked to produce a dashboard for high-risk individuals\u2014those whose medical conditions made them especially vulnerable to COVID-19\u2014who were asked to shield at home. This shielded patient list dashboard was used for central planning, such as making social care provisions and organizing for food parcels to be offered to shielding households. The data used was aggregated and anonymous and was published at a Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and national level on an open dashboard hub. A private version was also created to pilot functionality with users within the NHS. The Tableau team approached its senior management to secure the rapid provision of these services - taking 9 days from getting the infrastructure stood up to having the first dashboard go live.  The cloud-based infrastructure supported rapid decision making as new servers could be added almost instantly, making it easier to iterate and experiment. \u201cIn weeks we were going from nothing to having an enterprise solution for thousands of people a week and scaled to support something much, much bigger,\u201d says Bullward. In parallel, the NHS Digital team developed a range of dashboards for different stakeholders and groups. For example, directors of public health who needed to view data across England and its regions. These included dashboards for the shielded patients list, the NHS Pathways coronavirus triages (111 data), NHS Digital services dashboard, and the GP COVID-19 vaccine dashboard. Knowing the number of positive cases in different areas was important for public health operations, including the introduction of the tier system in autumn 2020, with legal restrictions around movement and social mixing varying depending on the level of risk in local areas. It was at this stage that the public-facing \u201ccoronavirus-in-your-area\u201d dashboard was launched, allowing users to type in their postcode to view local case rates. During the first 24 hours after going live, the online service received 120,000 visitors. The NHS Digital team remained hard at work during this time, launching a dashboard identifying people suitable for clinical trials for vaccines by the end of 2020. A university dashboard followed in January 2021 as students prepared to return. A key element to the project\u2019s success was a team spirit that developed as the different organizations worked together. Tableau and AWS regularly stepped in to help out. Established hierarchies across NHS Digital adapted to the situation. \u201cEveryone had a sense of purpose, it didn\u2019t matter who you worked for, it was about getting the job done,\u201d says Bullward, who found himself doing manual testing with an NHS director on Sunday evenings. \u201cWe just got on with it.\u201d The combination of the people, skills, expertise, and tooling helped the NHS Digital team overcome several challenges, such as the amount of traffic hitting the COVID \u201cin-your-area\u201d dashboard when it went live. The team used Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) service built for high performance, security, and developer convenience, to stop any issues occurring. The capabilities NHS Digital developed during the pandemic now provide the means for real population health management as never done before. As a result, NHS Digital aims to launch new capabilities more quickly by starting with a minimum viable product. \u201cI think a lot of people who were involved in the project now look back and think \u2018Oh, that was wonderful, we need to keep that up as much as we can\u2019,\u201d says Bullward. The team has since supported the UK\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine programme, including the vaccination roll out. Providing patient-level dashboards to people making decisions is a key focus. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s the future,\" says Bullward. \"It\u2019s about being able to go from high-level stuff and then going to that patient-level stuff so public health professionals can do what they need to do to improve lives.\u201d "

        "title": "Staysure uses Tableau Cloud to break down stubborn data silos and transform business decision making processes",
        "company": "Staysure",
        "content": "Staysure Group is the UK\u2019s number one travel insurance provider. The company was originally founded in 2004 by entrepreneur Ryan Howsam, to ensure over-50s could access travel insurance that covered pre-existing medical conditions. Since then, it has gone from strength to strength, significantly expanding its insurance offerings and providing peace of mind to more than eight million customers around the country. Over the last 12 months, Staysure has used Tableau to transform itself into a fully data driven company, breaking down data silos and creating a powerful new culture where employees at all levels of the business can self-serve their own analytics needs. Staysure has also used Tableau analytics to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on its business and inform key decisions during this critical time for the travel industry. Insurance is a highly data driven industry, with millions of policies bought and sold every day based on detailed analytical insights. However, as insurance companies grow and expand, their own internal data structures can be hard to maintain, resulting in disparate data environments that impact overall business efficiency. When Matt Cullen joined Staysure as Head of Business Insight in January 2021, this was exactly the situation he faced. \u201cI came into an environment with lots of spreadsheets and manual data reporting, and no overarching structure or governance\u201d said Matt. \u201cRapid growth, combined with multiple acquisitions, had created fragmented data silos all over the business, making it hard for employees to quickly find the information or intelligence they needed.\u201d With Tableau in place, employees now have a single unified platform through which they can work and collaborate, creating a much higher level of trust in data and reducing conflict between different departments. \u201cIn the past, people would come into meetings with their own siloed versions of the same data, for example on quote and sale volumes,\u201d explains Matt. \u201cOften, there would be small discrepancies between the numbers caused by different definitions or filters, which quickly led to issues. Now, everyone logs into Tableau Cloud and the latest data is always there for them to see.\u201d Tableau\u2019s user-friendly interface has also significantly increased the amount of self-service analytics taking place throughout the company. \u201cTableau makes it incredibly easy to create attractive and engaging visuals that are simple to understand, regardless of an individual\u2019s own level of analytics experience,\u201d says Matt. \u201cAs a consequence, people are much more willing to start exploring data themselves.\u201d Doing so has helped eliminate numerous bottlenecks to productivity, improving decision making and speeding up time to insight in the process. \u201cPreviously, many employees would wait for someone in the finance or central insights team to do all their analytics for them, says Matt. \u201cNow we have 35 Tableau creators and explorers in all departments of the business, as well as over 100 viewers, making detailed analytics faster, smoother and more enjoyable for everyone.\u201d Some of Staysure\u2019s most avid Tableau users are its executives, which Matt believes is a key factor in the growing data culture at the company. One particularly popular executive dashboard offers near real-time updates on top line KPIs, including the number of policies sold that day and the total revenue created across all the company\u2019s key brands, including Staysure, Avanti, and Petsure. \u201cHaving real-time trading information available in Tableau is really valuable; it helps me, and my executive colleagues, identify issues as soon as they emerge and make quicker, more efficient decisions,\u201d says Chris Sugden, CFO, Staysure Group. In addition to the insights provided, Tableau\u2019s extensive automation features have also significantly streamlined reporting throughout the company, ensuring everyone has the latest information at their fingertips. \u201cTableau gives us the ability to schedule flows overnight,\u201d explains Matt. \u201cPreviously, we would have to run them manually every morning at 9am and they took an hour to complete, meaning no one had access to the latest data until 10am at the earliest.\u201d Now, the company uses Tableau\u2019s Data Management Add-on to run the flows automatically every night, which means hundreds of worksheets are refreshed in Tableau Cloud by 5am each day. \u201cI used to lie awake worrying about how to speed up the daily flows, but now I know they will be there every morning when I arrive at the office, which is a big weight off my mind,\u201d says Matt. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a huge amount of uncertainty throughout the travel industry, making it very hard to effectively plan ahead by more than a few weeks. However, Staysure has been able to use Tableau analytics to take much of the guesswork out of decision making at this difficult time. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of open-source data out there about COVID-19 and the impact it\u2019s having around the world,\u201d explains Matt. \u201cBy plugging this information into Tableau, we\u2019ve been able to understand, and even predict, changes to things like the foreign travel traffic light list. Doing so means we can amend our own plans and communications much faster than would otherwise have been possible, putting us in a position to help customers as soon as enquiries start coming in.\u201d"

        "title": "Kramp: Thanks to company-wide visual analytics, an essential step towards digital transformation has been taken",
        "company": "Kramp",
        "content": "Kramp Group is the largest supplier of parts and accessories for the agricultural industry throughout Europe. With more than 500,000 products available online, 11 distribution centers, and 24 stores across Europe, Kramp is the most reliable partner for customers and suppliers within the agricultural sector. Kramp Group was founded in 1951, with its headquarters are located in Varsseveld (The Netherlands). Over the past five years, Kramp has gone through a very successful digital transformation. With Tableau\u2019s visual analytics platform, the company has been able to adopt a data-driven approach in all areas. Kramp currently has over 3,000 employees, 1,200 of which are active Tableau users, checking the Tableau dashboard around 112,000 times per month. Thanks to this novel working approach, Kramp has weathered the storm of the coronavirus crisis and, in 2020. achieved a record turnover for \u20ac953 million. Kramp Manager Digital Intelligence Ewoud van Dijk gives a great example of this new data-driven approach. \u201cTableau played a key role in the implementation of our pricing strategy, which ultimately had a significant impact on our results. Managing prices for over 500,000 products per country requires a clear strategy and a data-driven approach. To ensure that Kramp is able to offer competitive prices, thereby enabling volume growth and maintaining prices for our large assortment of products, visualizing price-related data is of great importance. All this data is displayed in Tableau, helping pricing managers in their ongoing search for opportunities to improve our prices. Different pricing scenarios can be calculated and visualized so that the right decisions can be made. In addition, sales results are analyzed in Tableau, discovering new opportunities and taking subsequent action.\u201d Ewoud: \u201cAt Kramp, while we primarily focus on the customer, we also focus on scalability and efficiency. With the most important processes are displayed in Tableau, our \u201cContinuous Improvement Program\u201d staff identify which processes can be improved in terms of efficiency and scalability. A good example of this is the \u201corder to delivery\u201d process. This is one of the first processes that we made visually transparent. For example, insight into \u201con time delivery\u201d is highly valuable for the organization. Armed with such data and its visual representations, Kramp is able to focus its efforts in the right areas to further improve the process.\u201d Five years ago, Kramp\u2019s turnover figures were only available via an outdated BI (business intelligence) tool, which mainly displayed data using plain tables. From a visual standpoint, this was not very engaging at all. BI was entirely under the IT department, while business self-service options were non-existent. At that time, Remko Schepers joined Kramp as Senior Business Controller in charge of the Sales & Marketing department. Remko asked his colleague Ewoud how he could make the data more transparent. Ewoud: \u201cI showed Remko my Excel sheets. I was not happy with them at all, but it was all I had. At that point, the colossal amount of data I had could no longer even fit within my Excel sheets.\u201d That conversation was the start of Kramp\u2019s digital transformation in the field of BI, which later expanded into the field of data and analytics. Remko is now the Manager Business Control Development in charge of further developing analytical insights and data-driven financial forecasting. Remko: \u201cAt first, it was just five early ambassadors participating in this endeavor. Very soon, we realized the limitations of what the five of us could do. If we wanted to succeed, we needed a plan to expand. So, together with the business owners in Finance and Technology, we developed a project plan. To carry it out, we had to reach out to the board members and get their approval. Eventually, the Executive Board approved our plan. We had to agree on specific BI governance, whereby each Board domain had to be self-sufficient to some extent and be able to claim some of the central BI team\u2019s development capacity.\u201d Remko considered that introducing self-service was very important, since it would become a necessary step towards implementing visual analytics and consequently making that large amount of data accessible. And with that, they would be able to develop accurate and effective dashboards themselves, with which they could then create actionable insights. \u201cFor Ewoud and I, it was clear from the start that, to make the project a success, we needed to get the whole organization on board. We wanted to develop a company-wide data-driven mindset. With a decentralized approach to BI, strong involvement from all departments, and a lot of freedom for users to visualize their own data, we were able to establish the desired data-driven mindset.\u201d \u201cOur philosophy at the start was to limit the number of Tableau licenses to about 30, distributed across all business departments. The point was to ensure that the licenses would be properly utilized. In the process, we also drafted a guideline for managers to determine whether someone was eligible for a license. The greatest freedom given to the business was to be able to connect with several often-unstructured data sources. This went straight against IT etiquette\u201d says Remko. \u201cMany companies tend to keep everything inaccessible. I still believe that making it available for everyone was the right thing to do. It helped speed up the development of insights and, at the same time, set up a robust data warehouse, which usually takes considerably more time. Later, however, we did have to centralize control somewhat further. That was Ewoud\u2019s decision. The philosophy of local and decentralized management in charge of each department with the use of Tableau was maintained, but we introduced an overall management system to keep everything organized and under control.\u201d Remko: \u201cIn the fall of 2016, after we had laid the foundation for the data warehouse with Teradata, we settled upon a tool for data visualization. Representatives from all relevant departments were involved in the selection process, as we were looking for a tool that could fit every area as best as possible. We collectively opted for Tableau. The deciding factor was the fact that Tableau is set up very intuitively. There is also the fact that Tableau has a very large community of users in the market that is always sharing its experience for best practices.\u201d Ewoud: \u201cIn the first year, which was very hectic, Infotopics from Oldenzaal helped us with the foundation, the installation of the server, the access rights based on roles and groups, and many more related aspects. Then, we distributed the licenses, and the analysts were trained and assisted by Infotopics in creating the first dashboards. It became evident that this new tool would be adopted very quickly. Infotopics\u2019 goal is to help their customers fully get into the swing of things, and Kramp\u2019s goal back then was to achieve self-sufficiency. That is why our partnership with Infotopics worked so wonderfully. Now we are able to handle things ourselves in most areas, while Infotopics still jumps in and helps us with complex issues or when we need an extra pair of hands.\u201d Remko: \u201c2020 was a very special year for Kramp. When the Coronavirus crisis hit, we devised scenarios and worked out how we would weather potential setbacks. In the end, the opposite turned out to be true: our sales actually increased substantially. However, it is important to point out that we immediately took adequate measures, both logistically and within the workspace. The logistics service was able to continue as usual and remote work was quickly implemented by means of applications such as Tableau. Moreover, the digital transformation we had already kick-started added more functionality to our E-Commerce platform. This also proved to be very beneficial. I think 2020 is proof that digital transformation is the right way to go.\u201d\nEwoud: \u201cTableau was very helpful during the COVID-19 crisis as it allowed everyone to access all the important insights from their homes. That way they were always aware of what was going on.\u201d Ewoud: \u201cIn recent years, Kramp has mainly focused on extracting and using data insights. For this purpose, Tableau has been a great asset. Currently, we know that there are more opportunities to make our analytics even more actionable. We are now seeing more and more initiatives to use data science, forecasting, and analytics in our business processes. You do not become data-driven overnight.\u201d Remko: \u201cThe chosen decentralized approach has created many new KPIs and insights. However, it has become increasingly necessary to submit these findings to the country management and the board in a standardized and centralized way. Many managers still view Tableau as a maze of dashboards. Within Finance, we have started a project to create an \u201cIntegrated Country Performance Dashboard\u201d with Tableau. The process entails retrieving all KPI data from the business domains that use the click-through functionality and displaying them on the dashboards. We also created a KPI handbook with definitions and responsibilities, along with a collaborative platform within an app that was specifically developed for this purpose. We see the KPI framework as an integral part of sustaining good business practices. As such, we are able to cleverly combine the centralized data and set up driver-based forecast models to advance to the next stage of data-driven methodologies for continuous financial planning within Kramp. This is yet another instance where Tableau will play an important role by making the insights accessible.\u201d"

        "content": "Money transactions are a matter of trust. And because personal contact and communication with the financial institution are particularly important in this regard, VR-Bank Mitte eG conspicuously presents itself as the \u201cMitmachbank\u201d (the bank to join in). With a balance sheet total of about \u20ac2.5 billion, the company serves individuals and businesses from an area of considerable size, consisting of the districts of Eichsfeld, Northeim, G\u00f6ttingen and Werra-Mei\u00dfner. VR-Bank Mitte eG counts around 430 full-time and part-time employees and maintains relationships with clients and members via virtually all conventional and digital channels, from its network of 30 branches to a phone and online branch, to mobile apps and presences in the social networks, to a regular podcast. \u201cBecause our relationships with customers, members and employees are of great importance to us, we regularly ask them for detailed feedback regarding perception of our brand, our contact and consulting quality, assessment of price-performance ratio, evaluation of our processes, and general satisfaction\u201d, explains Benedikt Lares, Head of Sales Management, VR-Bank Mitte eG. \u201cTo this end we provide a structured, multi-page online questionnaire on our website, which our visitors may use for feedback, spontaneously or after being prompted, for example by mail or after a consultation conversation. We wanted to automate and professionalise the analysis of these assessments. After an in-depth analysis of the market, we went with Tableau. Tableau reliably accompanied the decision-making process and was always on our side with advice and support. This solution enables employees to quickly analyse data from various sources even without prior technological knowledge.\u201d In the meantime, the company has installed its own Tableau server. Three colleagues take care of server administration as well as creation of analyses and dashboards that around 35 managers access regularly. \u201cWe\u2019ve enrolled our dashboard developers in the Tableau Academy meanwhile, to enable them to make maximum use of the solution. But for me the most impressive aspect was that, right from the beginning, they\u2019ve created amazing analyses with Tableau, just after watching some YouTube videos and without further support.\u201d Meanwhile the company has analysed close to 2,000 pieces of client feedback with Tableau. \u201cWe saved enormous amounts of evaluation time \u2013 60 to 70%,\u201d reports Benedikt Lares. \u201cThe interactive dashboards are updated weekly. Now we have access to the current numbers anywhere and at any time, for example in meetings and on the move from the iPad. Using filters and drill-downs, you can set the desired parameters quickly, if need be down to an individual evaluation.\u201d Even though the new solution has only been deployed since mid-2020, the acceptance among leadership is high. Additionally, the feedback analysis is distributed quarterly to all employees as a condensed fact sheet. The predominantly positive customer feedback made the workforce feel empowered and increased their loyalty to their employer. \u201cAnalysis of customer feedback allows evocative insights, for example in the valuation of our brand, our consulting quality, or our price-performance ratio in different age groups and regions,\u201d explains Florian Hartleib, Regional Manager of Company Communication, VR-Bank Mitte eG. \u201cWe have, for example, noticed that our performance has often been rated higher directly after a consultation. And the ratio of referrals rose as well. We were able to take countermeasures when shortcomings were noticed, using appropriate means of communication or offers, and were able to improve customer retention continuously.\u201d All in all VR-Bank Mitte eG sees itself to be still at the beginning of its customer analyses. \u201cWe first wanted to establish a baseline of our external image to subsequently build on,\u201d reports Florian Hartleib. \u201cThe results are encouraging. In the future, we can imagine defining certain feedback metrics as binding service levels.\u201d Meanwhile VR-Bank Mitte eG is conducting employee surveys in a similar manner and regularly collects status reports from leadership for an overview of the internal situation. Benedikt Lares says: \u201cPerceived shortcomings, for example regarding the furnishing of hardware and software in the workplace, are immediately visible in the illustrations by way of traffic light colours.\u201d Besides ongoing feedback analysis, VR-Bank Mitte eG uses Tableau for a whole range of other applications, such as analysing members, investigating usage of its online channels and ATMs, and evaluating sales results. Additional dashboards, for example to visualise credit processes, are soon to be completed or in the planning stage. Benedikt Lares explains in conclusion: \u201cWe are involving future users in the development of new dashboards to achieve high acceptance right from the start. And we are already noticing a kind of culture change. Colleagues aren\u2019t put off from surveys or evaluations any longer, since the daily interaction with data has, thanks to Tableau, become much more simple and intuitive than in the past. The future certainly harbours even more possibilities.\u201d"

        "company": "Experian",
        "content": "Experian is the world's leading global information services company, with operations in 37 countries around the world. Originally founded in 1996, it employs over 17,000 staff and generates annual revenues in excess of $5 billion (FY2020). Here, Sarah Robertson, Product Director at Experian, discusses Tableau\u2019s pivotal role in the company\u2019s new Experian Safeguard dashboard, a powerful analytics tool that helps public organisations use demographic data to pinpoint and protect vulnerable communities from COVID-19. What is Experian Safeguard? Experian Safeguard combines open-source data with Experian\u2019s own proprietary ConsumerView data files and presents it at the local authority level via a fully customisable Tableau dashboard. The tool is free to use for public organisations and gives them fast access to key insights about their local communities. This could help, for example, to pinpoint areas where there\u2019s a high concentration of people over 70 and/or living alone, as well as those with low household incomes. By analysing where these different factors converge, organisations can quickly identify vulnerable areas that likely require extra care and support. Why did you choose Tableau for this project? Thanks to our existing relationship with Tableau in both the UK and US, where Tableau forms part of our Ascend Analytical Sandbox, we knew that Tableau's deep analytics and high-quality visualisation capabilities made it a great fit for the project. Firstly, we wanted Experian Safeguard to be accessible to a wide range of organisations, which meant a Tableau Server solution worked extremely well. Secondly, we wanted it to be easy to pick up and use without the need for training, and Tableau\u2019s intuitive user interface allows people to do exactly that. Finally, we wanted it to be fully scalable, which we could achieve very easily by deploying Tableau in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. Another key factor was speed to market. Unlike many products and solutions, which go through multiple concepts and test stages, we wanted to make Experian Safeguard available as quickly as possible, so we needed to use tools that allowed us to do that. Tableau\u2019s ease of use, combined with a wealth of pre-existing internal development knowledge, meant we were able to take Experian Safeguard from concept to deployment in just two weeks. How many organisations are using the dashboard at present? We currently have around 70 public organisations using it to identify and care for at-risk members of their communities. The dashboard is free to use on a \u2018data for good\u2019 basis, meaning it\u2019s not open to commercial users like supermarkets, but is widely available to local authorities, NHS Trusts, emergency services and charities. One example is the Trussell Trust, which is using Tableau heat maps to help establish the best locations for new food banks, and where they will reach the highest number of people. How important do you think data has been during the COVID-19 pandemic? As a data person, it\u2019s been incredibly interesting to see how the UK government has used it to effectively communicate with the population as a whole. Dashboards and visualisations showing demographics overlaid with COVID cases and deaths have played an increasingly central role in keeping the public informed as the pandemic evolves. Data will likely be even more important in the aftermath, as we try to gain a better understanding of what happened and how we can avoid something similar in future. Many people are already saying that data is the new gold or the new oil, and this will only be more true as time goes by. What are your future plans for Tableau within Experian UK? We already use Tableau for client deliveries and are always looking to extend our use of technology to deliver the best for our clients. Data visualisation and storytelling go hand in hand, helping people to spot trends quickly and understand what they mean. As such, the use of powerful visualisation technologies like Tableau will undoubtedly play a big role in our future."

        "content": "As the largest financial institution in Indonesia, Bank Mandiri is committed to being attentive, proactive and innovative in providing the best solutions to its customers. This commitment is strongly seen as Bank Mandiri implements a culture of data optimisation, where each decision of every department will be made using data analytics. The bank\u2019s partnership with Tableau supports this by helping to improve data analytics skills among employees and by making data more accessible. The partnership has so far proved beneficial, as Bank Mandiri\u2018s Enterprise Data Management (EDM) Group collaborates with Tableau to lead the development of the bank\u2019s analytics capability. This group has successfully accelerated the dissemination of information from two weeks to two days in some cases and is defining new standards for data quality, governance and accessibility. In the past, information requests were sent to headquarters which needed two weeks to run an SQL query and gather information from different systems. They then prepared a report in spreadsheet format and sent this out by email. Bank Mandiri, however, wanted a faster and easier way to analyse information and to provide more secure access to those who need it. The EDM Group is helping to deliver this and is now able to provide requested information in a more timely manner. What\u2019s more, the information provided is not just a plain and as requested report but comes with thorough and up-to-date insights to helps make better and faster decisions. The bank is strictly supervised by the financial regulators to guarantee customers\u2019 information privacy, and this privacy is always prioritised and protected. The partnership with Tableau contributes to privacy by creating data governance. To support this, the bank is also planning to launch a new data governance unit as well as a data committee. The EDM Group has worked with Tableau to develop more than 600 dashboards and visualisations. One of these is a dashboard for monitoring debtors daily transactions, as well as supporting better decision making on new and renewal loan disbursement. Another dashboard is used to show customer behaviour and transaction characteristics, helping the bank to make analysis on the success of marketing campaigns and to determine the best strategy for future ones. A third dashboard is used to provide descriptive analytics to inform cross-selling recommendations. The EDM Group has also increased the speed of responding to ad-hoc requests and is able to provide various groups with secure access to visualisations in Tableau rather than sending data out in spreadsheets. The group is now expanding on these projects with an increased focus on embedding its data to all groups of the bank, including Distribution Strategy which supervises branch networks across the country. \u201cEvery decision we take must be based on data, whether those decisions are made at a C-level or within a branch. It is also important that everyone has access to the same data so that there will be no dispute about the facts. This is what we are currently working on,\u201d Setiawan added. Within the EDM Group, there are at least four roles required for data and analytics: a data engineer, a data governance officer, a business analyst and a data scientist. There are development plans for each role and they will have access to the curriculum from Mandiri University. As this team grows, they will lead user groups and empower others across the bank to become more data-driven. As an example, the EDM Group has started to enable non-EDM users with data analytics capability by organizing data & analytics course programmes. The programmes have been running since January 2020 and include participants from various divisions who can gain fundamental knowledge about data and learn how to produce visual analytics by using Tableau. To engage the participants, the EDM Group has created a community called Mandiri Tableau User Group (MTUG) which meets monthly and also provides coaching for Tableau users who have problems with data, analytics and visualisation. The coaches are volunteers from the EDM Group who can show their colleagues how to prepare future analysis and visualisation reports. Angga Pratama from Consumer Credit Risk and Analytics is one of the 571 employees using Tableau and said, \u201cBy creating good visualisations through Tableau, management can easily produce good analysis as well, helping the bank to make better decisions.\u201d"

        "company": "Kantonspolizei Aargau",
        "content": "Aargau Cantonal Police is a criminal, traffic and security police agency with a force of about 640 officers and 100 civil employees responsible for firm enforcement of the rule of law in the Swiss canton of Aargau. In the Situation and Analysis Centre of the Central Department for Command & Deployment, Crime Analyst Angelo Somaini sets out to improve the usability of relevant recorded data for all colleagues in the canton's police system and to implement comprehensive geocoded reporting for various purposes. Once Tableau came to the attention of Somaini, he and his team created interactive dashboards based on maps which colleagues from the entire canton could use to get a quick picture of the situation in their region, and analyse all historical incidents from 1 January 2014 onwards to investigate serial offences and to optimise regional planning for operations of motorised patrols. These new Tableau analyses empower Aargau Cantonal Police to move into the areas of predictive policing and real-time policing. In the Aargau Cantonal Police\u2019s police system, all relevant incidents in the canton will be recorded with plenty of detailed data and features, such as the type of offence, the time, the address, the involved individuals, the tools and weapons used, and the amount of damage. The digital records go back to 1 January 2014, and serve both ongoing investigations and police reporting. Using this system at roll call, all police forces receive complete information about recent incidents in their operational area. \u201cUnfortunately, reports from the police system are rather tabular and not particularly well structured,\u201d comments Angelo Somaini, crime analyst in Aargau Cantonal Police's Situation and Analysis Centre of the Central Department for Command & Deployment. In the past, police reporting mainly consisted of Excel tables which were exported from the police system, edited manually, embedded in PowerPoint presentations and then sent out. It took a lot of manual effort to create maps which showed the locations of reported incidents. \u201cI was made aware of this visualisation solution when I spoke to interns from the University of Lausanne who knew Tableau from their coursework,\u201d says Angelo Somaini. \u201cOur department purchased a Tableau desktop licence, and during a quiet spell of work, I was able to develop the first Tableau Dashboards with geocoded representations of incidents from the police system.\u201d Today, thanks to Tableau, all incidents since the beginning of 2014 can be viewed and analysed. \u201cTwice a day we import the current data from the police system, which enables us to create mostly current situational reports at any time,\u201d explains Angelo Somaini. \u201cOur colleagues can use filters to choose which region, type of incident, days and times, etc. they want to view, and will immediately receive the desired status report.\u201d Within a short period of time, the new Tableau Dashboards turned into the central information tool for the whole Aargau Cantonal Police. \u201cEven our police commander states that he relies on our analyses to get a quick overview on a daily basis.\u201d And even general police reporting has been considerably simplified and improved upon with Tableau. \u201cOn the one hand, the number of report requests from our regional offices has declined abruptly, because the new tool empowers them to cover their own data needs on-site,\u201d explains Angelo Somaini. \u201cOn the other hand, we receive many requests from colleagues to create reports on particular topics, for example, developments on burglaries or traffic offences in different areas and the time scale. Even there, Tableau makes our work much easier and we were able to improve the quality of the analyses.\u201d Unfortunately, even though Tableau saves a lot of work, it did not lead to a reduction of the workload in the Situation and Analysis Centre. On the contrary: \u201cThe new options have led to an enormous increase in information requirements. Therefore, in the meantime, 11 members of our team have a Tableau desktop licence to cope with the whole load.\u201d Marking of certain addresses, streets or areas in a Tableau Dashboard which, for example, show regular traffic offences or domestic violence at certain times of the night or day, enables the operational forces to see immediately, when and where the focus areas are. \u201cThese insights make it a lot easier to determine the most efficient areas of operation for police units on patrol,\u201d explains Angelo Somaini. \u201cThis means that the police force is on location quicker when things happen and are often able to prevent escalation.\u201d With the application of Tableau, the Aargau Cantonal Police has seen an improvement in data-based decision making in particular . Angelo Somaini reports: \u201cIn the past police, officers often had to rely on intuition in investigations. For example, when they had a suspicion that the number of burglaries had risen in a certain neighbourhood and they then intended to deploy more patrols there. Today, a Dashboard analysis is enough to assess the real development of different offences in certain regions within minutes, and to focus on the most pressing sectors.\u201d Tableau proves exceedingly useful even when investigating serial crimes and prognoses of possible future crimes. \u201cThe interactive Dashboards allow us to narrow in on similar crimes through filters and to ascribe them to the same group of suspects, for example, in cases when the method or tools used by the perpetrators are similar in a region or time frame,\u201d explains Angelo Somaini. \u201cThis enables us to identify serial offenders more easily and to make possible conclusions about typical areas of operations, or the date and time of the offence to make a probable prognosis of future offences so that we are better prepared. In this way, Tableau enables us to enter the era of predictive policing.\u201d The more insights Tableau analyses deliver for Aargau Cantonal Police, the bigger the demand gets. \u201cOur focus is clearly geocoding. It immediately shows connections which may not be revealed otherwise,\u201d reports Angelo Somaini. \u201cFor the future, I wish we had even better maps, and the option to show or hide more layers, as desired.\u201d In the future, Angelo Somaini\u2019s speculates that Tableau will be integrated more in active investigations. For example, it is probable that data sources will be added to receive more clues about perpetrators more quickly. \u201cImagine that rapists, thieves or bank robbers pass existing surveillance cameras on their escape route. If we could layer their respective positions and recording angles on a complete map of all existing cameras, we\u2019d have a good chance to very quickly receive usable picture data of persons and vehicles and use those for the manhunt. But there sure still is a long way to go for genuine real-time policing\u2026\u201d"

Its 50,000 colleagues in 120 countries drive results for clients by using proprietary data and analytics to deliver insights that reduce risk and improve performance.\nAon\u2019s Centre for Innovation and Analytics (ACIA) \u2013 part of the firm\u2019s Data & Analytic Services team \u2013 began using Tableau in 2014 to bolster analytical capabilities throughout the company. The goal was to cut time to insight and enable employees all over the world to better serve their own analytical needs. Today, Tableau is powering a number of Aon\u2019s flagship platforms including the Risk/View, an embedded data analytics service that brings thousands of people closer to their data. Aon thrives on its ability to deliver fast, accurate data analytics to colleagues and clients alike, enabling people to make better decisions and improve business. As part of this, Aon founded the ACIA in 2009, with a focus on improving data management, reporting and analytics throughout the company. However, the analytics tools in place at that time were not able to deliver the kind of high-quality insights the ACIA wanted, in the timescale required. \u201cWe were relying on a patchwork of tools including SQL, Chronos, BBA and Excel,\u201d states Giuseppe Tortorici, BI and Visualisation Manager at Aon\u2019s ACIA. \u201cWhile all of these were perfectly capable, they took a lot of skill and time to work with, plus they lacked the visual analytics aspects we were looking for.\u201d In 2014, Aon replaced its disparate analytics tools with Tableau, meaning that for the first time ever, ACIA analysts could work from one central analytics platform. It wasn\u2019t long before the ACIA saw an impact. \u201cStraight away we were able to combine insights much better and use visualisations to bring data to life,\u201d says Giuseppe. \u201cTableau\u2019s intuitive drag and drop interface also made analytics much faster, significantly cutting time to insight. New visualisations could be created from scratch in a matter of minutes, while creating full dashboards took just a day.\u201d Tableau\u2019s ease of use and rich visual analytics capabilities quickly sparked curiosity beyond the ACIA team, to the wider company. \u201cWe had an increasing number of business units coming to us, asking how they could use Tableau for their own analytics needs,\u201d adds Giuseppe. \u201cRecognising the potential, we began running Tableau training sessions and within a short period of time, had built a passionate Tableau community inside Aon.\u201d Giuseppe now mentors and assists Aon business units all over the world with their own Tableau training, creating comprehensive best practice guides they can use to organically drive uptake throughout the company. \u201cAll new dashboards are shared and peer-reviewed by the community before going to publication, which keeps the standard really high,\u201d says Giuseppe. \u201cThe level of interest in analytics has never been stronger, even for a company that revolves around data.\u201d In 2015, Aon chose Tableau to power its flagship Risk/View embedded portal, which provides thousands of insurance professionals with data-driven insights that help them accurately assess prospective customers. After a successful trial in Australia in 2016, Risk/View was rolled out across Canada, North America and the EMEA region. \u201c90 percent of the content published in Risk/View is created in Tableau,\u201d says Giuseppe. \u201cWith just a handful of dashboards we can give colleagues and carriers all the information they need to the make fast, informed decisions.\u201d A major factor in the choice to use Tableau was its intuitive user interface (UI). \u201cNew analysts can be trained very easily, which is important,\u201d notes Giuseppe. \u201cMany of them comment that Tableau is easy to pick up and learn, but also goes extremely deep where necessary, which they love.\u201d Development and delivery times are also very short, meaning information in Risk/View is always up to date; a key requirement for accurate decision making. Aon uses Alteryx to prep a wide range of systematic and non-systematic data sources before visualising everything in Tableau. Alteryx has also been used to automate many manual analytics processes, cutting down on repetition and saving time. \u201cWith Tableau and Alteryx, we can develop new content in a fraction of the time it would take in something like JavaScript,\u201d comments Giuseppe. \u201cIn many cases, the process has gone from weeks to hours, meaning anyone looking in Risk/View knows they can always trust the data they\u2019re looking at.\u201d Tableau\u2019s embedded analytics functionality also helps maintain consistency across all of Risk/View, as well as other externally facing portals. \u201cWhen dashboards are in production, a link is created to Tableau Server, which embeds them to both colleagues and carriers via Aon\u2019s portal,\u201d says Giuseppe. \u201cThis creates a very professional look and feel across all of our materials and content.\u201d \u201cWe have internal guidelines governing key areas like fonts and colour palettes and have also created a number of templates within Tableau, which helps ensure consistency,\u201d continues Giuseppe. \u201cMany of our external stakeholders don\u2019t even realise they are using Tableau!\u201d"

        "company": "Swiss Life ",
        "content": "With operations in France dating back more than 110 years, Swiss Life is a leader in the insurance and asset management industries. The group chose Tableau in order to provide its teams with high-performance and cross-functional dashboards. Implementing an internal data culture allows Swiss Life to place data at the heart of its performance, thereby becoming a data-driven company that is better able to ensure innovation in its practices and identify business opportunities. Swiss Life needed to streamline its data visualisation solutions. Three of these were already deployed within the group. Yet they gave rise to issues related to homogeneity and reliability of results, forcing IT to multiply their feeds and analysts to rely on different data sources. The system therefore suffered from a certain complexity related to the technology and costs. The deployment is progressing continuously today. Swiss Life chose to rely on data sources that were already structured in order to be successful and to avoid having to tap into heterogeneous data that requires multiple connectors. In reality, the data displayed could only be effective if the sources were clear right from the start. Data marts containing all of the data to be used from more than 100 different sources were therefore either constructed or enriched upstream. A team was set up to manage and publish the indicators for implementation of the main project dedicated to customer relations. This team proved to be a guarantee of data reliability. It still remains the first point of contact today for all teams in this area who use Tableau within Swiss Life. It all started in 2017 with a study carried out on the decision-making architecture within Swiss Life. The aim of this was to determine the best data visualisation tool that allows data analysts to create dynamic and tailor-made dashboards. The study recommended opting for Tableau following a competitive bid process involving several stakeholders. The experts were of the opinion that this solution represented the most innovative tool, both from an analytical point of view and in terms of the user experience. The first Tableau licence was therefore purchased by Swiss Life at the end of 2017 with support from Actinvision, which played a role in integrating the solution. As a Tableau partner for several years, Actinvision was selected to support the teams with cultural adaptation of the solution and to help the analysts become familiar with the software. Each employee had previously had their own tool to manage. The Tableau solution means that managers and analysts now have common indicators available. Managers have the benefit of a comprehensive overview which allows them to distribute work and manage their specific activities more effectively. Tableau in particular allows them to customise their dashboards and carry out their own analyses based on their own data. The analysts have a detailed view available that gives them access to substantial amounts of data. This means that they can construct dashboards which the managers are then able to access. A total of 225 dashboards have been created which can be viewed by employees at any time, and which provide as many as 1,630 different views. This new approach has resulted in undeniable efficiency and productivity savings. Swiss Life has trained more than 200 users since 2018, with this figure set to rise to 300 by the end of 2020. The company continues to work hand in hand with Tableau and Actinvision with the aim of increasing use of the solution within the company. More than 10 days of training have taken place in one year with contributions from Tableau and Actinvision experts aimed at highlighting specific usage cases. The support provided by Actinvision promoted a cross-functional approach, thereby engaging a wide range of employees. This selection ensured that confidence was generated, which is essential in assisting with cultural adaptation and the use of common indicators. Another crucial input was that Swiss Life began to pursue a change management process aimed at developing a data culture with Actinvision\u2019s support. This process is based on the approaches common to Tableau\u2019s \u201cblueprint\u201d method. Specifically, it enabled internal communities to be put in place centred around data. This way, Swiss Life is progressing towards becoming a data-driven company, i.e. an organisation that places data at the heart of its growth strategy. Swiss Life has managed to create an internal community by implementing:\n- \u201cDashboard Shows\u201d: community-based events where users get together each quarter to share tips and to learn about other usage cases;\n- newsletters published every two months with advice to analysts, useful links for specific user profiles and information for the internal community on progress regarding analytical uses."

        "title": "Siemens gains deeper understanding of IT service costs, consumption and user satisfaction with Tableau",
        "company": "Siemens AG",
        "content": "Siemens AG is a global technology powerhouse that has stood for engineering excellence, innovation, quality, reliability and internationality for more than 170 years. The company is active around the globe, focusing on the areas of power generation and distribution, intelligent infrastructure for buildings and distributed energy systems, and automation and digitalization in the process and manufacturing industries. In fiscal 2019 (ending September 30, 2019) Siemens generated revenue of \u20ac86.8 billion and net income of \u20ac5.6 billion. At the end of September 2019, the company had around 385,000 employees worldwide. Tableau supports Siemens IT to analyze and harness data. Insights are available on demand, which previously consumed a lot of the IT Controlling team\u2019s time and resources. Trusted data and drill-down capabilities support numerous teams for data-driven decision making, accessible across multiple devices within Siemens. Visual analytics has enabled Siemens businesses to improve operational efficiencies and streamline internal processes. With Tableau in place, Siemens IT is able to create management reports and better explain its IT data. Ilya Kovalenko, Data Analyst at Siemens, shares, \u201cSometimes in the past we used Excel and PowerPoint for our reporting. We spent time downloading files and there were issues with version control. It\u2019s also very hard to drill-down in Excel. When someone raised a question, we had to go back and do the calculation \u2013 and by the time we replied the data was often out of date.\u201d \u201cI downloaded the free trial [of Tableau] to get some experience. Within a very short time, I delivered an analysis that the team had spent weeks working on.\u201d The use of Tableau has subsequently spread quickly through Siemens. A new service called \u201cIntegrated Reporting and Analytic Metrics (iRAM)\u201d has been established, providing secure access to more than 15,000 report views for Siemens employees. More than 200 data sources were combined, delivering more than 7 billion asset rows organized by easily accessible topic families. \u201cIn our function alone, we have more than 2,000 active users.\u201d says Ilya. \u201cWe use Tableau Desktop for development. Tableau Server gives our users secure access to information and dashboards directly in their browser.\u201d One of the first Tableau projects for Ilya and his team was to examine IT usage and costs in Siemens IT infrastructure. \u201cThe visual analytics were so well received, that I was invited to work in Germany and help establish similar visualizations for global analysis.\u201d Tableau is having a similar impact on the ServiceNow digital IT assets workflow platform. Multiple Siemens units use ServiceNow to provide a seamless user experience across multiple providers, from ordering IT services to lifecycle management for IT products. \u201cWe use ServiceNow to bring together all the data from our IT providers, manage orders, create tickets and adjust services,\u201d explains Ilya. \u201cThanks to Tableau we now have better transparency into our IT costs and consumption. For example, we can see who consumes which IT service and their location; plus we can drill down by geographical level, divisional level, or organizational level.\u201d This insight into the cost of IT services is especially valuable to Siemens\u2019 finance department. From the consumption reports, they can see exactly which department is consuming which services in which geography. The information is used to support budget forecasts and plan future IT expenditure and services. In addition to gaining new insights, Tableau is also saving a significant amount of time. For Ilya, one particular example stands out. \u201cOne team was frustrated by the reliance on standard software for analysis. They would download and extract the data, then rework it and send the information in Excel. We quickly automated this process in Tableau, and the team asked us what they were supposed to do with the half day they\u2019d saved! We literally saved them half a day every week and they are still using this report after two years.\u201d Ilya\u2019s team uses Tableau to quickly reach the root of IT problems. For example, they can analyze users\u2019 tickets against the complaint and search for recurring patterns. They can then identify where complaints are occurring \u2013 whether it\u2019s a network issue, a specific IT service or a complicated user interface \u2013 and take the necessary steps to solve the problem. Ilya underlines the transformative impact of Tableau, \u201cWe use Circuit, a real-time collaboration software provided by Atos/Unify. When we deployed this tool, we needed to gather user feedback, so we implemented a one-to-five star-based rating. After every call, the users receives a popup window asking them to rate the voice quality.\u201d Ilya was surprised to be confronted with a complaint during a visit abroad. \u201cI was talking with a regional Head of IT and he mentioned that a lot of users were not happy with Circuit. I asked him how he knew that, and he said, \u2018I heard some rumors in the kitchen; employees were complaining\u2019. I replied saying, \u2018Let\u2019s open the rating report and see what people are really thinking\u2019. We studied the report live in Tableau and saw feedback from 10,000 users with an average score of 4.4, which is very high.\u201d False impressions \u2013 based on hearsay \u2013 are immediately corrected using accurate, up-to-date data insights. \u201cThis validates the power of Tableau: we can display trusted insights and answer questions using any device immediately,\u201d Ilya concludes.

        "title": "Tesco uses Tableau to better understand the training needs of thousands of employees",
        "company": "Tesco UKI",
        "content": "Tesco is using Tableau within its Customer Engagement Centre in order to better understand the training needs of 1,000+ employees, as well as demonstrate a tangible return on investment (ROI) on its Learning and Development (L&D) programme. Tableau enables Tesco to unlock important insights that help them deliver impactful L&D programmes for employees and the business. It\u2019s estimated that more than \u00a340 billion is spent on training in the United Kingdom, making it a significant area of investment for many organisations. However, employee development is notoriously difficult to quantify and, without the right tools in place, Tesco found it challenging to accurately understand what kind of return it was making on its investment. \u201cTesco takes employee development very seriously and is extremely proud of its L&D programme,\u201d says Derek Mitchell, Insight and Analytics Manager at Tesco\u2019s Customer Engagement Centre, in the UK. \u201cBut prior to using Tableau, it was almost impossible to really understand how that investment was affecting key areas such as employee efficiency, or satisfaction over the long term.\u201d When Derek joined the business in 2019, Tableau was already in use at its Dundee campus, but not to its full potential. \u201cEmployees were analysing single Excel files in Tableau, but there was no consolidation of data sources or advanced functionality in use,\u201d says Derek. \u201cAdditionally, a lot of L&D data was stored across multiple disparate sources, making it very hard to analyse in a comprehensive manner.\u201d Derek\u2019s team began by consolidating all three major L&D data sources \u2013 performance data in SQL Server, attendee feedback in Microsoft Forms, and L&D sentiment in Excel \u2013 together in Tableau, replacing 74 individual data charts with one single source of truth. His team then combined key information from those data sets together for the first time in a dedicated dashboard, revealing three key areas where ROI could be tangibly demonstrated to the senior leadership team. These areas included: learner sentiment towards the training experience, learner confidence in the topic, and learner performance against KPI\u2019s post-training. \u201cBy comparing attendee feedback from Microsoft Forms against performance data in SQL Server, we started seeing some interesting patterns,\u201d says Derek. \u201cFor instance, we were able to see for the first time that simply looking at whether attendees enjoyed an experience was no predictor of a shift in performance post-training.\u201d \u201cWithout Tableau, important insights like this would still be going undiscovered, buried in spreadsheets and forms spread across the business,\u201d continues Derek. \u201cNow we can use them to create tangible links between the training we are providing and the improvements in everyday employee performance, which is invaluable.\u201d Using Tableau, Tesco can proactively track the L&D needs of employees right down to an individual level. \u201cBy importing all performance and learning data into Tableau and visualising the two together, we can see individual employee performance across a wide range of business areas,\u201d says Derek. \u201cThen we can analyse this against which L&D courses they have attended recently, which not only tells us if additional training may be required, but also which existing courses are the most effective and which need further refinement.\u201d At Tesco, they are using Tableau to analyse written feedback from training course attendees, uncovering key insights that were otherwise nearly impossible to spot. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to quantify written comments using conventional tools. So much of the post-course attendee feedback of this nature was simply stored in an Excel file where little had been done with it,\u201d explains Derek. \u201cUsing Tableau, we were able to parse out all the comments into individual words, then visualise them in word clouds using a sentiment engine.\u201d \u201cWhen we looked at the word clouds, we found that 25 percent of all negative comments were about the temperature of the room during the course, while a further 13 percent were about problems with system access from those trying to attend courses remotely,\u201d adds Derek. \u201cThese are the kinds of insights we\u2019d never have realised without the visual analysis Tableau lets us do. But armed with this knowledge, we can quickly eradicate some of the biggest pain points for attendees in just a few simple steps.\u201d Before Tableau, Tesco employed two full-time staff members dedicated exclusively to producing Excel reports on L&D activity. Now, nearly all reporting is automated in Tableau, saving thousands of hours annually and allowing Tesco\u2019s L&D experts to focus on effective training and improving content, rather than time-consuming manual reporting tasks. \u201cAs soon as somebody submits a piece of L&D feedback on a standardised form, it gets pulled into Tableau where it\u2019s joined up with all their performance data for the four weeks pre-learning and four weeks post-learning,\u201d says Derek. \u201cFrom there it\u2019s automatically compared against their peers, helping us to proactively track their L&D needs.\u201d As part of this automation process, Tesco has decreased the number of questions asked to train course attendees, improving the overall feedback response rate. \u201cPreviously we would ask course attendees 28 separate questions, which led to a high dropout rate,\u201d says Derek. \u201cNow, we ask everyone the same five questions, reducing effort by 80 percent. The result is a much higher response rate, giving us a richer, more consistent data set that we can analyse in Tableau and use to improve future L&D offerings.\u201d The impact Tableau has made on Tesco\u2019s L&D efforts within such a short amount of time has not gone unnoticed to other areas of the organisation. Benefits of flexibility, ease-of-use and scalability have made Tableau integral to making data-driven decisions, with an impact reaching beyond L&D. \u201cPeople see how easy Tableau makes it to understand complex data sets and they soon want to know how they can apply it to their own business areas,\u201d explains Derek."

        "company": "Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership",
        "content": "Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership (GMHSCP) is responsible for the physical and mental wellbeing of over 2.8 million citizens living in 10 localities that make up Greater Manchester, UK. In April 2016, it became the first formally devolved healthcare service in the UK, putting it in charge of its own health/social care services and spending plans. Shortly after devolution took place, GMHSCP invested in a major overhaul of its data infrastructure, replacing the existing network of disparate spreadsheets with a Microsoft SQL data warehouse and Tableau, as part of a new digital strategy. Doing so has enabled true collaboration across the whole partnership for the first time, reducing data silos and creating greater transparency. This has had a particularly significant impact on A&E activity, where all 11 hospitals within the partnership can now work together through Tableau, using near real-time data to make informed tactical decisions and deliver the highest quality patient care possible. Prior to devolution in 2016, most NHS organisations and local authorities in the Greater Manchester area either had no or not fit for purpose business information (BI) tools in place for analysis, collaboration or dissemination. Instead, many relied on a system of local spreadsheets, databases or bespoke web based systems, resulting in numerous disparate approaches making collaborative analytics and data sharing extremely difficult. When Graham Beales joined the newly formed GMHSCP as Head of Business Intelligence, it quickly became clear that a new solution was needed on both the data and visualisation sides. \u201cI came into a nest of spreadsheets and no BI function of which to speak,\u201d says Graham. \u201cThere was no real architecture in place and the only reports being created were constitutional reports that are part of the partnership\u2019s statutory duties. There was scope to do so much more.\u201d As a prior Tableau user, Graham quickly started demonstrating the benefits it could bring to the GMHSCP. After positive initial feedback he teamed up with IT service management partner, InterWorks, to present a case for its adoption as part of a wider infrastructure overhaul. \u201cI built a strategy that focused on investing in a new data warehouse to centralise all data from the wider system that wasn\u2019t currently accessible,\u201d says Graham. \u201cFrom there, we needed to visualise and disseminate that information as efficiently as possible and I knew Tableau would be the perfect tool for this.\u201d Graham\u2019s proposal aligned closely with the partnership\u2019s new digital strategy, which placed strong emphasis on the adoption of highly accessible, cloud-based, infrastructure independent solutions. The implementation also coincided with development of a new overarching BI function across the partnership, which ensured strong buy-in from all members and helped encourage a much smoother, more collaborative approach to data management going forward. \u201cIt was very important that it wasn\u2019t seen as something we were doing in an ivory tower,\u201d says Graham. \u201cThe approach we took meant we were able to bring everyone on the same journey, helping the whole of the GMHSCP analytical community to develop and enhance their skills.\u201d GMHSCP\u2019s new infrastructure sees data stored in a Microsoft SQL data warehouse, with Tableau used for all analytics and visualisation needs. Both are housed within GMSS shared services architecture, making them accessible to nearly all of the organisations within the wider partnership, allowing for faster data collaboration, sharing and reporting. In the past 12 months, the number of developers trained to use Tableau has risen from 20 to well over 100, reflecting the growing investment that organisations throughout GMHSCP are making in its use. Graham notes that much of this success to date was made possible with the support received from InterWorks. \u201cThey worked with us to develop business plans and get the right level of resourcing, which had to be flexible as our needs have changed throughout the process,\u201d says Graham. \u201cWe also developed bespoke Tableau training using real NHS data, which has really helped to accelerate employee understanding and skill development.\u201d In addition to GMHSCP, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), led by Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, has also trained many of its research team members on Tableau, who are now using the platform as their main method of data visualisation, collaboration and development as well. \u201cOne of the mayor\u2019s key pledges last year was for greater transparency with the public around children and young people\u2019s mental health in the Greater Manchester area,\u201d says Graham. \u201cThe report released by the GMCA at the end of December 2018 was completely built in Tableau and was the direct result of close collaboration with mental health providers throughout the partnership.\u201d The report is the first of its kind in the UK, shedding light on key areas such as the waiting times experienced at different stages of the treatment process. It also offers clear transparency and clinical rationale as to why the GMHSCP isn\u2019t quite where it wants to be yet and how it intends to get there in the future. The GMCA has made a commitment to release the report to the public on a quarterly basis, so they can track whether improvements are being made or not. \u201cWhile the report will only be available to the public as a static PDF for the time being, internally it\u2019s a fully interactive Tableau dashboard that can be used by all of our providers and commissioners, as well as ourselves,\u201d says Graham. \u201cFor the first time we\u2019ve got a single source of truth that can be shared across multiple organisations, which is a huge step for us.\u201d One of GMHSCP\u2019s flagship Tableau initiatives is the development of its Urgent Care Reporting Tool, which collates status information from all 11 of its A&E departments into a single dashboard in near-real time, allowing for fast, tactical decision making. \u201cUsing Tableau, we can see everything that\u2019s happening in our hospitals, from how many people are there, to how long they\u2019ve been waiting and if they require a bed,\u201d says Graham. \u201cThat information allows everyone to make informed decisions throughout the day and work collaboratively as a group to deliver the levels of care required, rather than as 11 separate entities.\u201d The Urgent Care Reporting Tool is also available via Tableau Mobile, meaning on-call response officers can quickly log in and assess the current system status from wherever they are, at any given time during their shift. GMHSCP is now also working alongside the Greater Manchester Emergency Response Hub to see how the dashboard can be used to deliver even higher quality of care, based on the specific needs of individual patients. \u201cUsing Tableau alongside existing infrastructure, hub commanders can reach into the stack of waiting ambulances and make a clinical assessment about a particular patient\u201d says Graham. \u201cArmed with this information, they might be able to divert an ambulance to a neighbouring A&E where the patient will be in and out two hours faster than if they are simply taken to the nearest one. Not only is this better for the patient, it makes for a much more effective system as a whole.\u201d"

        "company": "Southwest Airlines",
        "content": "With more than 700 aircraft operating at least 4,000 daily flights, Southwest Airlines is the largest carrier of domestic passengers in the US. The airline captures data throughout their operations, from planes, airports, customers, crew members and maintenance. Previously, Southwest's data was siloed and maintained in different legacy platforms, posing a dilemma. The absence of an enterprise-wide view made it difficult to quickly consume, integrate, cleanse and analyse the swelling data, resulting in discrepancies, duplications and multiple sources of truth. The IT team selected Tableau to enable a culture of self-service analytics at scale and provide a secure environment to explore trusted data, bringing everyone onto the same page. Tableau has connected the dots \u2013 from maintenance and finance to customer service \u2013 and real-time insights are driving efficiencies and casting light on opportunities, like where to add routes or how to reduce gate waiting times. Southwest now uses Tableau to capture and engage with the data needed to maintain excellent performance and ensure passengers have successful journeys. Through organic growth, they've scaled from 3 to 2,900 active Tableau users across 36 departments. As Southwest grew, acquiring AirTran, adding to its fleet and expanding internationally, they needed to shift to self-service analytics and customised business intelligence that scaled with the business and allowed them to react more quickly to growing data sets. Business groups needed an immediate and accurate understanding of the trips customers booked and flew, and whether they arrived on schedule to ensure optimised on-time performance (OTP) and customer satisfaction. Without an enterprise-wide view of their data captured in real-time, Southwest couldn\u2019t see how different parts of operations were performing to asses if they could do better for customers or keep up with competition, growth and change. Previously, to understand their fleet performance, Southwest\u2019s IT team manually pulled data from legacy systems and various sources, including Access, Excel, Oracle, SQL Server and Teradata, its enterprise data warehouse. With 28 different departments generating and analysing different data, information was fractured, making it difficult to get a complete picture of their performance. To complicate matters, not everyone had access to the same data, triggering different perspectives and confusion at times. Tom Laney, business consultant with the Data Science Center team noted, \u201cOur enterprise data was siloed all over the place. It was disparate, complex, some varying degrees of messy and clean; it was found in remote areas all over the company.\u201d To connect it all, IT relied on SQL queries, which were difficult to update, maintain and share. As a result, business groups had trouble integrating, cleansing, analysing and consuming the data. With increased demands, Southwest approached Tableau to adapt from centralised data management to self-service analytics at scale. Three users began with Tableau Desktop and published reports to Tableau Server. They socialised their experience and organically grew adoption to more than 2,900 active users on Tableau Server in 4 years and 400 Tableau Desktop licences. \u201cAs soon as we started demoing Tableau, anyone who had analytically savvy minds just had to see it,\u201d explained Tom. The effects on the business were significant: faster time-to-insights helped Southwest quickly spot new opportunities, drive greater efficiencies, and increase time and cost savings. IT supported the development of mini production areas, empowering people to ask and answer their questions through analysis. With Tableau now capturing data from disparate sources and generating dashboards that are automatically refreshed, analysts no longer spent days manually piecing together the data for reports and presentations that were hard to update, maintain and share with others. The Operational Performance Department that is in charge of tracking OTP is now able to offer a near real-time, company-wide OTP every 15 minutes, tracking performance against historical activity. All photos provided courtesy of Southwest Airlines. The Technical Operation Fleet Reliability Group provides insights on maintenance and engineering. To manage the overall health of Southwest Airlines\u2019 fleet, the group analyses data generated by Flight Operations, Ground Operations, Inflight and Technical Operations, combined with data from the on-board aircraft systems. Unfortunately, Excel and PowerPoint weren\u2019t delivering the analytics that the team needed to address urgent requests and deliver answers about plane maintenance history to ensure the fleet operated at the highest standard. \u201cWe had to do something different because our leadership was calling for more information on-demand versus the \u2018we\u2019ll get it to you in a week\u2019 approach,\u201d said Troy Roskop, Manager of Aircraft Reliability. As Tableau adoption grew for the airline, Troy\u2019s team jumped onboard. In four months, they were using Tableau to author interactive dashboards and embed them in Southwest\u2019s web portal where leadership could go to understand aircraft maintenance history. Southwest achieved a single source of truth for maintenance using Tableau to drill into the data and see if aircraft met maintenance standards, while also standardising maintenance monitoring and increasing precision with real-time analysis. Their analysts have cut out days of work, no longer creating new monthly reports, while leadership is satisfied with immediate insights and answers. The Network and Capacity Planning Group works with profitability data to analyse performance across routes, stations and regions. Previously, this involved quarterly maintenance of a cumbersome, physical profitability binder, reflecting nearly 100 stations and more than 600 routes. It was an ineffective way for leaders to review the information and given the data volume, it quickly became outdated. The team have created multiple visualisations with Tableau, including maps that reflect individual route performance, station performance and regional performance together, which help them make stronger capacity recommendations, including additions of new stations or routes. The team can now easily capture and analyse profitability data for consumption by the rest of the group along with senior leadership. Leaders like Allan Kavalich, Senior Business Consultant, Network Planning and Capacity Planning have experienced massive time savings and improved the effectiveness of day-to-day decisions. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s been nice for my day-to-day job life; I basically have office hours where people from our group come over and I answer Tableau questions.\u201d More recently, the team analysed ZIP code trends within customer data to better understand travel preferences for their passengers. They found that several customers favour non-stop flights from a further airport rather than travelling from the closest airport. Customer analysis uncovered new opportunities to add routes in the Los Angeles Basin, and Southwest is now satisfying customers with more direct flights from airports that are closest to their home. Airlines face challenging decisions when trying to optimise fuel capacity because fuel prices vary from city to city. It\u2019s a balancing act and sometimes more cost effective to purchase fuel at a lower price and carry it onboard until needed versus having to refuel at a more expensive destination. To offset higher-priced fuel and determine an optimal set of stations that Southwest should use for tankering, the team analysed all 99 of Southwest\u2019s stations with Tableau. There were many factors involved with assessing cost savings: the price per gallon at each location, cost differences to travel to and from stations, the number of flights each aircraft has flown, and airport fuel constraints. Southwest ultimately discovered the 20 stations with the most potential to support fuelling and savings, growing the total savings on tankering. Southwest Airlines has seven reservation centres that handle customer requests and inquiries. These centres are supported by analysts based at the company headquarters. Recently, Katherine McCloskey, Senior Reporting Analyst in the Customer Support & Services department worked with regional team leaders to create a set of dashboards to track team performance over time. The reporting group consolidated data stored in Microsoft SQL Server and Teradata, along with survey data stored in Microsoft Access and Excel, to create a universal view of call behaviour. Today, leaders can see real-time feedback on team performance scores and representatives can track their improvement. Around 240 people in a range of roles consume these dashboards. During a recent process change, Katherine caught some outliers in the data. They revealed that the process changes impacted call volumes on another team. \u201cUsing the forecasting in Tableau, I was able to catch that with the more resources and calls going into this area, another metric was going up, which was not anticipated,\u201d shared Katherine. \u201cThe teams were able to make the changes necessary to then prevent any problems.\u201d From plane and tarmac staff to the operations leadership and management, a majority of Southwest\u2019s teams now have access to a trusted, secure environment to explore real-time data with Tableau. The company has published over 2,000 workbooks, not only increasing collaboration with data, but improving morale, as people feel greater value and impact from their work. With a modern analytics approach that benefits everyone, the sky\u2019s the limit for Southwest Airlines."

        "company": "Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated",
        "content": "The Coca-Cola Company is the world\u2019s largest beverage company, with over 500 brands and 3,900 products. Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated (CCBCC) is Coca-Cola\u2019s largest independent bottling partner. With Tableau, CCBCC\u2019s IT and business intelligence teams replaced a daily 45-minute manual reporting process. Today, teams can understand metrics like delivery operations, budget and profitability with a few clicks, consolidating data from hundreds of disparate sources. As a result, sales teams can now access mobile dashboards on iPads in the field, increasing timeliness to sell more product. And now, executive reports automatically refresh in Tableau Server on a daily basis, driving strategic decision-making. Coca-Cola Bottling Company\u2019s (CCBCC) business intelligence team handles reporting for all sales and delivery operations. Shawn Crenshaw, Senior Business Analyst, explains how the team answers questions such as: \u201cAre we delivering product at the time we say we're going to deliver it? Are we meeting that budget? And how well are we doing against that forecast budget?\u201d Previously, the team spent a majority of their time building reports. It could take days to bring together up to 200 million lines of data from 100 different systems into a data warehouse to then build a portion of one usable dashboard. \u201cWe were using a Pinto for our data and we needed a Mercedes\u201d, says Kevin King, Director of Reporting and Analytics. Kevin recalls coming into the office at 7:30 in the morning, seven days a week to refresh the company\u2019s daily sales report, which took about 45 minutes. And the final dashboard had up to ten tabs that leadership had to click through to see any granularity in the data. When CCBCC adopted Tableau as its analytics platform, teams completely streamlined their processes. For the daily sales report, Kevin set up automatic refreshes in Tableau Server so data updates every day at 5:30 a.m. Leadership can access current numbers every morning, drill down to the lowest level of data, and Kevin and his team can spend their mornings on more productive tasks. The new enterprise-wide analytics strategy serves the needs of various audiences and roles. For example, leadership dashboards focus on strategy, business growth and profitability. Management dashboards \u2013 targeted at area sales managers, supervisors, etc. \u2013 assist with coaching, training and employee development. Managers can see high-level overviews of each area or drill down into employee-level data. Field sales dashboards allow sales teams to see a full overview of customer portfolios or track sales quotas. The entire business intelligence team spends less time on manual reporting and more time solving crucial problems and driving the business forward: \u201cIf I'm doing same thing over and over again, I'm never able to step out the box. Tableau allows us to step out of the box and look at data in a totally different way, which is really what we're here to do,\u201d says Kevin. \u201cFrom there, we can help them make decisions that drive profitability.\u201d Coca-Cola Bottling Company sells to grocery stores and pubs, all the way up to big superstores like Walmart. With this breadth of buyers, Coca-Cola\u2019s leadership team aimed to bring mobile analytics to the field sales force via iPads. \u201cWe try to make sure our sales force is not stuck in the office, because we're primarily responsible for selling the product. And spending time in an office looking at metrics, crunching numbers is not their job. Their job is to sell product,\u201d shares Shawn Crenshaw, Senior Business Analyst. Previously it took up to a whole work day for a sales representative to find metrics around sales performance. With Tableau Mobile, the field sales team and Coca-Cola executives can access analytics in a few clicks. The business intelligence team now creates mobile versions of dashboards to optimise the user experience. \u201cEverything we've built has to be efficient enough that somebody can get to it in two clicks and they can make a decision right then and there. Tableau has provided us with the ability to not only provide accurate data, but to customise it for the user experience.\u201d Today, sales representatives can pull up the data anywhere and at any time when they\u2019re out in the field \u2013 increasing agility to help sell more product. \u201c[Both] people in the field and our executives are out in the markets, they're out with customers. So if they have questions, instead of them having to pull up an Excel spreadsheet or pull up some kind of document, they go straight to their iPad, pull up a dashboard and answer the questions right then and there.\u201d When adopting Tableau as CCBCC\u2019s enterprise platform, the business intelligence team partnered with IT to create a scalable, long-term solution for self-service analytics. The business intelligence team worked with IT to ensure the proper governance was in place, while shifting day-to-day analytics tasks towards the business. \u201cWith this self-service concept, it's no longer an order-taker type of mentality [for IT]\u2026 If you say, we\u2019re going to partner with you, the businessperson can do what they know how to do, and the IT person doesn't necessarily have to know the intricacies or the ins and outs of the business,\u201d says Bryan Franklin, Business Data Architect. \u201cThat sort of collaboration and being able to work together as a team \u2013 I think that builds the relationship between IT and the business.\u201d The result was a faster analytics cycle, leading to more engagement from the business side. And with fewer day-to-day analytics tasks, IT can focus more on long-term data strategy and innovation."

        "company": "Arby's Restaurant Group -",
        "content": "Arby\u2019s Restaurant Group is the franchisor of the well-loved American fast-casual brand. Arby\u2019s used Tableau to map customer behaviour using point-of-sale data, discovering that remodelling locations led to increased sales. With this knowledge, Arby\u2019s executed five times more remodels within a year. Automating the Financial Planning and Analysis group\u2019s 6-hour reporting process in Tableau helped operations track promotion success and spot issues, impacting field responses and saving money. When Arby\u2019s Restaurant Group was renovating their chain of restaurants, they faced some questions. What happens to the customers when a restaurant closes for renovation? Where do they go? And do they come back when the restaurant reopens? Mapping point of sale (POS) data in Tableau, the Business Intelligence team monitored the flow of customers to nearby locations during renovation periods, tracking remodel progress by week and overall return on investment. \u201cIn the remodel, we plotted the stores, their latitude and longitude, on a map in Tableau. We would animate it over time, and as a store closed for remodel, you would see sales grow for the stores around it,\u201d said Karl Riddett, Manager of Business Intelligence and Analytics. When the restaurants reopened, they saw customers flocking to renovated stores, proving that a fresh look attracted more business. \u201cThe remodel dashboard specifically allows our CFO and VP of Finance and development officers to see how well the remodels are performing,\u201d said Karl. \u201cThe data showed that we need to spend more money remodelling our restaurants, freshening up the look. That it really has helped the business.\u201d Based on this knowledge, Arby\u2019s executed five times the amount of remodels within a year and continued this effort throughout the following year. In addition to remodels, the team uses Tableau to correlate evaluation data and qualitative scores. For example, Arby\u2019s combines point-of-sale and guest experience data to understand whether customers have had a positive brand experience \u2013 and to predict if a customer is likely to return to the store, use a coupon, etc. Arby\u2019s used this quantitative data to track the success of their \u201cGive a Dollar\u201d charity promotion where a customer would give a dollar and get a $2 coupon in return. Karl recalled, \u201cOur controller came to me and said, \u2018Hey, could you see what we can do with Tableau because we're seeing some funny things with the data coming in.\u2019 They could tell something wasn't right, but they didn't know what it was.\u201d With Tableau, the team could spot the issue, take action and distribute the data to the field to make the necessary changes. \u201cWe produced the dashboard, we put it out in the field, and the directors in the field made changes. And you could see that we got the issue corrected. So we're seeing operations actually make changes because they're able to see the data and see what was going on.\u201d \u201cThere was a real financial impact that saved the company some money and saved our foundation some money as well.\u201d After seeing the success of the remodel dashboard, Arby\u2019s Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) team approached the analytics team about their six-hour Excel reporting process. With Tableau, the FP&A team eliminated the six-hour process and gained deeper insight into finance data. For example, the team can now track how remodelled restaurants impact existing restaurant sales \u2013 enabling accurate forecasting and data-driven decision making around franchise planning. These Tableau projects inspired Arby\u2019s to create an analytics committee, which meets monthly to discuss the vision for future analytics efforts. The committee encourages departments to explore Tableau Server to source inspiration for new dashboards. These efforts increased collaboration between teams and created one centralised repository for accurate data, which didn\u2019t exist before Tableau. \u201cIt gives one place for people to go to and see what's going on. We didn't have that before at Arby's. I think the real ROI that we're seeing is with certain people being able to really fully express themselves and what they want to do in their role and answer questions.\u201d"

        "company": "Merkle",
        "content": "Tableau: Can you start by telling me a little bit about how Merkle is using Tableau?\nDavid Andrade, Senior Business Intelligence Analyst: We're a marketing company, so there's a lot of campaign dashboards that we do, campaign performance dashboards. It helps keep and maintain efficiency when you're actually building dashboards. We do a lot of mock-ups in Tableau just because it's so fast to do it. Tableau Server helps us automate dashboarding for our clients, and this helps really free up time for certain people so that they can focus more on driving insights rather than building reports. Primarily at Merkle we use it for external clients, because we work with many clients day-to-day. We also use Tableau internally in the company. So we're building operations reports, we're doing performance reports in Tableau, etc. Tableau: That\u2019s great to hear. You have some huge clients \u2013 can we assume you\u2019re analysing large volumes of data?\nDavid: At Merkle we deal with all sorts of data. We do big data, we do medium data, we do small data. We do all the data. Any one of those pieces of data could be just as important as the other. Feeding it into a tool like Tableau so you can really explore that data\u2026 It just really helps. Tableau: Typically, what data sources do you connect to?\nDavid: There are a number of different data sources that we can connect to. We're connecting Tableau to SQL Server most of the time, but we also have Excel files and text files that we work with. We're connecting it to Salesforce internally in the company. Really the sky's the limit with Tableau. As long as you have data, you can build it. Tableau: Do you blend data from different data sources?\nDavid: Yes. I can just connect to my data sources, I can say, \u2018All right, well, I want to take this thing from this data source, that thing from that data source and just blend the two together,\u2019 and it's \u2013 it's really fast and easy. Tableau: And you are using Tableau Server to share those dashboards?\nDavid: Tableau Server is a really great way to get a customer to go online, view and interact with their data. It could be a live connection, it could be an extract of the data or a snapshot of your data. And it's an easy way for an end user to just go, consume the data, get what they need to see, and then just get right out and start making those business decisions. Tableau: What is the benefit of sharing your dashboards this way?\nDavid: People love seeing that they can just go right into the dashboard, refresh it and it's there. The data is there for them to see and use. So it really helps just create a better environment for consuming that data and making decisions off it. It's almost addictive to me! I just can't stop using the tool. Once I start developing, I just can't stop doing it. Tableau: We love to hear that! How is the reaction to Tableau within Merkle? Do your co-workers like it as much as your clients do?\nDavid: It's actually spreading like wildfire across our entire organisation. There are people all over Merkle that are using Tableau, and every day it seems like I'm getting new requests for people to get Desktop licences, because everyone just wants to get their hands on it. Tableau: Where did you first come across Tableau?\nDavid: I was actually first introduced to Tableau in business school. And I was in an IT class. We were learning different tools and technologies, and Tableau was one of the things that our professor encouraged us to look into. What I really love about Tableau is that not only is it accessible, it's also really visually aesthetic. I just love working in a tool and playing around with it. And the charts that Tableau can produce for you are just amazing."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: What made you look to Tableau for support with analytics?\nTorry Johnson, Senior Business Analyst: For us analysts, Tableau Desktop has been a great tool to work with these large data sets that we have to find insights. It's quick and it's easy. It's been a lot better than digging through raw data. And we\u2019re starting to get more and more adoption, more excitement around Tableau Server with different people within the company, which is nice for us because we spend less time building reports for them and they spend more time actually utilising the data that we have available. Steve Brownell, Senior Data & Analytics Specialist: I generate a lot of information that other people use to try to inform our higher-level executives and people all throughout the organisation so that they're enabled to make intelligent decisions with data. Torry Johnson: Ultimately we want our users to be able to use Zillow to find a home, which is the biggest purchase they'll make in their life and it's a very personal purchase. By finding ways to help make this process easier for them, we make it not so stressful to make this purchase that should be kind of a fun and exciting event. Tableau: How are Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server proving to be valuable?\nSteve: Our rentals dashboard on Tableau Server enables us to dive into states and feed providers with our rental listings and we can look for quality issues both by cross cuts across both those dimensions. We can really dive into where we have opportunities or issues with data quality and prioritise different regions to go after to acquire new listings. Torry: A lot of the data sets we work with are quite large, and Tableau gives us a way to dig into that data and kind of quickly see where it is that something interesting is happening - whether there's an outlier in a certain area, or if there's a particular metric that we're looking at that's going to point us towards a big opportunity or possibly a problem with a product. Tableau: How big is your data set?\nTorry: We have data on every home in the US, and that\u2019s over 100 million homes - so that's over 100 million rows just in that database. Steve: We\u2019ve got lots of different meta-data dimensions across contacts - where consumers are contacting real estate agents through Zillow? Was it on a mobile app? Was it on a for-sale property? Was it a rental? Torry: We also have a mortgage product where lenders provide tens of millions of loan quotes every month to users who are trying to find the best rate on a mortgage - that's hundreds of millions of rows. Just being able to crunch that data into something manageable is where Tableau really helps us. Tableau: How does Tableau help you examine that data?\nTorry: With large data sets, we're looking at a lot of things like distributions and histograms and we're looking for anything that might point out an opportunity for us to possibly generate more revenue, or create something that helps our customers in their experience shopping for homes. Steve: We can allow the product managers to basically slice all that data in Tableau Server by setting up a bunch of filters so that they can do the analysis that they want, and we just provide the data for them to make the insights. Torry: Real estate is very geographical and because Tableau has such strong mapping support, it's really super useful to us. Rather than just line charts and bar charts, we can provide more context so the business owner can be looking for patterns in geography. This is hard to do without a map. There aren't a lot of other products out there that have the built-in, drag-and-drop map interface. Tableau: What are some patterns Tableau has illuminated?\nSteve: Using this Tableau Server dashboard, we found there's a geographical discrepancy where some people label a unit as a condo, and others label it as an apartment. So we thought that we had this weird mix of units, but it actually turned out to just be geographical terminology. Once we saw that on a map, we knew how to come at the problem a little bit better. Torry: With hundreds of millions of loan quotes, some users don\u2019t get a lot of quotes for the particular loan they're looking for. By looking at the distribution of this data and how it's spread out across different loan types, we can figure out users who have particular credit score problems may not get as many loan quotes, or maybe if you want an investment property it's a little harder to find a lender who's willing to lend in the current kind of real estate environment. So we can look at all these different characteristics and see what type of response users are getting, and if they're having a good experience shopping for their loan on Zillow or not. Steve: Our economics team has published a lot of things using the Tableau Public product. One really cool one that they've done is a negative equity. So if your house is underwater, you can zoom by county or zip code and see exactly how much your county or zip code is underwater on average. You can really personalise the data as opposed to just having a national snapshot number in an article; you can zoom in and see how it affects you more realistically than just the average American. That's a lot more powerful, we think. Tableau: Are you getting a good response online with Tableau Public?\nSteve: We\u2019ve had very high engagement rates with the Tableau Public products we've put out on the Web. People really enjoy seeing how they can check their neighbourhood and see how the market is affecting them. We have sorts of metrics around growth of the market and home values. People are really interested to see how their trend in a small-market area compares to other neighbourhoods. Tableau: How has the use of Tableau expanded at Zillow?\nTorry: We started by using Tableau Desktop about three years ago with roughly five users primarily on the analytics team to explore these big data sets and answer questions for different people from the business. It was more just for our analysts to dig in and look for insights. Steve: It had organic growth from there as we started to disseminate that information. We\u2019d embed it in email reports and use it in presentations when running a meeting. People always asked where we got our graphs from. Torry: Now it's really spread throughout the company as a tool that we all use. Tableau: How has Tableau Server impacted the way people at Zillow work?\nSteve: Tableau enables people to have more of a \"pull\" relationship than a \"push\" relationship with the data. So our small analytics team can better serve more users because we don\u2019t have to answer every question - instead we provide a framework for people to answer their own questions. Steve: It\u2019s just a great way to be able to interact with data as opposed to just receive data. That really adds another level of insight that you can gain by being able to not just be presented with something, but to be able to create something based off of a platform that's given to you. Tableau: How has Tableau Server impacted the way your analytics team works?\nTorry: About a year and a half ago, we switched to using Tableau Server so we could deliver more reports to users within the company. Steve: It frees up a lot of resources for us to be a little more nimble and create more platforms than answers. I feel like it increases my efficiency as an analyst because I can serve more people and it helps us to be more nimble. Torry: Anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of my time used to be spent creating ad-hoc reports and now it's dropped dramatically. Tableau Server really helped us in the BI department not have to do so many ad-hoc reporting requests that take up a lot of time. We can push things out there. They\u2019re interactive, people can dig in, they can find what they want. And we can spend our time looking for those little nuggets of insight in the data rather than just responding to requests all the time. Steve: There tend to be some power users at Zillow who really want all this extra data. For their needs, we can surface that data up in Tableau Server. Users go to the server as a data source and pull it down - they help themselves, really. Instantly, they trust it as a data source and really enjoy they can get results so quickly. Torry: If we didn't have Tableau, we would spend more of our time working one-on-one helping business people dig into data, drill down, find insights and find problems. With Tableau, they can do that in a self-serve manner and then come to us to help solve the problem rather than find it."

        "title": "How self-service analytics from Tableau is helping bol.com become a data-driven organisation",
        "company": "Bol.com",
        "content": "Bol.com is one of Europe\u2019s largest online retailers, offering a vast range of products to millions of Dutch and Belgian customers via its virtual marketplace. Here, Anne van den Brink, Business Intelligence Manager for bol.com, discusses the importance of fast, agile data analytics in online retailing and how Tableau has helped Bol.com transform into a data-driven organization, where employees can self-serve many of their own data needs. Anne, what do you think is the secret to success in today\u2019s online retail industry? Agility plays a huge role. The ability to quickly react to shifting consumer habits has always been critical in retail but particularly so online, where shoppers will soon go elsewhere if we don\u2019t have exactly what they want, when they want it. How does Tableau help bol.com stay agile? Agility is easy when you are small, but it becomes increasingly difficult as you grow, unless you have the right tools in place. This is why Tableau has become so pivotal to our business. The fast, accurate data insights it provides into key areas - like purchasing habits and seasonal trends - let us rapidly tailor our marketplace and product offerings, ensuring every customer can easily find what they need. Tableau has also given us more control over business operations, such as inventory management, assortment quality and stock levels. Doing so has enabled us to improve overall customer service levels, while simultaneously reducing our environmental impact. Why did bol.com choose Tableau over other analytics platforms? One of Tableau\u2019s key selling points for us is its extensive functionality, as illustrated by the above examples. Tableau\u2019s highly visual approach to analytics means people can view multiple insights on a single dashboard, making it easy to spot important outliers and trends. Scalability was also a big factor. In the last five years, our company has grown exponentially, meaning the number of data sources has grown to over 250, and the number of active Tableau users has increased from 200 to 750+. For many analytics platforms, these factors would present major issues, but with Tableau we can keep adding new data sources and users without any impact on overall performance. Finally, ease of use was essential. Once employees see and use Tableau for themselves, they quickly realise how simple it is to self-serve their own analytics and reporting needs instead of relying on the central BI team. Not only has this made analytics more accessible to everyone, but it\u2019s helped transform bol.com into a data-driven organisation, where data-driven insights are used to inform decision making at every level. What role has The Information Lab, a Tableau technology partner, played in your success with Tableau? Support from The Information Lab has been invaluable, particularly during the initial rollout phase. Their knowledge and expertise helped the BI team get up to speed on Tableau quickly, giving us the momentum, we needed to ensure successful implementation. Today, our team has reached a higher level of maturity and expertise, however we still appreciate The Information Lab\u2019s ongoing support and knowledge. Update (June 2020): How has being a data-driven company helped you effectively navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic? When you\u2019re a data-driven company, you have a good sense of your key priorities and everyone participates in a shared vision of using data to make every decision. This makes it a bit easier to operate effectively, even when the world is changing and full of uncertainty. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, myself and 2,000 colleagues used to work in the same office, then almost overnight everyone had to start working from home. This could have created major upheaval, but with all our teams focused around clear data-driven goals and objectives, they can continue to function autonomously despite all that\u2019s going on around them. Since lockdown started in The Netherlands on March 12, there\u2019s been a 15 per cent increase in the number of employees using Tableau daily across the business. It illustrates just how intrinsic data has become to our day-to-day operations, particularly during this unprecedented time. Of course, traditional in-person training isn\u2019t possible at the moment, but in just four weeks we created a comprehensive online course, turning all the classic Tableau training modules into e-learning sessions. This allows employees to progress their data skills at their own pace, whether they\u2019re experienced with the platform or completely new to it. Doing so helps expand the data-skills base throughout bol.com as a whole, putting us in a strong position for the future."

        "title": "Red Hat embraces Tableau Blueprint and Tableau Online, deepens data culture",
        "company": "Red Hat",
        "content": "Red Hat, Inc. is the world's leading provider of open source solutions, using a community-powered approach to deliver reliable and high-performing Linux, hybrid cloud, container, and Kubernetes technologies. Red Hat helps customers integrate new and existing IT applications, develop cloud-native applications, standardize industry-leading operating systems, and automate, secure, and manage complex environments. Growing at an accelerated rate, Red Hat used a variety of business intelligence tools in isolated situations, but lacked a coordinated approach to their enterprise analytics. With a disconnected data strategy, leaders found it complicated to see the big picture as they made key business decisions. Global staff, particularly data analysts and data engineers, also struggled to make connections among siloed data. They needed an analytics platform that spanned multiple sources, ensured agile performance, and enabled cloud-based collaboration. Red Hat decommissioned several other business intelligence platforms and replaced them with a SaaS solution\u2014Tableau Cloud, combined with Tableau Blueprint to guide their deployment strategy. Focusing on the pillars of community and proficiency, Red Hat scaled from 50 Tableau users to more than 4,500 in the first year, doubling adoption expectations in the first three months. By shifting away from multiple tools, associates were better armed with insights to make quick, confident decisions that improved performance and results. They continue to grow engagement opportunities and training, spearheaded by a new role called the Tableau Enablement Lead, part of the Enterprise Data and Analytics team, along with Tableau advocates, referred to as Project Owners, who implement and share dashboard best practices as members of the Red Hat Tableau community. When Red Hat adopted Tableau, they used Tableau Blueprint to guide their deployment journey. \u201cBlueprint demonstrated to us how Tableau approaches governance to enable speed, and that isn\u2019t something we saw before,\u201d explained Wes Gelpi, Senior Manager of Business Intelligence & Analytics. Blueprint helped analytics leadership set clear expectations and processes for governance, proficiency, collaboration, and more. \u201cTableau Blueprint enabled us to deploy more effectively and it changed how we think about Tableau going forward,\u201d added Wes. The first order of business was building out the right strategy and teams, which included a new organizational model aligning resources to business areas and documenting their enterprise data strategy. By dispersing data leaders across business units, Red Hat could simultaneously deploy an enterprise-wide solution while creating a data culture across the company. This focus on collaboration has evolved into a focus on internal community, supported through several community engagement activities. First, Red Hat has Project Owners\u2014cross-functional advocates for Tableau adoption who drive consistency across enterprise processes and business reporting. They also spearhead internal chat channels and local meetups, so people can discuss visualizations or provide feedback. The Tableau Enablement Lead focuses on expanding the Red Hat community, tapping into data enthusiasts to lead events, providing training, and offering expertise as an \u201con call\u201d consultant. These activities increased the number of employees\u2014both practitioners and leaders\u2014 using data to guide decisions to a current total of more than 4,500 Tableau users. A broader self-service model coupled with a focus on enabling the community of users and consumers is expected to drive consistency and grow trust in the information shared and consumed. Red Hat\u2019s data sources varied; there were more than 60, including Google Sheets, Excel, and other operations platforms. Together they created noise and made it challenging to uncover critical information. \u201cThat\u2019s at the core of what we\u2019re trying to bring; access to information that matters, as soon as possible,\u201d stated Mandy Elliott, Chief of Staff and Strategy. Migrating workloads to the cloud, they needed a resilient analytics platform that all employees could use, which required little-to-no server maintenance or monitoring. The Enterprise Data and Analytics team was looking to lessen the need to maintain an on-premise deployment because of the staffing, time, and financial resources. As a fully hosted solution, Tableau Cloud required no server configuration so they didn\u2019t have to manage upgrades and the team can seamlessly add users as they grow. The synergy and trust that grew from sharing dashboards on Tableau Cloud created organic analytics growth and tripled the user base. With data in people\u2019s hands, Red Hat has improved its processes, operations, staffing, and customer service. As Mandy summarized, taking these steps of new skill sets, enhanced processes, and better ways of working together, has started to make an impact on the global organization. Red Hat is implementing programs to motivate and change how leaders, managers, and associates approach data. Red Hat\u2019s data literacy program combines product training with specialized curriculum and enablement activities to build up skills like critical thinking and basic data knowledge. They even have a specialized track for data champions, who have the added responsibility to change mindsets and encourage data-informed decision making. \u201cThese data champions will help lift our data culture at Red Hat,\u201d shared Mandy. This commitment is shaping how people approach data at all levels, functions, and locations. Tableau use is closely monitored by the Enablement Lead together with the Enterprise Data and Analytics team. They look at data around dashboard usage from different business units and across regions to inform when and how trainings and community activities are offered and aligned to meet user needs. This usage information also sparks conversations around data insights and observations. To minimize the time and resources previously spent to manually develop weekly, monthly, and quarterly executive reports, the Enterprise Data and Analytics team facilitated development of key performance dashboards in Tableau to increase performance visibility. But first, they worked closely with business leaders across all functional areas to ensure that meaningful data was included and reported accurately. They held personalized adoption workshops with C-suite executives to understand how they use data to help inform the design and content for the dashboards. Upon release of the Executive Dashboard, they saw leaders logging in multiple times each week, sometimes nearly a dozen times a week. They saw an increase in trust in the data, which led to more everyday data use in meetings and in individual work. \u201cTableau provided our data and analytics professionals an avenue to work together more effectively, and we expect the power of those cross-functional insights will aid us in reaching our business goals,\u201d concluded Mandy."

        "title": "Verizon reduces support calls and enhances customer experience with Tableau",
        "company": "Verizon Communications",
        "content": "Verizon Fios offers residential connectivity solutions including broadband Internet, landline voice, and cable TV service delivered over fiber-optics to millions of customers. These services include 6.9 million broadband connections, 4.5 million TV subscribers, and 12.2 million landline phone users\u2014resulting in multiple data sources with billions of rows of data generated (up to 4 terabytes a day), to be managed by the Analytics Center of Excellence team. Put in perspective, that\u2019s nearly half of the Library of Congress collection, totaling 10 terabytes. Verizon\u2019s Analytics Center of Excellence (ACE), a team of more than 80 people, used data science and advanced analytics in the company\u2019s digital, call center, dispatch, marketing, and finance functions to optimize operations and enhance customer experience. They took online and offline data from Hadoop, Teradata, and Oracle, extracted and reduced it to smaller datasets, and then analyzed it in Tableau. This effective approach meant dashboards were in 200+ stakeholders\u2019 hands in time for analysis. Stakeholders ranged from executives to customer-facing call center staff who make better decisions and deliver excellent customer service with daily insights uncovered by Tableau. Using the platform, ACE created more than 1,500 self-serving dashboards that were consumed by operations, business transformation, product development, marketing, and software engineering teams. The interactive dashboards have received 125,000-plus views, with a governed infrastructure that guarantees data is clean and usable. Tableau adoption is on the rise as Fios teams use geo-spatial mapping features to understand location-based impact and analyze text from customer chat sessions, leveraging the Tableau + R and Tableau + Mapbox integrations. These initiatives helped resolve customer service problems and improved customer satisfaction in Fios with fewer calls and service dispatches lowering operational costs. Verizon Fios used manual Excel tables to analyze data like digital and call center metrics. Results were distributed to several teams in static reports. Joining data before analysis also proved tricky with multiple sources to pull from: Oracle, Hadoop, and Teradata. Having limited analytics resources, but a large set of diverse stakeholders to serve, this was an inefficient process that created bottlenecks and redundancies and prevented users from easily digesting data to answer their questions. Gregory McConney, Associate Director of Contact Center Analytics explained how analytics staff \u201cstrive to perform advanced analytics and build predictive models and machine learning solutions that enable the business to move forward...We don\u2019t want to create basic insights when business stakeholders can do that themselves.\u201d Verizon dedicated talent and attention to creating an Analytics Center for Excellence (ACE). The 80+ person team has nearly 30 members who perform analysis in Tableau and deliver insights to key stakeholders. Other members support data governance, data prep, and modeling before handing off to Tableau developers and server administrators. \u201cThe first thing we do is structure the data correctly for it to scale and be automated. We put a lot of thought on structuring the data right and building views on top that will distribute information in the most intuitive way,\u201d explained Sid Dayama, Senior Manager of Data Analytics for Verizon. Before building suites of dashboards, ACE held planning sessions with stakeholders to determine needs. They developed dashboards optimized for fast load times, supporting more effective discussions that transformed how they make decisions from the top down. Once everyone began to embrace the dashboards, the team became more efficient at finding insights with features like tooltips, reflecting details within the visualizations and clarifying field definitions. They look forward to embracing other platform features and using different chart types to further strengthen the customer experience. Customers interact with Verizon\u2019s support team in a few ways\u2014through online chat, call centers, and cross-channel, which means starting in digital channels and ending in a call center. However, Verizon wanted customers to self-serve digitally and avoid the call centers so they don\u2019t have to wait for answers or a tech visit, keeping satisfaction levels high. More importantly, they didn\u2019t want repeated call center contact because that meant a problem was unresolved, producing lower efficiency and higher operational costs within the call center and dispatch teams. Understanding that different segments of customers have varying calling behavior, ACE built an optimized routing solution for certain cohorts of customers, leveraging Tableau dashboards where teams including business transformation, analytics, IT, and call center operations analyzed customer engagement in call centers and monitored call sentiment. The analytics team analyzes 17 different attributes for each individual person in the customer base, looking at tenure of the customer, what products they use, call drivers, how frequently they call, average handling time, call sentiment upon contact, age, and many more. Customers are then categorized and put into different cohorts for treatment. These individual cohorts are then routed to a special support queue where skilled call center representatives handle requests to avoid repeated problems. Tableau dashboards arm the call center reps with contextual information such as historical calling patterns of the customers they are handling so they can resolve issues effectively and reduce the need for customers to call multiple times. The team used the alerts feature in Tableau to notify them when the call volume goes down below the conditional visual threshold. And when it does, an algorithm is activated to reveal new sets of high-request customers and trigger a new customer list for the representatives. \u201cIt's basically taking the human element out of all of this, which is amazing,\u201d explained Greg. Having situational awareness of the customers calling behavior and operational capacity for call center staff, Verizon improved their effectiveness when handling customer calls, reduced the number of repeated calls, and achieved a 43 percent reduction in call volume. Tableau dashboards also reduced customer service analysis time by 50 percent with quicker resolution of customer issues. The dashboards are used by high-level managers to develop strategy as well as stakeholders on the front lines who answer calls daily and need to identify calling behaviors, patterns, and historical trends. In Verizon Fios, there have been certain households that require multiple dispatches to their homes to resolve issues. In order to help reduce the need for multiple dispatches and improve customer satisfaction the ACE team built a suite of Tableau dashboards that helps dispatch teams monitor a geographical impact of field technician dispatch activity not only at the state and zip code level, but also at the individual household level. The dashboards analyzed dispatch activity for 6.9 million Fios customers and included KPIs such as number of tickets generated, ticket rate, dispatches initiated, overall dispatch rate\u2014and also investigated the cost impact from these dispatches. Users could further slice and dice these KPIs by dimensions such as the type of customer, the different trouble types driving dispatches, and several other wireline infrastructure attributes. Mapping features in Tableau, like the Mapbox integration, allowed the team to identify a location-based impact through heat maps and revealed where ticket and dispatch rates over-performed or under-performed and what variables led to the frequent dispatches. Consequently, Verizon reduced technician dispatch analysis time by more than 50 percent and discovered how geospatial mapping can support other organizational needs. Verizon Fios launches digital products with the intention of supporting stronger customer engagement. One of those products is the Fios chatbot on Facebook Messenger, released in 2017. This and other products help customers engage with the brand and ask questions. Having analytics and reporting to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) related to acquisition, engagement, customer receptiveness, and product effectiveness is critical. ACE designed KPIs specific to the Fios chatbot and monitored customer adoption and usage. Applying parameters with custom dates in Tableau, they gauged product performance over time\u2014assessing day-to-day, week-to-week, and month-to-month changes. To extract meaning from chat sessions, they also performed text analytics using the Tableau R integration. Text pre-processing was applied to the customers chat transcripts stored as raw string fields in the table to extract categorical keywords. \u201cAll of this is done in R where data is aggregated based on frequency of occurrence of the words. Then I bring it in Tableau and visualize word clouds, allocating color and size to the frequency of the occurrence. This helped a lot in understanding our customer\u2019s mindset while chatting with the bot,\u201d added Sid. The flexibility of Tableau helped ACE, the digital, and customer service teams track responses for each category of questions that customers ask the bot. The extracted information was used to train the bot\u2019s intelligence so it recognizes more questions and responds appropriately to solve issues. With this knowledge, they also learned the most popular times for customer engagement and increased staff to handle high-volume service events like power outages or pay-per-view sporting events on Fios TV. It was Verizon\u2019s first time integrating R with Tableau. But seeing positive outcomes, like company executives understanding overall customer response to a product launch or using insights to inform product marketing and planning, encouraged Verizon to integrate other sources with Tableau. To further scale analytics adoption, ACE also leverages Python models in Tableau with TabPy."

        "title": "UNC Health identifies long-term changes from its COVID-19 response",
        "company": "UNC Health",
        "content": "UNC Health is a healthcare system comprising 11 hospitals and hundreds of clinics across North Carolina. Using data reported by the New York Times in late April 2020, several national studies identified North Carolina as a growing risk area or potential \u201chot spot\u201d for the COVID-19 pandemic. As a public health system, UNC Health focuses on its mission of improving the health and wellness of all North Carolinians. To that end, it developed a system-wide data and analytics strategy to better understand and respond to patients' needs. The COVID-19 pandemic led UNC Health to accelerate that strategy. \u201cThroughout the pandemic, health data has been a primary driver in nearly all policy decisions at every level of government,\u201d said Jeff Fuller, Executive Director of Analytical Solutions. \u201cBecause we support our state's hospital system, our analysts and data scientists are laying the groundwork necessary for responding to the current crisis and to future unforeseen events.\u201d Maintaining a high level of care and trust with North Carolinians requires UNC Health to be strategic with its data analytics. When the COVID-19 pandemic started, analytics teams rapidly created new dashboards in Tableau, starting with reports for executives and leadership teams. Within just a few weeks, the teams' focus shifted from pandemic management to the rapid creation of sustainable new tools that supported data transparency and better data-driven decision making. During the first weeks after pandemic response began, UNC Health scaled up these efforts to provide updates for more than 30,000 internal users. Data helped teams and individuals align to a common mission, created an organizational shift in healthcare data modeling, and reassured stakeholders that UNC Health was prepared to meet rapidly changing needs. The dashboards showcased data on testing, utilization, PPE inventory, available bed space, and supply chain vulnerabilities. Among other uses, clinical teams and hospital administrators used the data to rank vulnerability for patient cases and manage care delivery priorities. With new data-driven operations underway, UNC Health saw that some of the operational changes would fundamentally change certain post-pandemic operations. The organization had developed a 2019 strategic plan that called for gradual data transformation using pre-pandemic financial and operational models. COVID-19 accelerated new technology uses and new kinds of collaboration\u2014changes that will persist even after things return to so-called normal. According to Jeff, these changes include how UNC Health incorporates analytics and data-driven decision making into daily operations. \u201cWe have to feel comfortable taking 'COVID-19' off the label of these new learnings, because the ways we've been forced to innovate have provided valuable new ways to look at our business, including how we deliver better health outcomes overall.\u201d UNC Health is synthesizing its learnings from their COVID-19 experience to create new models based on these new assumptions. Examples include the blending of forecast models to account for key pandemic management criteria, such as new capacity management, patient confidence, and key supply-side metrics. To respond to the rapidly changing pandemic landscape, care teams demanded and grew accustomed to data transparency through real-time or daily reporting. This will be a permanent improvement to the pace and prominence of making data-driven decisions. Similarly, Health System BI Analyst Chris Paolini shared that \u201cbefore COVID-19, we were looking back at financials and other KPIs on a monthly basis. But now there's a need for daily and weekly reporting. We need to look at things on a real-time basis so our leaders can make decisions faster. I don't see that going away.\u201d For example, analytics leaders are working with surgeons on how to predict surgical procedures going forward. \u201cWe're taking into consideration constraints and limitations around PPE, staffing, and new protocols for making sure our patients are safe,\u201d said Jeff. \u201cWe have to be able to always be two weeks ahead of ourselves to understand what's happening.\u201d Tableau provides the ability to try several different variables in a 'what-if' scenario analysis. For example, Jeff explained, \u201cif we reached 70% of normal operations, how quickly would we burn down our PPE supply? What would our reserves be for a potential future surge? We need to manipulate these factors to see different scenarios, and we're able to do that in Tableau.\u201d COVID-19 has also been a catalyst for UNC Health's pivot to telemedicine. The organization had plans for implementing more virtual experiences for patient care, but the pandemic accelerated their move in this direction. Between March and the end of May 2020, UNC Health provided more than 154,000 virtual appointments to its patients, and saw a significant increase in utilizing 24/7 virtual urgent care and inpatient consults. Using telemedicine, UNC Health met patients' needs while ensuring a safe environment for both patients and staff. Expanding telehealth options has also become an opportunity to build trust with patients in new ways. Consulting remotely during times when in-person appointments were not available helped to reassure the public that UNC Health was able to deliver appropriate health solutions, as patients could consult with providers even when clinics were closed. This rapid shift to telemedicine has also helped to set expectations that such virtual forms of care could become more commonplace in the future. The dramatic increase in telehealth since early March, according to Chris, \u201cis a level of ramp up we've never seen before, for any service. It's been tremendous. We built a telehealth dashboard in Tableau that shows the impact of telehealth on the revenue cycle, and now we can more easily see a significant amount of telehealth billing that we didn't see before the pandemic.\u201d At UNC Health, pursuing modern healthcare operations as a data-driven culture has never been more important. The organization takes pride in being a regional and national authority on healthcare analytics. Over recent decades, it has built expertise to become a leader in proactive, innovative healthcare throughout the state and across the country. UNC Health is also one of many Tableau customers leading through change by using COVID-19 data to make critical decisions confidently and quickly.

        "title": "100,000+ Providence caregivers improve care, reduce patient costs with Tableau",
        "company": "Providence Health & Services",
        "content": "Providence St. Joseph Health is a 51-hospital system with 100,000-plus caregivers who deliver high-quality, cost-effective healthcare to millions of patients annually. Patient data resides in many systems, including electronic medical records (EMRs). As Providence continues to expand, managing and integrating the ever-growing volume of data is a top-of-mind challenge. Providence needs a holistic understanding of patient health and satisfaction levels, cost of care, patient-reported outcomes, and other data to optimize quality of care as well as improve the patient and provider experience. Prior to adopting Tableau, analysts were producing different versions of the same analytics for key performance indicators (KPIs), but the dashboards lacked important qualities: statistical discipline, comparative hospital or regional data, process measures and data on cost. As a first step, Providence identified the universal problems that could be solved with data, creating unified views to highlight best practices and help reduce waste. Wasteful practices included using unnecessarily costly supplies and medications which can drive up the cost per patient case and make healthcare less affordable. Using the Tableau platform, Providence built dashboards accessible to the entire hospital system, displaying detailed quality data and cost data. The dashboards allow practitioners and clinicians to see analytics that pertain to every hospital, clinician and individual nursing unit. This data transparency has been associated with substantial improvements in quality measures and large reductions in cost of care. Keeping up with the needs of an expanding healthcare organization requires analyzing complex data (including hundreds of KPIs) and producing actionable insights that support better quality of care. But within Providence\u2019s dispersed network, different performance reports were saved in different places. This made it difficult for providers to see all relevant data, or use the data to collaborate and make better decisions. Complicating matters, many doctors approach healthcare data with skepticism. They question whether EMR data is adding value to their practice and if the analysts know medicine well enough to make EMR data meaningful. That\u2019s why Providence created the Chief Medical Analytics Officer position and hired Dr. Ari Robicsek to oversee clinical data analysis to improve patient care, treatment affordability, and the healthcare experience. The system-level clinical analytics team, led by Ari, builds and implements Tableau dashboards and other analytics tools for system-wide clinician use. The team includes people with working knowledge of the specific needs of clinicians: physicians who oversee cost of care versus outcomes of care measurement and tool development; nurses who translate between the clinical, analytics, and technical teams to ensure the analytics work and results are relevant to all clinicians; and biostats staff with deep, healthcare-related, data analytics experience. Regional and hospital-specific analytics teams exist in addition to this central analytics team, resolving local problems. Using Tableau, Ari\u2019s team created relevant, contextual dashboards that Providence clinicians and other staff can use to explore and understand quality of care metrics. These dashboards replaced reports that weren\u2019t intuitive or adaptable, eliminating the inefficiencies associated with static reports. Users can also subscribe to additional dashboards that influence the work of specific doctors, nurses, and hospital units. Optimizing patient data with other care metrics, Tableau helped Providence see what works and what doesn\u2019t across all their hospitals. Now they can identify the biggest opportunities to maximize value and cut out waste using a single, integrated platform. Ari adds, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen really meaningful moving of the needle on the difficult-to-improve quality outcomes across the system and I believe part of that is because we\u2019re all speaking a common language.\u201d Currently, Providence is testing Tableau integration with its EMR environment so clinicians can consume analytics in the same place that they spend most of their day and capture all data from patient charts. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, more than $3 trillion a year is spent on healthcare and approximately one third of that is waste. Providence was determined to reduce its own wasteful practices, and at the same time lower costs and improve patient care using Tableau. But highlighting data isn\u2019t enough to convince physicians to change their behaviors. The analytics team needed an innovative, data-informed approach. With Tableau, Providence analyzed data and revealed wasteful practices to clinicians. Knee surgeons often opted for antibiotic-impregnated bone cement to prevent patient infections, which cost three or four times more per patient. Providence analyzed thousands of patients who had antibiotic impregnated and regular cement to see if materials made a difference with infection rates in first-time knee replacements, and they didn\u2019t. By not using unnecessarily costly material in as many replacements, Providence cut hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year from the 10,000 procedures performed and reduced bone cement cost per case by $76. A similar approach with other items resulted in an overall cost per case reduction by $297 in the first year of this work. Doctors don\u2019t want to increase costs for their patients unnecessarily, so when the Providence surgeons were shown the data and the financial impact of their choices, they were appreciative and hungry for more information. By collecting data, analyzing it, and sharing it in a more organized way, Providence now makes it easier for doctors to understand what behaviors positively or negatively impact patient care. It is now bending the cost curve downward or keeping it flat across all patient costs and clinical areas for its 51 hospitals, even in the face of inflationary pressures. Across 10 clinical conditions, Providence has reduced cost of care by $20 million in the first year of these efforts. Providence data sources are complex, including Premier, Press-Ganey, Epic, and more. Before Tableau, analysts coded their own visualizations using data from these sources, and different dashboards were used by different user groups across the hospital network. These were cut and pasted into lengthy PowerPoint or PDF reports that were saved to local servers, making it difficult for clinicians to share analyses and performance metrics for the benefit of patients, the practice, the hospital, and Providence. Likewise, local and regional hospital leadership, corporate executives, and the Board of Directors at Providence struggled with getting a consolidated, high-quality view of the organization\u2019s performance. By gaining corporate leadership support of Tableau from the beginning, Providence\u2019s local and regional hospital leaders as well as clinicians took cues and quickly saw value in using the platform. Consistency was also required by the Board of Directors; by making an enterprise shift to Tableau, Providence gained one visual data language for leaders and frontline providers to assess quality of care. In fact, many of the metrics used to determine executive bonuses are now based on Tableau dashboards. To take enterprise transparency and data analytics to the next level, Providence is shifting from data monitoring and reduction of cost per case in certain clinical scenarios (e.g. joint replacement, spinal fusion, coronary bypass surgery) to all conditions cared for across its hospital network. \u201cI\u2019m excited about expanding some of the value work we\u2019ve been doing and we\u2019re working hard to build the platform that will allow that to happen,\u201d Ari explains. Analytics is also pre-baking statistics into the ETL process, and Providence has started using Tableau R integration for more flexibility with data parameters and filtering so the statistical significance in the data translates through to all physicians."

        "content": "The Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center is a combined statutory public health entity and health service provider serving more than 700,000 residents of Lake County, a suburban area of Chicago and the third most populated county in Illinois. When the Health Department implemented Tableau Cloud in 2017, adoption was slow, mostly due to data limitations: With more than 20 disparate data sources and 36 different applications tracking everything from patient data and community events to behavioral health and infectious disease, Tableau users struggled to access the data required for making strategic and tactical decisions that would drive the organization forward. The department came up with a strategic plan to centralize its analytics activities, drive self-service analytics so all employees could make informed decisions based on relevant data, and curate highly visible reports that would help drive organizational improvement. Previous methods for producing these reports required intensive allocation of engineering, computing, and planning resources. By implementing Tableau Server and using Tableau Prep Conductor, part of Tableau's Data Management Add-on that automates data flow scheduling and enables easy flow monitoring and administration, the department reduced the burden of creating and managing the reports to the point that they now require almost no resources to maintain. This frees up time for patient care teams, creating opportunities for them to help more patients in the communities they serve. A key advantage of this streamlined reporting process is that it enables faster decision-making and data project development. Shrinking production time and rapidly delivering new solutions to user requests builds user confidence in the process and in utilizing data to help them do their job. This, in turn, helps fuel productivity and generate excitement and momentum around analytics that fosters a robust data culture within the organization. Over two years, Tableau adoption at the Lake County Health Department has expanded from 35 to more than 450 users and continues to grow. Critical Tableau visualizations like the productivity dashboard, agency financial dashboard, and clinical quality dashboard support daily decision making across a variety of roles. For example, the process of allocating limited resources for programs serving low-income residents and communities requires clear access to data. By interfacing with Tableau and Prep Conductor, the department can extract the right insights from its various data pipelines and visualize its options for how to approach the problem. In this way, building a trusted, committed data community within the health department translates into meaningful change within the community as a whole. Update (May 2020): Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic, the Lake County Health Department has worked tirelessly to provide up-to-date, reliable data, via Tableau dashboards, to local healthcare systems and government officials. They have used Tableau dashboards to maintain situational awareness, make decisions on community interventions, and communicate with the public.

They soon realized they needed more mindshare to sort through all this data to find meaning and make impact. But rather than expanding the team just for this project, they turned to Tableau, which kept the team nimble and able to make complex decisions fast\u2014without the guesswork. They were able to focus on analyzing data that told the collective story of their customers, and ultimately achieved desired results for their new banking portal."

        "title": "Front Health improves clinical quality and total cost of care with Tableau",
        "company": "Front Health",
        "content": "Front Health was born out of Midwest Health Collaborative (MHC), a consortium of Ohio-based health systems, to offer data-driven clinical transformation capabilities that help providers and payers succeed in value-based care. Front Health has a goal of creating and sharing analytics that will help lower total cost of care and improve the health of patients. To date, automated, on-demand analytics through Tableau have helped health systems manage patient quality and cost across 45 hospitals, 1,900 care sites, 17,000 multi-specialty providers, and more than 500,000 patients. Front Health began by providing valuable ad hoc analyses from financial and clinical data to health systems. In order to scale their work and provide more insights to more users, Front Health adopted Tableau as its embedded analytics platform. The organization paired clinical expertise with data-driven insights to create maximum value for health systems. Appplying user-driven design to the development of a holistic suite of resources, Front Health provided a one-stop shop for value-based care insights, which are useful to many different stakeholders. Users encompass the entire spectrum of provider roles\u2014from clinical and financial executives creating revenue-maximizing strategies to physicians and care managers executing those strategies through patient interaction. Tableau has assisted in generating more than $1,000,000 in annual operation savings for Front Health by automating manual efforts and expanding resource bandwidth. Using Tableau, Front Health has deepened provider engagement across a number of population health initiatives. With data-driven insights in hand, providers now make decisions that boost contract performance, decrease per member per month spending trends, and improve patient quality and key contract metrics. Front Health has also extended its user-focused design process to its consultancy and more public-facing work, showcasing dashboards through Tableau Public. Front Health consultants previously accessed clinical and claims information manually, performing data preparation and analysis in Excel and delivering results to health systems in PowerPoint. \u201cThis delivery method wasn\u2019t streamlined for users or Front Health,\u201d explained Joshua Smith, Creative Director, Analytics at Front Health. Front Health employed a user-driven approach as it created several analytics products and two philosophies influenced their deployment: understanding users and their decision-making, and joint ideation and development. The analytics team wanted the end product to be part of the user\u2019s existing workflow and to offer an intuitive interface that combines data and insights, making it easier for them to act on the insights. Josh and his team took these steps to understand users\u2019 goals, obstacles, and the action space\u2014meaning the levers they can pull to achieve their goals\u2014and involved them in the dashboard design process. This included: As Josh explained, \u201cThere\u2019s this beautiful back and forth where we learn more about them, their business, and pain points. But they also learn from us, and what the tradeoffs are for each visual.\u201d One design session even involved a stakeholder jumping in with a marker and creating their own wireframes, and having that level of engagement \u201cis an eye-opening moment as a designer.\u201d To that end, Tableau\u2019s flexibility to pull from different data sources and mold to health systems\u2019 different needs\u2014whether the user is a clinician or experienced analyst\u2014resulted in a streamlined data analytics product with an intuitive framework. With Tableau-driven reporting, Front Health now provides clients with the key clinical and claims data they need to make valuable decisions. The three key areas analyzed and reflected in different Tableau dashboards are total cost of care, quality and risk adjustment, and care management. Explanations for these dashboards, and the use cases they solve for include: Front Health will soon grow its dashboard collection to include physician, pharmacy, and chronic condition scorecards, performance benchmarking, and social determinants intervention. This will enhance the value Front Health delivers clients and support clinical and system performance improvements that make the goals of lower cost and better quality of care attainable for providers and the patients they treat. Reports and dashboards that require the users to exit their natural workflows for a manual and isolated experience is disruptive to executives and providers. It removes them from the moment where they should focus on important strategic and tactical decisions and requires them to spend energy and time thinking about how the data analytics product works. All Tableau-powered dashboards that Front Health manages and provides clients through its comprehensive consulting services are organized in an architecture that aligns with the decision map it collected. This ensures users intuitively follow a workflow aligned with their needs. That framework is mapped along strategic versus tactical and clinical versus financial axes, and each dashboard has its own distinct spot and purpose; this guarantees updates and new dashboards fit within a holistic framework and users aren\u2019t overwhelmed with hastily developed analytics. Furthermore, it provides users with a streamlined workflow and serves as a map for access rights. \u201cEach dashboard provides those crumbs, like Hansel and Gretel going through the forest\u2014all of them providing steps that get you to those final questions and answers that move you closer to areas of opportunity,\u201d said Joshua. And Front Health has seen the impact that automated analytics in Tableau created in supporting population health initiatives for more than 500,000 patients. Collaboration in developing dashboards and the improved user experience collectively created deeper engagements with Front Health clients. This is apparent in positive user feedback where they express excitement in seeing areas of waste for their health system, what triggers it, and how they can analyze evidence-based measures to help get rid of it. Seeing Tableau\u2019s value in powering the Front Health analytics platform to lower total cost of care and improve patient health, the organization is now applying analytics internally and externally to other key areas. It\u2019s also using Tableau Prep and seeing significant organizational efficiencies. Before, complicated data management was handled by data engineers who juggled too much work. But now, anyone performing analysis can do most data prep work themselves, which frees up data engineers to do more strategic work and allows analysts to be more innovative. Front Health is also elevating its consultancy work with its successful design strategy process and framework to help clients maximize their Tableau value. Front Health brings a creative, user-focused path that pairs clients\u2019 IT and business strategies for easily interpreted, user-friendly analytics. Some of the company\u2019s work is showcased in a collection of dashboards on Tableau Public. Front Health has seen strong reception and enhanced credibility through its Tableau Public portfolio, and even won Visualization of the Day with The Health Risk of Where You Live. It covers a wide spectrum of analytics\u2014machine learning, predictive analytics, and data sourcing\u2014as Front Health shines light on a topic with global impact. Plus, using a simple design made complex data about social determinants of health easier to understand."

        "title": "Marketing agency Tinuiti centralizes data sources, scales marketing analytics",
        "company": "Tinuiti",
        "content": "Tinuiti, North America\u2019s largest independent performance and data-driven digital marketing agency with more than $1 billion in managed ad spend, develops strategic media plans for more than 500 clients. Brands such as Tommy Bahama, Eddie Bauer, and Brooks Running rely on Tinuiti to combine channel data analytics and marketing science with an integrated media strategy. However, a complicated landscape of marketing technologies and data sources made it difficult for Tinuiti to quickly analyze information so that media is fully optimized for one-to-one client marketing. Tinuiti adopted Tableau, helping staff make sense of all channel-level data and reducing time spent on data reporting, collection, and preparation by 60 percent. They centralized data from more than 100 sources with the help of ChannelMix by Alight Analytics and created a scalable, repeatable, cost-effective, and automated reporting infrastructure through Tableau, which satisfies customer needs, increases staff and analytics effectiveness, and enhances client relationships. With the Tableau platform, including Tableau Prep, the Tinuiti analytics team quickly pulls data from a complex mix of digital channels and creates custom, flexible dashboards for customers so they see the full story of their brand efforts. They also deliver bespoke and templated reports so clients\u2019 marketing departments can self-explore data, investigate underlying details, and make better decisions that improve brand engagement. Tableau connects to cloud-hosted marketing data in Amazon Redshift, and provides performant, secure dashboards for both customers and Tinuiti teams so questions and needs are addressed immediately. In-turn, marketing budget is allocated to the best media tactics that create the strongest engagement. With so many marketing sources, Tinuiti was overwhelmed trying to ingest, clean, combine, and provide actionable data reports to its customers. The agency used a painstaking manual process to pull and transform information, but struggled to put timely, dynamic marketing reports in customers\u2019 hands, which also increased the burden to analytics staff, resulting in over 156,000 hours spent on data reporting annually. Customers wanted near real-time analytics, and without it, marketing resources couldn\u2019t be directed at timely multi-channel tactics. Tinuiti adopted Tableau and found instant value with Tableau Prep. Tableau Prep cut the time Tinuiti spent cleaning, combining, and shaping their data all while increasing capacity of the channel and analytics teams. Powered by APIs connected to Amazon Redshift that extract almost 600GB of cloud-hosted marketing data, Tinuiti has created an automated reporting Prep flow that uses clean data from major marketing platforms for functions such as automated email attachments, social media, and digital advertising. \u201cFor us to have access to a tool like Tableau Prep has given us the ability to go faster and do it at scale across multiple channels,\u201d explained Andrew Richardson. And now with Tableau Prep Conductor, the Tinuiti teams are able to schedule and manage self-service data preparation at scale, Andrew shared: \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to try it and expect it will help us automate and scale data prep across the company even more than we have today.\u201d They recognize it will speed up their ability to report on campaigns for clients, increasing the value provided, which also helps their bottom line. The new approach using a combination of ChannelMix and Tableau for automated, flexible, and scalable data analysis allows Tinuiti to deliver strategic value that nurtures strong, lasting client relationships. Clients such as Big 5 Sporting Goods recognize that having this comprehensive view of their channel marketing data greatly impacts their business and enables better spend of their marketing dollars. There\u2019s considerable nuance to marketing campaigns and data reporting. Each marketing tactic requires careful consideration and planning with varying KPIs and goals. Tinuiti understands that not every customer is analytically-minded and data savvy, but it was also challenging with a smaller analytics staff to serve the different channel teams and easily answer customers\u2019 questions. Some of their complex questions included: what\u2019s the lifetime value of our customers, what segments should I go after, or how can I predictively forecast for the future when I\u2019m used to making decisions with gut feel? Tableau\u2019s drag-and-drop functionality and multiple data filters made it easier for Tinuiti\u2019s analytics team to accelerate work in areas that weren\u2019t possible before. With a vast number of ecommerce clients, Tinuiti created a flexible dashboard for them and its internal teams where anyone can adjust the profile, report name, type of chart, timeframes, and other parameters to compare data; it\u2019s often available right after they start with Tinuiti. The analytics team also created a pacing report where channel teams monitor digital advertising budgets for brands so they can monitor daily spending rates and track over and under-spending. Even Tinuiti staff who weren\u2019t considered data experts now clamor to get Tableau and perform their own analysis instead of relying on the analytics team. And with all dashboards hosted in the cloud, always on and available 24/7, internal and client staff (including executives) can check on their digital marketing data whenever they choose. As Andrew explained, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have Tableau, we would be behind where we are today and need more staff to do the same amount of work.\u201d These consumable, dynamic dashboards are \u201cmaking a really big difference for us and our customers.\u201d Now, Tinuiti can focus more on telling the interesting stories behind clients\u2019 multi-channel data and deliver more value. The marketing landscape changes too quickly and both customers and the Tinuiti teams that serve them can\u2019t wait on quarterly updates to make better business decisions. \u201cWe ended up choosing Tableau because of the efficiency that we gained with dashboarding as well as what we were going to see in data exploration,\u201d said Andrew. In fact, generating analytics on the spot\u2014both in preparation for and during client meetings\u2014means Tinuiti can better collaborate with and influence clients by having one source of truth that\u2019s easy to understand, manage, and leads to better customer outcomes. Brooks Running, another Tinuiti customer, lauded how their use of Tableau creates business value for them: \"The Tinuiti team has gone above and beyond to create dashboards that are not only actionable but also beautiful by design! The analytics team has been a pleasure to work with throughout the process and even helped us learn and grow in our own Tableau knowledge. We very much appreciate their hard work and expertise as the dashboards have helped take our business to the next level.\u201d Tinuiti has a marketing science team that uses Tableau forecasting to perform predictive analytics for clients, looking out at least six months. When clients head into annual planning, the agency is prepared with a report showing the year ahead based on historical analysis. This can be applied to display, email marketing, paid social and search, and more. Eventually, Tinuiti has plans to build in predictive analytics at scale so forecasting is part of every client dashboard built. What-if analyses are another concentration for Tinuiti as they expand their capabilities. Leveraging the power of Tableau and integration with R has also allowed for better, time series analysis and media forecasting in conjunction with these what-if analyses. In Tableau, they can answer client questions like \u201cIf I had more money to give you, what would that look like?\u201d Plus, with past data reflected in the analytics, clients and Tinuiti staff have the option to compare actual sales with forecasted sales and adjust results by changing new business growth and expected customer churn rates."

        "title": "JetBlue uses Tableau Cloud and Snowflake to drive upskilling and sustainability programs company-wide",
        "company": "JetBlue",
        "content": "JetBlue is well known in the travel and transportation industry as an affordable, customer-friendly commercial airline. Based in New York, with more than 100 domestic and international destinations and a current ranking as the sixth largest U.S. airline, JetBlue thrives on a potent blend of great people and superior technology. As recent economic challenges have wreaked havoc in the travel market, JetBlue deftly upgraded its technology and upskilled its people to remain active and competitive \u2014 all without losing sight of its sustainability goals, including a goal to reach Net Zero by 2040, ten years ahead of the rest of the airline industry. The airline uses Tableau Cloud to support its multiple lines of business, including sales and marketing, customer service, system operations, and IT. Cloud-scale data analytics empowers organizations to improve and grow their business and achieve their mission while saving time and money. At JetBlue, Tableau Cloud helps drive growth on several distinct fronts: The efficiency gained from these investments also had a positive impact on users\u2019 workloads by reducing time spent on unnecessary tasks. \u201cThrough using Tableau Cloud, we\u2019ve been able to eliminate a great deal of duplicate work, which has made our people much more self-sufficient,\u201d said Clements. \u201cWhen you combine this with our lower maintenance costs from being cloud-based, the cost and time savings have been substantial. And freeing up work cycles has led to opportunities for driving changes in our business based on the data we see and the ability to make different decisions that have a meaningful impact.\u201d Performing an economic recovery while doubling down on analytics investments was no easy task. Chris Gottlieb, Business Intelligence Manager at JetBlue, said it all boiled down to achieving ROI that was previously untapped within the company\u2019s people and data resources. Using data to drive the recovery is a matter of finding and realizing operational and resource gains that were previously hidden from view. \u201cA lot of our recovery success has come from finding new opportunities for efficiency,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cTake fuel efficiency, for example. At a thousand flights per day, if we can find a way to lessen the weight of each plane by 100 pounds, we can save the fuel needed to carry 10,000 pounds in the air each day, all day, 365 days per year. Analyzing data in our Tableau dashboards leads us to discovering those chances to save.\u201d The impacts of these changes, Gottlieb said, can lead to whole new areas of growth. \u201cWhen you tweak one thing to get a better ROI, that\u2019s money you can put into adding more pilots, more routes, more cities. These are the capacity measures that are enabling us to bounce back from hard times.\u201d As always, an analytics platform is only as successful as the data it relies on, and at JetBlue, the legacy systems were fragmented, siloed, and from a variety of providers. The company needed a way to untangle this web and provide a unified pipeline for data that all users could depend on, using trusted data and established shared metrics. Once again, the solution was in the cloud: connecting Tableau Cloud to Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that now serves as the authoritative repository for all curated data sources in the JetBlue environment. \u201cAll of this transformation with the people and analytics wouldn\u2019t have been successful without a solid underlying data platform,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cWe took all of the data sources we had on-premises and put them into Snowflake to create a single source of truth for all analytics at the company.\u201d Centralized access to Snowflake means that teams running Tableau Cloud anywhere at the company \u2014 flight dispatch, fuel management, or any other department \u2014 can draw insights for their own business purposes without worrying about making assumptions that might be incompatible with work done by other teams. The key to growing data analytics competency and adoption rapidly across the JetBlue workforce was to upskill all employees and provide ongoing support to those who needed extra help. \u201cWe actually didn\u2019t focus much on success stories at first. We wanted to know where people were being unsuccessful, so we could help them out,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cWe\u2019d sit with them and create a visualization or help them with any other areas they were stuck.\u201d This approach helped familiarize employees with Tableau, transforming and empowering them to become more data-driven in their work. Gottlieb\u2019s team also added multiple other methods of support, including monthly calls, an issue tracking system with follow-up protocols, and a community Teams channel called JetBlue Insights Network, or JIN. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve really created now is a learning culture at JetBlue,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cOur analysts and BI leadership truly listen to what our community needs, down to the last team and individual. When you listen, you can teach, and you can learn.\u201d Leading the way in JetBlue\u2019s critical transformation to a more data-centric culture was Tableau\u2019s easy-to-learn, easy-to-use interface. \u201cOur previous analytics solution wasn\u2019t very intuitive,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cWe could spend up to 20 hours showing a single person or team the best way to derive value from a simple calculation. Tableau Cloud changed all that. If it hadn\u2019t been so easy to use, we might never have succeeded at getting everyone on board.\u201d Once Gottlieb\u2019s team began training users on Tableau Cloud, adoption soared. \u201cIt was just so quick \u2014 everyone caught on really fast,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like installing new equipment. It was just Tableau Cloud, right there: Here\u2019s the link, here\u2019s your single sign-on, now start dragging and dropping to create the tools you need. We knew we made the right decision on Tableau Cloud when we saw more and more people using it in their everyday job.\u201d This adoption wave reached every business unit at the company. For example, the airline\u2019s systems operations center (SOC) is currently modernizing and combining three major data platforms: the crew management system, which assigns crews to flights; the aircraft movement system, which assigns flights to aircrafts; and the flight planning system, which generates flight plans for the pilots. To build this complex, newly integrated platform, JetBlue uses Tableau Cloud to both push information to crews and also display dashboards where the dozens of subject matter experts involved with the transition can get critical insights on progress. \u201cOur operations teams have visibility into the business that no one else has because they need to identify issues and communicate them to the right people,\u201d said Lucie Bloom, System Operations Center Managing Director. \u201cTableau Cloud lets us consolidate all of this information into one place and make it relevant to each individual person involved.\u201d"

        "company": "Juniper Networks",
        "content": "Juniper Networks, Inc. is a leading provider of AI networking and intelligent cloud solutions, specializing in routers, automation, software, and cybersecurity. The global company has over 10,000 employees and strives to constantly innovate and adapt to better technologies. Robust and actionable data is key to Juniper's business model and market position. Having quick, easy, and reliable access to high-quality data means that they can be agile and consistently provide top-notch solutions to their enterprise customers. In recent years, the organization has embarked on a multi-year and multi-faceted digital transformation journey, with a key goal being improved data access. They've focused on the digitization of assets and the use of data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to automate processes, increase productivity, and reduce expenses, all while keeping data secure. Juniper implemented Tableau Server several years ago to gain insight into their most important data. But as their data volume, users, and usage grew, running Tableau in their on-premises environment proved to be a challenge. Although Tableau Server provided the company with the freedom to explore data in a trusted environment that was governed and secure, the on-premises server struggled to keep up with ever-increasing internal demand. Juniper's physical servers crashed intermittently, leading to unnecessary downtime, and the company estimates they lost 2,000 hours of productivity per month across their 4,000 internal Tableau users. The business continued to grow, which meant that the need for data analytics continued to grow. Juniper Networks Senior Data Warehouse Architect Suman Shanthakumar explains, \"As the organization grew in terms of data, requirements also grew, got expensive [and we] needed a platform that grew with [our] needs, that would scale.\" As part of their digital and cloud transformation journey, Juniper decided to move to Tableau Cloud. They sought stability and wanted to create an internal cloud culture and improve employee productivity. And importantly, Tableau Cloud ensures data remains safe and secure with end-to-end encryption, but also maintains 99.9% availability across the business. They built a migration and governance roadmap that accounted for analysis, planning and architecture, and created a proof of concept that addressed over 20 critical use cases. They established a framework for content and license governance, and automated license provisioning. To mitigate the complexity of the cloud migration for internal users, the company conducted education sessions with the Tableau Prep tool and leveraged educational materials via Tableau Blueprint. They coordinated with almost 900 content creators and explorers to identify and migrate appropriate content to Tableau Cloud. The investment in moving to the cloud paid off. Juniper has achieved a more reliable, scalable, secure and cost-effective data analytics solution. By thoroughly planning and accounting for their cloud migration, they've been able to take advantage of phenomenal benefits, and ultimately improve their customer experience and overall company growth. Juniper has been able to maximize revenue by using Tableau reports. Jonathan Pflaum, Services Management Senior Director at Juniper Networks, says, \"We have designed a Tableau dashboard in collaboration with our service finance key stakeholders to measure margin across our service lines of business. This dashboard allows us to drill down to the profitability at the customer level, providing valuable insight when constructing large, complex deal pricing and delivery structures. In the past few years, we have broken records in overall margin in the services business.\" From a user standpoint, Juniper teams can now access data insights from anywhere via the Tableau Mobile app, and access to new features and functionality is instant because they no longer have to manually implement new version upgrades. They can leverage that data to make timely, targeted business decisions. Pflaum, explains, \"Five years ago, we had no way to accurately measure renewal rates; service sales teams and partners were flying blind.\" By implementing a dashboard in Tableau Cloud, Pflaum explains, \"[We can] provide this business visibility, slicing data by partner, region, product line, etc. These actionable insights have allowed our service sales teams and partners to achieve world class financial service renewal rates, breaking records two years in a row.\" The organization can now auto-scale as needs require, and Tableau can easily integrate with other cloud-native apps. They've seen a 50% improvement in dashboard performance and an 84% reduction in time spent on upgrades and maintenance. There has been a 90% decline in IT support requests. Meanwhile, they've experienced a 125% increase in the ability to run jobs concurrently. Juniper has experienced over $250,000 in cost savings through license governance and a 90% reduction in license-management resources by employing automated login-based license management. By evaluating and managing access needs, they were able to consolidate dashboards to avoid confusion and ensure that teams are operating off the most up-to-date, business critical analytics, which also resulted in storage and compute cost savings. According to Juniper Manufacturing Operations Senior Manager Subhendu Roy, they've also leveraged Tableau functionality to pass cost-reduction initiatives along to their customers. He explains, \"In today\u2019s cost-conscious environment, in which customers are constantly tightening budgets, the pressure to deliver cost-reduction initiatives is now intense. To increase cost transparency and identify cost savings opportunities, we built Cost Control Tower using Tableau that integrates data from multiple systems. It serves as the 'single source of truth' and provides a common operating picture across different finished products and customer segments.\" By moving to Tableau Cloud, Juniper reports improved data security, but the move to cloud has also enabled the company to identify issues with their supply chain. According to Roy, \"The challenge of supply-chain risk management has been exacerbated by globalization with complex multi-tier dependencies... with more potential failure points and higher levels of risk.\" By using Tableau and other solutions, Roy says they've been able to highlight potential risks and correlated impact to business users. He explains, \"This has helped us in taking steps to act on supply chain risks and working with suppliers to ensure timely availability of materials, and in turn providing products and services to our customers in a timely manner.\" Ultimately, transitioning to Tableau Cloud has helped Juniper achieve a key goal in their digital transformation journey: data accessibility. With fast, reliable access to their data, the company has been able to make informed decisions faster, improve productivity, cut costs, boost their bottom line and manage risk. These advantages provide Juniper with a strong foundation for innovating the AI networking and intelligent cloud solutions of the future."

They have been a prominent part of Major League Baseball\u2019s American League since their establishment in 1972, and were the winners of the 2023 professional baseball championship. In a regular season they play 81 home games annually in a state-of-the-art stadium that holds 40,000 fans. \u201cFans are the lifeblood of our whole organization,\u201d explains Jake Radelet, Manager, CRM & Analytics. \u201cWe want our fans to feel like they're part of the organization. Not that they're just coming to watch the game, but that they're truly part of the team. It\u2019s all about the full experience.\u201d Delivering unique experiences at scale can be a daunting task. Since 2016, the Texas Rangers have sought competitive advantage by giving fans a seamless stadium experience from parking to concessions with their industry-leading data strategy, spearheaded by Tableau. Before investing in Tableau, the Texas Rangers used spreadsheets to store data. This included competitive data to assist with pre-, mid- and post-game performance, as well as back-office data such as ticket sales, inventory and confectionery sales. The Texas Ranger\u2019s business analytics team, consisting of just four people, spent hours manually entering and cross- referencing data from various spreadsheets across the organization to try to draw out insights. With all of this disparate data, making informative and impactful business decisions in real time, across the organization, was almost impossible. Today, the Texas Rangers use Tableau Server to give their fans an incredible experience, on and off the field, by extending the value of their data across the entire organization. This allows business users to access critical data in a single platform, whilst ensuring data remains governed and secure. The Rangers\u2019 business analytics team combines and shapes data from various spreadsheets and external sources faster before publishing new dashboards to Tableau Desktop, allowing users across the organization to access, visualize and analyze data\u2014pre- and mid-game, putting fans at the center of everything they do. During the season fans flock to Globe Life Field, often arriving by car. As they make their way into one of the facility\u2019s 16 parking lots, vehicle entry data is recorded and visualized in a dashboard shown in the Rangers\u2019 gameday operations room. Parking information, and all other gameday data, is updated every 3 to 5 minutes, allowing the Texas Rangers\u2019 Executive VP of Gameday Operations and Guest Experience to pivot their gameday logistics. For example, he is quickly able to tell the ground staff which parking lots have greater capacity, which enables fans to park and enter the stadium as quickly as possible. As fans file into the stadium, the operations team uses Tableau to track how many people are entering through each of the five gates in real time. This is particularly important when Bobbleheads or T-shirts are being given away. Using Tableau, the team is able to reallocate giveaways to busier gates to help maximize the fan experience. Baseball fans who visit Globe Life Field often stop by the service desk to ask questions. To better equip staff with answers, Tableau is integrated into Salesforce Service Cloud, which enables the visualization of the most frequently asked questions and improves communication. This includes updating signage around the stadium and informing gameday briefings with staff around the ballpark, so they can answer fans\u2019 questions quickly and accurately. A key concern that many baseball fans have is being hit by a stray ball. With an average of 46 foul balls per game, the Texas Rangers go to great lengths to keep fans safe. Throughout the course of a season, foul balls and their locations were tracked using Tableau. At the end of the season in question, the Rangers analyzed the data and net coverage to assess where they may need to increase the size of nets, or relocate them, to catch stray balls. Doing so helped to mitigate the risk of injury and ensured fans can focus on enjoying the game. Engaging fans outside the ballpark is imperative, so the Rangers run a brand campaign and are active across social media channels. Using Tableau, the business analytics team slices and dices brand campaign results by gender, age, ethnicity, marital status and more. Doing so allows the Rangers to better understand their fans, their perception of the organization and areas of opportunity to enhance or change those perceptions. On social media, the Rangers use Tableau to monitor engagement rates across their various social platforms to continuously improve performance and engage fans in new ways. Each season, ticket prices are reviewed in depth to ensure the organization continues to receive a steady stream of revenue, and fans are enticed to return to the ballpark. To assist with ticket pricing, the team uses a range of different data points and visualizes them in Tableau to make recommendations. This includes analyzing on-field performance, previous season ticket sales, ticket offer sales, as well as competitive data and much more. This kind of data-driven decision making allows the Rangers to continue to fill Globe Life Field and ensure fans are satisfied. Tableau has helped completely transform the Texas Rangers\u2019 back-office, providing the business users across the organization with a dashboard for almost anything. In fact, data is so ingrained in the culture of the organization that 92% of Texas Rangers employees with authorized access are using Tableau on a regular basis to inform their decisions. With this new level of data literacy and transparency, they can better communicate with and educate staff, helping them stay up to date and make data more digestible. The emergence of AI is proving to be one of the most powerful tools an organization can incorporate into their CRM systems. Using AI, the Texas Rangers business analytics team will be able to take what they know from all of the data collected and make it more relational to the fan. This will provide deeper touch points for how the team can use data to further enhance the fan experience. \u201cAI excites me because it's an untapped world for the Texas Rangers, but it's also an incredibly powerful world,\u201d said Katie Morgan, Vice President, Business Analytics and Ticket Strategy. AI gives the business analytics team a competitive and strategic advantage in how they communicate with their fans and how the experience impacts those fans while they are at the stadium. \u201cAs a smaller team, we often don't have the opportunities to dig into this information quite as much as we want to,\u201d Morgan continued. \u201cWith the power of AI and Tableau AI, we will gain unknown insights that will provide forecasting opportunities and will allow us to reprioritize various goals as needed.\u201d All of the business analytics team\u2019s investments in technology are geared toward providing the best possible experience for each fan. With AI-powered insights from Tableau and Customer 360, the Texas Rangers business analytics team is succeeding in business, rekindling the magic of the ballpark, and gaining even more fan loyalty and love."

        "content": "Mankind Pharma is one of India's largest pharmaceutical companies. The company develops, manufactures, and markets a diverse range of pharmaceuticals as well as consumer healthcare products.It also operates a number of well-known brands in India and has growing operations overseas.\nAs Group CIO of Mankind Pharma, Pramod Gokhale is responsible for the IT strategy and operations of the entire group comprising multiple legal entities. He is responsible for maintaining and keeping the lights on for the business, and also developing the group\u2019s strategy for digital transformation. He brought in Tableau several years ago to help all departments extract more value from data, and to solve the issues of managing data silos and accuracy. To support faster and simpler decision making, Mankind Pharma needed to make data more actionable. This meant getting rid of bottlenecks like manual consolidation. Gokhale and his team chose to deploy Tableau as it offered an easy-to-use solution to connect and visualize previously siloed data. \u201cOne of the differentiators of Tableau is that you can create dashboards without any coding. Once you establish your data structure and set up your data cubes, you can drag and drop objects to create your dashboard,\u201d said Gokhale. Mankind Pharma has worked with Tableau consulting and implementation partner Uneeops to implement Tableau and create close to 135 dashboards. These dashboards combine data from a number of sources to help teams across the company track and manage performance. The dashboards have also reduced reporting time for Mankind Pharma\u2019s Product and Production & Operation teams by more than 50%. Plans to extend Tableau across other teams could automate the company\u2019s analytics by as much as 70%. Gokhale and his team have used Tableau to unlock the value of data for multiple departments. One of these is the finance department which can now combine data from finance and project-related applications for more advanced analysis on invoices and other transactions. Mankind Pharma\u2019s field sales team has also benefited with Tableau dashboards providing them with actionable insights on how they can best meet their monthly targets.  \u201cWe have one of the largest field sales teams in the country and they have always provided us with a lot of information for reporting, but we were not giving them very much data in return. Tableau has helped us to turn this around and empower the team with descriptive and predictive analytics,\u201d said Gokhale.  The dashboards help motivate the field sales team while also supporting the team to stay focused on high-value activities.    Mankind Pharma is currently extending the use of Tableau, with activities including further automation of analytics. Anticipated insights are expected to result in a more focused approach for field sales as well as healthy competition amongst the team.  The company also expects increased productivity and improved supply chain management.  Mankind Pharma has partnered with Uneecops to deliver these results. Building on previous successful projects and Uneecops\u2019 data analytics expertise, the two companies completed the Tableau deployment in record time. "

        "title": "voestalpine\u2019s market-leading High Performance Metals Division launches new products and services to the most relevant customers with CRM Analytics",
        "company": "voestalpine",
        "content": "voestalpine is one of the largest manufacturing companies in Austria, and the High Performance Metals Division is the global market leader in its sector. Unlike its competitors, it offers a full range of products and services to customers from the transport, consumer goods, mechanical engineering, and oil and gas industries. We spoke to Martin Bileck, Global CRM Coordinator of the High Performance Metals Division, to find out how he and the global CRM team are driving data culture across the company, and how it helps voestalpine to stay ahead of the game. Martin: When I joined the team just over four years ago, we were in the middle of our Salesforce CRM rollout. We now have 140 locations across 25 countries, and 1,600 Salesforce users across sales and marketing. It can be challenging to act on a global level and respond to different analytics demands. Everyone needs different data displayed in different ways. Whilst the Salesforce dashboards were great, I knew that CRM Analytics could help us dive deeper and get richer insights from CRM and website data. voestalpine has always been a data, fact, and number-driven company, but was handling numbers with data warehouse & PowerPoint slides. Now it\u2019s time to work with interactive dashboards and real-time data. Martin: The biggest challenge is always user adoption. It\u2019s no good simply building a dashboard and sharing a link. We put a lot of effort into training users on how to use the solution. We ran global webinars on different topics and explained how analytics supports various business cases. Even though CRM Analytics is really user-friendly, it still takes time for people to get used to a new solution. We worked alongside a focus group of 50 people on the marketing team to capture feedback and adapt the solution to make sure it met their needs. Martin: We have 240 global users across sales, marketing, and product development, and that includes front-line staff, sales managers, and managing directors. We realized that people view reports differently in different regions, but CRM Analytics allows us to create dynamic visualizations that can be viewed in lots of different ways. For example, sales managers in Germany prefer to look at orders on a weekly basis, whilst our Asian team check them daily, and North American staff track them monthly. Not having to create 10 different dashboards was a real time saver! And the solution remembers employee preferences, so when they open it, the information is displayed the way they like it. Martin: We have three marketing dashboards: the target group, regional marketing, and leads dashboard. We used to spend hours pulling together contact lists in Excel, but now we can pull contacts based on different criteria for target groups in seconds. The regional marketing dashboard then reports on three key metrics to track performance. We look at how many campaigns were sent, and how many leads they generated, and we can look at those figures over time, by sales company, or globally. Finally, leads are displayed in a simple dashboard to show how many were generated, how likely they are to convert, and which are the hottest leads to focus on. Martin: We\u2019ve got 11 sales dashboards, from the customer 360 dashboard that shows all account-related data in real time, to a visiting dashboard to prioritize and track whom we see in person, and management dashboards. With CRM Analytics we use automated workflows to help people get richer insights from our data. For example, they can generate visualizations for meetings without spending hours of prepping. Managers can tap into relevant metrics in real time and display complex data in a simple way. We\u2019ve made CRM Analytics available from smartphones too, so staff have insights at their fingertips whenever they need them. Martin: It helps the sales and marketing teams to be more aligned and to work smarter, without being highly skilled around analytics. Automating data capture and embedding it in workflows is changing the way we work. Being able to accurately calculate the ROI for each marketing campaign means we can find out the most effective ways of generating leads, for example. We give customers a classification between A and D \u2013 A and B are high-potential customers, and C and D have lower potential. CRM Analytics helps us to visualize where we put our most valuable resources and urges us to focus on the right customers \u2013 it\u2019s not cost-effective for our sales reps to be constantly visiting customers who only purchase one small piece of steel from us, it eats into our profit margin. When we visualize the number of visits and the revenue from the visited customers side by side, we understand why visiting the right customer is so important for the first time. Martin: It helps with upselling and opening new revenue streams. We\u2019re working on forecasting workflows to help sell services as well as products. If a customer buys steel, they may need to send it back to us for a heat treatment. With CRM Analytics, the sales team is proactively notified about those customers and can follow up at the right time to offer those services and send a quote.  We also recently released a dashboard for product managers. We developed a new product line for engineered products \u2013 so we\u2019re not just selling the raw materials and services, we can actually sell components that are ready to use. The team came to me and asked if there was a way to track the new product line, so I created a real-time dashboard to give them 360-degree visibility. Now they can see quotes, orders, product information, customer interests, behavior, and even feedback in one place. Previously, they were capturing that in spreadsheets and charts, which made it complex to analyze. Martin: Real-time insights are already helping us protect our competitive edge. People understand they can use data to get actionable insights, and they can see the impact that has on our business goals. We\u2019re planning to onboard more users \u2013 for example, one dashboard used by sales reps is integrated with a telephony solution to give them analytics during a call. Other teams could benefit from that. When working with analytics has become second nature to our staff, we\u2019ll be looking at Einstein artificial intelligence. I don\u2019t want to overwhelm my colleagues with too much change at once, so we\u2019ll mature our existing dashboards, increase adoption, and then plan the next steps."

        "title": "Data insights in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic helped CVS Health improve readiness, response",
        "company": "CVS Health",
        "content": "CVS Health has largely been well known for its pharmacy locations in neighborhoods across America. However, in the last decade, CVS Health has redefined its mission to become a health solutions-focused company. This has included optimizing the retail environment to serve as a community health destination, with a focus on providing omnichannel, accessible, and affordable health care services via CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic\u00ae locations. Amid this transformation, data and analytics have played a central role in keeping the company agile, strategic, and focused in the right areas for developing strategies to improve the patient journey. The central role of analytics \u2014 including during the global pandemic \u2014 has been part of the ongoing transformation at the company toward a modernized, data-centric culture. \u201cModernization and achieving innovation at scale are critical imperatives for health care, and at CVS Health, the role of analytics has really accelerated over the past couple years,\u201d said Kelly Mok, Director of Retail Analytics Strategy. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed close partner relationships based on data analysis production, we\u2019ve empowered more users with self-service dashboards in Tableau, we\u2019ve built new models that align better with our business, and we\u2019ve increased our focus on using data to improve health outcomes in traditionally underserved communities.\u201d Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, CVS Health was a leader in providing preventative health care at scale, administering more than 10 million flu vaccinations annually in recent years. This was made possible partly due to the company\u2019s extensive physical retail infrastructure: 85% of the US population lives within 10 miles of a CVS pharmacy, helping to position CVS not only as a household brand name, but also as a highly practical resource for reaching communities nationwide. This level of presence, especially in socially vulnerable areas, is also key to improving health equity \u2014 a CVS Health priority. But with such a massive scale of operations, CVS Health needed an organized approach to analyzing data and providing a \u201csource of truth\u201d to enable business and public health solutions. By centrally modeling and analyzing health care data, the company refined the way it managed and supported its vast network of retail locations. When COVID-19 hit, this centralized data model became even more important, serving as a crucial catalyst for CVS Health\u2019s ability to quickly scale its services to urban and rural populations across the US. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, CVS Health has administered more than 58 million COVID-19 tests and more than 78 million COVID-19 vaccines. They accomplished this level of execution by leveraging their position as a data-focused health care company, combining real-time internal data with comprehensive external data to provide critical insights in the face of uncertainty. The combination of real-time analytics insights with widespread geographic reach meant that CVS Health was uniquely positioned to respond to and help combat the health crisis, as well as to shape the national response and ensure that all key initiatives were fast, flexible, and fair. To organize the pandemic response, the Analytics team partnered with key leaders across CVS Health to stand up the data-driven initiatives that underpinned its actions. \u201cEarly on, there was no dedicated team to handle this large-scale effort, so Francois Fressin, Executive Director of Strategic Retail Health Analytics and I ended up forming the initial CVS Health COVID-19 Data and Modeling Center,\u201d said Mok. \u201cWithin the first few days, we received tons of information from external sources. We coupled this with internal CVS data, other external data, and expert feedback to build and synthesize a presentation for leadership about what was actually happening.\u201d What started as a team of two gradually expanded to more than 15 people, focused on collecting data they could integrate into their modeling center\u2019s programmatic response. Over time, the team\u2019s mission grew to include generating insights that would also impact the company\u2019s core business strategies beyond vaccine and COVID test delivery, given the twists and turns the pandemic took in exposing new kinds of issues over time. The complexity of these intersecting requirements meant the team needed to achieve real agility and precision with the data they were tracking and using to model their response. \u201cCVS has been a data-driven company for a while now, but it reached a whole new level during the pandemic, which none of us really expected,\u201d said Fressin. \u201cWe had only a short time to build a whole strategy for providing access to vaccines throughout the US. It had to be done as efficiently as possible, and data was the glue connecting all the pieces.\u201d Mok wholeheartedly agrees, and credits Tableau with playing a key role in facilitating the team\u2019s rapid development activities. \u201cI remember when vaccines were still being tested, and we were all eagerly awaiting their approval,\u201d she said. In a couple of days, we set up a literal mission control room on the CVS Woonsocket campus featuring multiple dashboards that visualized a wide range of CVS and external data.\u201d These decision-enablement capabilities, Mok pointed out, will continue to help CVS Health beyond the current challenges. Adapting CVS Health culture around powerful new analytics capabilities played a critical role in mobilizing and managing vaccine distribution, but also helped position the company for future success, enabling teams to pursue new initiatives for making health care more efficient and accessible. To support its digital transformation, CVS Health utilizes a range of tools such as Salesforce Health Cloud to deliver personalized patient experiences, ultimately driving better health outcomes for CVS Health\u2019s pharmacy patients while reducing operating costs and increasing efficiency. With this unified view of patient data, Mok and her team used Tableau to easily build and enhance dashboards in dynamic ways based on new insights from the data they collected. In this way, CVS Health found better ways not only to serve its customers and its mission, but also to modernize their operations and innovate at scale. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked on stacking our team with talent in different areas,\u201d said Mok. \u201cWe have data engineers who pull the data for us, data scientists with brilliant minds who compile the models and forecasts, and visualization folks that help us synthesize what's happening for our business partners. These visualizations become the key strategic pieces we use for storytelling and driving important decisions.\u201d A key tenet of CVS Health\u2019s data modeling and analysis efforts has been improving the health experience to provide more convenient, equitable, personalized, and affordable care for consumers. Of the more than 78 million COVID-19 vaccinations CVS Health administered in the last few years, over 40% were to underrepresented communities. \u201cThe ability to reach these vulnerable communities has been critical since the beginning,\u201d said Mok. \u201cVaccines were the key for giving them a chance to protect themselves.\u201d Shivaani Prakash, Lead Director of Retail Health Data Science and co-lead of the company\u2019s COVID-19 Data and Modeling Center, agrees. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my whole career in public health, where we\u2019re always trying to design the best interventions for communities who need care the most urgently,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position to make a real difference across communities.\u201d For example, one challenge that arose early on in the availability of COVID-19 vaccines was uncertainty around the quantity of vaccines CVS Health could procure at any given time, or how long it would take to receive them. Using multiple sources of data, the company organized a ranking of stores by state in terms of need, impact, and geographic coverage. As the modeling center team identified areas with higher demand or less accessibility, they could adjust rankings to keep the list updated and ensure that levers such as additional site selection, community partnerships, mobile clinics, and proactive outreach were all deployed accordingly. By using this robust selection algorithm, CVS Health succeeded in optimally and equitably delivering millions of vaccines across all its locations, with limited vaccine waste\u2014and helped position the company to better address and overcome supply chain and distribution challenges in the future. Overall, this level of data-driven organization has furthered CVS Health\u2019s mission of improving health outcomes for its patients and increasing access where it is most lacking.   \u201cIn the past few years there have been so many unknowns,\u201d said Mok. \u201cBut the ways we\u2019ve found for using data have made us stronger, because we can estimate what\u2019s going on and how it\u2019s going to have an impact on our business, as well as on the wellbeing of the individuals and communities we serve.\u201d"

        "title": "Robust upskilling program empowers transformation to a data culture at e-commerce leader Mercado Libre",
        "company": "Mercado Libre",
        "content": "Founded in Argentina and headquartered in Uruguay, Mercado Libre is the most popular online retailer in Latin America with more than 176 million users in 18 countries. Each of its 67 million customers in 2021 averaged 500 visits to the Mercado Libre ecommerce site, purchasing a total volume of over $28 billion in merchandise at a rate of 32 purchases per second. The company employs more than 30,000 people and has operations in countries across the American continents. A Tableau user since 2013, Mercado Libre went from just a few users that first year to more than 12,000 active users today, publishing more than 9,500 workbooks and nearly the same number of data sources\u2014with a 5x increase in Tableau adoption in the past two years alone. During that same interval, the company thoroughly realigned its approach to using data to redefine the way it conducts business in every part of its organization. The level of transformation needed to accomplish this has been a key change agent in how Mercado Libre views its core business, its methods of modernization, its competitive market position, and the quality of its employees\u2019 working lives. \u201cData is most powerful when everyone can use it to enhance not only their job performance but also their overall wellbeing and the world around them,\u201d said Adri\u00e1n Quilis, Senior Director of Data & Analytics at Mercado Libre. \u201cAt Mercado Libre, we prioritize giving our employees access to analysis tools, insights, and on-the-job training to help create and nurture a data-driven culture.\u201d \u201cWe started our current data journey around eight years ago,\u201d said Quilis. \u201cWe had not yet fully implemented Tableau, but we saw what it was capable of doing for us. We had only a few reports being generated by our team, using data from the previous day. We knew we needed to make this scalable, and for that we needed to make some real changes to our overall data strategy.\u201d These strategy changes, Quilis explained, broke down into three main areas: On this last point, culture change, the idea of upskilling was to empower analysts within each business unit to become data experts, so that the \u201clast mile\u201d of analytics knowledge could be achieved. Previously, with all data knowledge centralized in a single team, the act of fulfilling data requests was extremely challenging due to the lack of capabilities within business units to fully understand and adapt to the tools they were given. Today, the process is much smoother and more connected, thanks to the data education that business units have received. The transformation started small but grew fast. Key users in each business unit were trained to become \u201cBI cells\u201d within the company, examining and communicating their teams\u2019 analytics needs and learning Tableau to create the necessary workbooks. But the company grew fast as well, doubling in size between 2014 and 2017 and expanding even more rapidly since then, creating a moving target for bridging the disconnect between the company\u2019s culture and its existing BI strategy. To keep up with the pace of growth and reach new users with training and tools, Mercado Libre needed a manageable approach to achieving scale. At this point, Quilis and the BI team quit trying to do it all on their own, and partnered with the company\u2019s human resources organization to build out a more structured approach. One result was the Data Culture team, whose mission was to centralize and scale up Tableau and data analytics education efforts company-wide. \u201cWe created a Data Culture team within the Data Analytics team,\u201d said Quilis. \u201cThis is a small team, focused on learning and community initiatives. Before that, all of that knowledge was isolated in the BI team, and nobody was really in charge of promoting an actual culture of using data.\u201d The other key result of reorganizing and intensifying the Mercado Libre data transformation efforts at scale was a robust training center. The company created a multi-part, multi-level training curriculum focused on meeting employees wherever they were with their current knowledge of data, and empowering them to make analytics a more meaningful and productive part of their day-to-day work. The team also created a data-driven index that gauged the capabilities of individuals and teams in order to assess needs and track learning progress. The learning paths Quilis and his team created comprise two main curricular areas: self-paced, platform-based learning for individuals; and instructor-led, classroom-based learning for teams. Self-paced learning currently includes the following programs: On the instructor-led side, teams can take classes at varying levels of technicality, from a basic orientation to the languages of data, SQL and Python, to focused sessions on treating business pains with the aid of data and developing your first data analytics or data science project. Advanced teams can take the Data Champion certification course and become official leaders within the Mercado Libre data community. And for beginner teams, the company will soon offer a Data & Analytics track within its existing IT Bootcamp program, a technical orientation to the company for new hires.  The Data Champion course in particular has been instrumental in landing last-mile coverage for the company\u2019s BI education strategy. \u201cWe train these leaders so that they can train their own teams,\u201d said Quilis. \u201cWe made a special effort to identify users who were already intermediate or advanced, so we could foster those skills and interests in them in ways that help elevate knowledge across our whole data culture.\u201d As data culture transforms, companies themselves transform as well\u2014often in ways that are hard to predict. Even in the face of steep growth, or unanticipated disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Mercado Libre has successfully kept pace with change. The proof is in the agility with which the BI and Data Culture teams continue to train and empower the company\u2019s workforce to integrate data into their daily working lives.  \u201cEven though we grew a lot in the past two or three years, we only had to move some pieces in order to adjust our strategy,\u201d said Quilis. \u201cThat\u2019s because we had evolved already as a data culture, so responding to the acceleration in hiring was a natural extension of the plan we already had in place.\u201d"

        "company": "Bentley",
        "content": "Bentley is one of the most recognisable luxury car brands in the world, offering unrivalled levels of craftmanship and detailing in every vehicle it produces. The company sells around 15,000 cars a year globally, each one designed and built to the individual customer\u2019s exact specifications, meaning no two Bentley cars are ever the same.  Following the celebration of its centenary year in 2019, Bentley recently unveiled a brand new transformation strategy \u2013 Bentley100 \u2013 which will serve as its blueprint for success over the next 100 years and beyond. At the centre of this strategy is effective digital transformation and self-service data analytics, using powerful tools like Tableau to empower employees, drive efficiencies and enable faster, more informed decision making at every level of the company.  Bentley originally built its reputation in long distance endurance racing during the 20th century and is now most widely known for its bespoke luxury cars of exceptional quality. However, with the automotive industry currently going through unprecedented change, Bentley recognised the need to transform in order to face current disruptors and ensure its long-term success.  \u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t rest on our laurels,\u201d says Andy Moore, Chief Data Officer at Bentley Motors. \u201cIn order to maintain and build on our hard earned market position, we had to meet new market challenges head on, which required fundamental changes to our business approach.\u201d Part of this involved a commitment to switch to an all-electric portfolio of vehicles by 2030, backed by $3 billion of investment. The other core component was implementing effective digital transformation throughout the company to streamline operations, improve customer service, and cement Bentley\u2019s position as a global automotive leader. \u201cBentley100 is our transformation strategy to take us into our next century,\u201d says Andy \u201cEvery aspect of it is underpinned by data. How we use data, how we communicate with data, and how we take actions based on that data, is all key to our future.\u201d Andy and his team knew a people-led approach was needed for success and quickly identified Tableau as the ideal solution to help them achieve their goals. \u201cEffective transformations are always people-led and as the market leader in data visualisation, we knew Tableau would be perfect for encouraging our people to better connect with data in powerful yet intuitive ways,\u201d says Andy. \u201cFocussing on data literacy at the early stages helped everyone understand the benefits that a more self-service led approach to data analytics could bring. So many people are immersed in data every day, whether it be how we build cars, plan for the future, or interact with customers. Bringing it all together in Tableau means everyone can make better, more informed decisions, which is a huge benefit to the company.\u201d A great example is the way data is used on the workshop floor. \u201cManufacturing is a very process driven function, with loads of data captured at every stage. We wanted to move past simply viewing it and instead empower employees to engage with it properly,\u201d explains Andy. \u201cTableau\u2019s drillable dashboards were key here. Not only are they very visual, making it easy to see if KPIs are trending up or down, but having everything in one place means that should an issue arise, it\u2019s very easy to go deeper into the data and quickly identify the underlying factors. If a KPI is red, why is it red? Using Tableau, we can fix problems and celebrate successes much faster. No more flicking through dozens of PDFs!\u201d Truly exceptional customer experiences are one of Bentley\u2019s key hallmarks and the company knew that a more data driven approach had the potential to make it even more impressive than it already was.   \u201cTo deliver extraordinary customer journeys, we wanted to bring together everything we know about each individual customer in one place,\u201d says Andy. \u201cConnecting all our customer data sources in Salesforce and visualising them together in Tableau gives us a true understanding of every customer touch point, be it visits to the website, engagement on our mobile app, a visit to a retailer, or attendance at a Bentley event. We\u2019re no longer meeting them for the first time every time.\u201d \u201cNow, if a customer books onto a factory tour, we can look in Tableau and see if they are a prospect or a repeat customer, as well as exactly where they are in the order cycle. Using this information, tour guides can tailor factory experiences down to every minute detail,\u201d adds Andy.  \u201cThis is just one example of how we can use data to hyper personalise each customer\u2019s journey, turning them into brand advocates in the process.\u201d Combining data in this way also helps Bentley to spot emerging customer trends early and see regional variances, all of which can be used to tailor future sales and marketing activity more accurately. \u201cUsing Tableau, we can quickly see what colours and optional features are selling well, what\u2019s becoming more popular, or what\u2019s perhaps declining in popularity,\u201d says Andy. \u201cThis level of information helps retailers personalise offerings and focus/re-focus their efforts much faster than was previously possible.\u201d   At the beginning of Bentley\u2019s data journey, Andy knew buy-in at the senior level would be crucial to overall success. Fortunately, Bentley has a highly engaged board that already knew the value of good data, which made it easy to find champions at the highest levels. \u201cOur sales and marketing board member requested a Tableau dashboard very early on,\u201d explains Andy. \u201cHe also has Tableau Mobile on his iPad, giving him access to his dashboard and letting him drill down into the data whenever required, from any location. That kind of advocacy quickly builds momentum because other execs want those same benefits!\u201d At the other end, Andy and his team spent time identifying existing data champions throughout the company and helping them migrate over to Tableau. This dual pronged approach quickly started to build a powerful data culture at every level of the company. \u201cUsing Tableau\u2019s extensive functionality, we can automate manual data processes like reporting, saving employees hours, or even days of time each week,\u201d says Andy. \u201cWe also help people across the business create dashboards and teach them how to use the information uncovered to drive their decision making. The result is very organic growth, both from the top down and the bottom up.\u201d Bentley currently has around 100 Tableau creators and over 700 Tableau viewers, which accounts for more than 50 percent of its total office workforce. Looking to the future, Andy is also creating a \u2018future digital talent\u2019 team by upskilling existing staff as well as recruiting new talent to the business.  \u201cWithin just a few years, many of our data apprentices are presenting directly to the board and conversing with them about data on a regular basis,\u201d says Andy. \u201cTheir focus on data means they can talk just as easily to the tech and shop floor guys as they can with the executives, which is incredibly powerful for them as individuals, but also for the company as a whole.\u201d  "

        "content": "Establishing and nurturing a data culture can be challenging for any business. For Atlanta, Georgia-based children's apparel giant Carter's Inc., which ships around 700 million units per year and employs more than 20,000 people, the challenge was especially steep. Gaining insights to enable meaningful retail analytics across such a large organization means wrangling huge amounts of data so that insights are timely, usable, and fresh. \u201cThe data we manage is a pretty large volume, around 50 terabytes,\u201d said Matt Kott, Carter\u2019s Vice President of Global Data & Analytics. \u201cMuch of that is point of sale or digital purchases by our customers, containing a lot of detail around cart, product size and SKUs, payment types, loyalty, available inventory, and so on. We also engage with all of the functional areas\u201418 teams overall\u2014to help them build their processes in a more digital and automated way for daily operations and insights.\u201d In 2019, after running a legacy retail analytics platform for 10 years on Netzetta MicroStrategy, Carter\u2019s chose to migrate to Tableau Server running on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Along the way, the company also selected Commerce Cloud from Salesforce as its retail CRM. The powerful new grouping of technologies set the company up for growth and success by connecting vast data stores to state-of-the-art analytics and visualization. This rapid migration at Carter\u2019s set the course for new levels of data literacy and digital transformation everywhere in the business, from sales and marketing to customer service and fulfillment. Executives and other strategists within the company now have ready access to insights that help drive efficiency and increased revenues. But in the midst of all this change, how does such a large, fast-moving company help all of its people keep pace with the technological leaps, so they can leverage new methods and do their jobs even better while supporting the company\u2019s overall success? At Carter\u2019s, the answer to this question is the establishment of a Tableau Center of Enablement (CoE) focused on improving and expanding each department\u2019s data literacy and making all personnel comfortable with and excited about using data analytics technology. \u201cWe partner each quarter with different business units to work on self-service projects,\u201d said Selma Dogic, center's senior manager . \u201cThis ensures at least one developer within each department gets hands-on experience building out dashboards or data connectors, and sending those to the Tableau Server.\u201d The CoE makes Tableau available to users at various technical levels through training and engagement programs, as well as with department-focused quarterly projects and 1-on-1 sessions that pair users in different business groups with experts on Dogic's team. This adoption strategy paid off during the COVID-19 pandemic, empowering the company to keep pace with many changes, including new risks and challenges around supply chain and inventory management. It also gave disparate teams outside of IT new ways of understanding data more clearly, gaining valuable insights, and collaborating to make data-driven decisions. A central challenge with enablement, Dogic points out, is the varying levels of prior technical exposure among users. \u201cWe have some teams that come to us with robust technical requests, like data sourcing, while other people we meet have never seen a tool like Tableau,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when they do see it in action, even those less technical users understand right away that if they can figure out how to leverage the data, it can make a big difference in how they do their jobs.\u201d The move toward data literacy has impacted the various Carter\u2019s business groups in different, positive ways. For example, the Buying & Planning team previously spent 5 to 6 hours every weekend to manually build reports for executives to see first thing Monday morning. To achieve this, they extracted MicroStrategy data from the week\u2019s activities into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, added macros, and combined all of the resulting data into a usable report. Today, with Tableau, the team can generate reports automatically, giving the Buying Planning users back their weekends. \u201cWe simply cut out all of that middle manipulation and asked: What are you trying to get out of the report, and what exact data are you targeting to get it?\u201d said William Lawrence, Manager of Retail BI. \u201cOnce we understood what the Buying & Planning team needed, we built a procedure to generate the same information that was in the report. On Monday, the executive team simply looks at the dashboard, and gets the answers they need about the data.\u201d This particular story, Lawrence noted, had the added benefit of delighting executive users with the ability to drill down and ask further questions of the data presented in the dashboard, whether by filtering ad hoc to see details or prefiltering to create their own personalized views. \u201cWith this level of control, any of them can just see details about the business from their unique perspective, and all the other noise is gone,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re really pleased with that.\u201d The journey to transformation at Carter\u2019s has been comprehensive and breathtakingly fast, and its leaders within the company are confident technology will continue to make their business better by fostering rapid decision making through better insights. As Carter\u2019s continues to integrate breakthrough capabilities like AI and machine learning, those insights will be even more plentiful and powerful, enabling vital capabilities for agility and innovation. \u201cI\u2019m excited about where our data strategy can take us from a competitive perspective\u2014getting to that next level,\u201d said Kott. \u201cThrough a mixture of our cloud technology as well as Tableau and some of our advanced analytics or AI/ML ambitions, we can really take Carter\u2019s from a very traditional retail operating model and move toward something that's a lot more predictive and prescriptive.\u201d Through it all, the team kept a strict eye on governance, using Tableau Data Management to enforce granular permissions and to help build trust among the company's many data constituents. \"Before we started using Data Management, our whole data landscape was a black box to the business,\u201d said Dogic. \"Various departments were following different business logic to achieve the same KPIs.\" Data Management provided the trusted governance, cataloging structure, and data preparation capabilities to normalize each team's access on the back end, showing more clearly and consistently how the data and insights pertained to retail sales. Dogic summed it up: \"This 'flattening out' of the landscape gave us what we needed\u2014a single source of truth. Now, for the first time, we can align everyone's workflows and show a holistic view of the business using data that was always siloed in the past.\" Overall, said Dogic, Tableau is a powerful asset for helping Carter's address the current and future needs of the rapidly changing online consumer market, and expanding data culture at the company in a governed, self-service environment. The CoE gives personnel at every level the opportunity to keep pace with these changes while unifying and transforming Carter\u2019s into a new, dynamic, data-oriented company. \u201cTableau has definitely played a key role in democratizing data for all of our employees, enabling us to build dashboards that show the right data to the right people at the right times,\u201d said Dogic. \u201cWhen all employees can analyze the data themselves as part of their jobs, the whole company grows stronger together.\u201d"

        "company": "Japan Airlines",
        "content": "Established in 2011, the JAL Philosophy is the system of values that all employees working with JAL services and products are expected to hold. One part of this JAL Philosophy is to achieve the \u201cBest Baton Pass,\u201d which means the approach of having employees work together across the boundaries separating Group companies, departments, and job types to provide the best and safest air travel to customers. Although this has spread throughout the company as a \u201cbehavioral philosophy,\u201d it is most plainly apparent in activities that utilize Tableau throughout the entire Group and the organizational and personal connections upon which such activities are based. As covered in detail below, Tableau serves as a \u201cshared language\u201d within the JAL Group and its usage has strengthened collaboration between the organization and employees. Various improvements and transformations have been made in operational areas ranging from maintenance to aircraft operation, customer service, and safety and security thanks to data visualization and analysis enabled by Tableau. As the entire JAL Group comes together to fully prepare aircraft for flight, perform safe and comfortable aircraft operation, and provide and sell customized tour packages, the result is a more optimal delivery of the \u201cBest Baton Pass.\u201d Takashi Yamazaki, a member of the Technology Strategy Group in the IT Planning Dept. of the IT Planning HQ at Japan Airlines Co., Ltd., recounts the expansion of Tableau usage at the company as follows.: \u201cWe started with something called the Data College, which consisted of a small number of volunteers in the Group. This grew into the current organization, DANCU (Data Analytics and Culture Unit), which promotes data-driven management throughout the Group. We also have an internal Tableau user group called \u201ctablab\u201d with over 200 members who provide support to one another, which plays a major role in promoting Tableau use within the Group as a whole.   We originally used another BI product throughout the JAL Group. However, it had weak visualization features, so every organization and individual therein would have to download the data and analyze/share it via Excel. This apparently meant that multiple people were doing similar tasks at their respective workplaces, so in many cases the work was inefficient and dependent on individual skills. It was in this context that the time came to renew our internal data analysis infrastructure in the JAL Group. We considered modernizing our BI products as well, before deciding to implement Tableau throughout the company. Satoshi Ganeko is a member of the Quality Control Group in the Operational Safety Promotion Dept. of Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. He described the process that led to the adoption of Tableau as follows: \u201cI felt that Tableau\u2019s capabilities and latent potential were beyond question, and I had already started using it myself. In reality, there were several other such employees at various organizations in the Group. In other words, the groundwork was already laid for rapidly deploying Tableau in collaboration with other departments,\u201d said Ganeko. Other reasons he gave for Tableau having been adopted were its high ease of use, hands-on experience leaving the impression that Tableau was a tool that could be adequately learned by users in all organizations, the community and rich abundance of information available on Tableau use, the possibility of deployment using external networks, and the ease of linking Tableau up with various other systems. Faster Deployment of Airplane Breakdown Prediction Monitoring Tools and Removal of the Reliance on Specific Individuals\u2019 Skills \u201cAt companies throughout the JAL Group, operational improvements are being made that make good use of Tableau to contribute to the \u2018Best Baton Pass\u2019. One representative example is the accelerated deployment of airplane breakdown prediction monitoring tools and the removal of the reliance on specific individuals\u2019 skills at JAL Engineering Co., Ltd. Kuniharu Harada is a member of the Reliability Management Group at the Systems Technology Office in the Engineering Dept. of JAL Engineering Co., Ltd. Here, he describes the issues faced by the company prior to Tableau deployment. \u201cWe developed a model to predict airplane breakdowns using flight data and have deployed that for use in monitoring operations. Initially, we used Excel macros to implement the logic we developed, and there were only a few people who knew how to use VBA, so the work tended to be reliant on specific individuals. Design, testing, and revisions all took an extremely long time to do. Other problems were that we weren\u2019t able to do anything complex with Excel graphs, and they were lacking both in terms of aesthetics and interactivity,\u201d said Harada. Implementing Tableau solved all of those problems. We reduced the number of days needed to implement logic to one-tenth of the time, from roughly ten business days to just one. Moreover, although we have implemented roughly 100 Viz, you don\u2019t need to do any scripting to use Tableau, so anybody can easily maintain the Viz or change requirements. \u201cEase-of-use improved dramatically, and we drastically reduced the amount of time between users making decisions based on data and taking action based on that data. In addition, the range of analysis being done has increased now that users are able to do it themselves, and the fact that it is now easier than before to identify some risks is also helping to improve the quality of our equipment,\u201d said Harada. Building on these results, Makoto Higashijima of the IT Digital Promotion Dept. at JAL Engineering Co. emphasizes the following. \u201cIf all you want to do is create dashboards, anybody can do that, and they can also do it with other tools. However, Tableau enables individual people to analyze data from the specific perspective in which they\u2019re interested and display it as-is on their dashboard, so everyone is able to look at that and compare their current work flow with the ideal work flow to engage in deeper discussions and make improvements. I think the best part of Tableau is its potential to serve as a powerful tool for making operational innovations in this way,\u201d said Higashijima.    Breakdown Prediction   Preflight Sharing of Visualizations of Landing Routes Meanwhile, at the Flight Operations HQ of Japan Airlines Co., Ltd., Tableau is used for preflight sharing of visualizations of landing routes at airports. Airplane landing routes for each airport are changed as necessary based on weather conditions and direction from air traffic control. This requires pilots to calculate entry paths and elevations in advance based on several patterns and share this work with other pilots on the same flight. According to Harumi Ikeshita of the Training Review Planning Office at Japan Airlines Co., Ltd., integrating Tableau into this process improved the efficiency of preparatory work, made it easier to share information thanks to visualizations, and drastically improved the accuracy of mutual understanding between operators. \u201dIn the past, for some types of takeoff routes, individual pilots would prepare for flights by plotting routes by hand on a topographic map. This could result in some differences between individuals with respect to flight paths and elevations, and there was a risk that pilots would not notice mistakes. Moreover, since this was done by hand, it involved a lot of work. Even once finished, it was possible that an error might have been made, so it was not always easy to share one\u2019s work with other pilots,\u201d said Ikeshita. Using Tableau drastically reduced the workload involved in plotting maps and making calculations. As a result, it became possible to respond more quickly and appropriately than before in situations like the Sakurajima volcano eruption of July 2022, enabling personnel to quickly create and share landing routes to Kagoshima Airport that avoided the smoke from the eruption. \u201cBy enabling pilots to share data with each other, it is easier to check whether there are any errors in the route settings. It also establishes a shared visualization of routes between pilots of the flight ahead, enabling flights to be conducted more smoothly and precisely. Additionally, the use of, among other things, up-to-date satellite imagery to show actual structures on the route and checkpoints along the way has dramatically improved visualization and interactivity. These advancements have made it easier to get an idea of turning points, elevations, and other aspects of flights as well as to compare multiple routes to each other, all of which directly benefit flight safety.    Takeoff and Landing Routes   Better Customer Service for Counter Users Tableau has also proven to be a powerful tool for improving customer service. JAL Plaza is JAL\u2019s only face-to-face counter where customers can buy flight tickets and make inquiries. At JAL NAVIA Co., Ltd., which is responsible for operating the counter, work is underway to use Tableau to improve operations. At the center of those efforts is Aya Suzuki of the General Affairs Group in the Tokyo Center JAL Plaza Business Office. \u201cAlthough we had always collected data on visitors and customer service, aggregating and analyzing that data in Excel took time and didn\u2019t help improve the quality of customer service provided by individual staff members. After Tableau was introduced, it became possible to aggregate customer service data for all 40 staff in an instant, and we were able to conduct briefings to improve individuals\u2019 skills based on data on specific staff members\u2019 customer service work volume and hours. We\u2019ve also launched initiatives to optimize personnel allocation by identifying time periods with a lot of customer traffic and matters that take a lot of time to handle, and initiatives to provide customers with the right services by understanding trends in the purposes for which people come to the Plaza,\u201d said Suzuki. Quantitatively, as well, it can be seen from the data on time spent handling web-related inquiries that incorporating SMS and QR into the customer service process reduced average service times by around 10 minutes; from 31 minutes and 52 seconds to 22 minutes and 29 seconds.   Improving Aviation Safety and Security Data Monitoring At the Safety Planning Group in the Safety Promotion Dept. at Japan Airlines Co., Ltd., which is in charge of aviation safety and security for the entire JAL Group., Tableau is used to improve the monitoring of aviation security and security data. Daisuke Higaki, also in the group, said the following: \u201cPreviously, there was a system in place for the entire JAL Group that aggregated Excel data from each department. However, it did not have statistical analysis functionality. With Tableau, now anyone can easily handle large amounts of collected data. Dashboards that have been polished based on discussions with viewer users, and the documentation thereby created, are now used in many meetings by the management council and others,\u201d said Higaki. For example, if a question is asked during a meeting, Tableau makes it possible to simply look at the data and respond immediately rather than postponing the answer until more research can be done, making for smoother discussions. Higaki said that was the biggest benefit to using Tableau. He continued as follows: \u201cSafety is the most important thing to an airline company, and in order to discover and accurately deal with risks that threaten that safety, airline companies need to try out various methods of classifying events, etc., and run through a PDCA cycle. Tableau enables faster visualization and analysis that catalyze this PDCA cycle, and that has been an extremely big step forward for us,\u201d said Higaki. In just three years since it was first introduced in 2019, Tableau usage has expanded throughout the entire JAL Group. As Tableau implementation manager Yamazaki discussed in the opening, underlying this popularity is the active daily work by the members of \u201ctablab,\u201d an internal JAL user group, and \u201cDANCU,\u201d a data usage promotion organization. Satoshi Tamura is a member of the Technology Strategy Group in the IT Planning Dept. of the IT Planning HQ at Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. He is also one of the core members of the roughly 35-member DANCU organization. \u201cI have DATA Saber credentials, and I provide support for users who contact us because they want to do particular things in Tableau. I myself have been impressed by how easy it is to use Tableau, and I recommend it to others with the mindset that \u2018as long as you have some data, you should try plugging it into Tableau,\u201d said Tamura. Masako Ono is a member of the Marketing Group in the Client Sales Dept. at JALPAK Co., Ltd., which provides package tours for both domestic and international travel. She began using Tableau without knowing anything about it, but she has now grown to become a core member of DANCU. \u201cIf there\u2019s ever something I don\u2019t understand, I just ask in our Tableau group chat and instantly get an answer from a group member, so now I\u2019m very capable with Tableau. I\u2019ve been able to bring what I\u2019ve learned back to my workplace and put it to use. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of tours for travel changed on a moment-to-moment basis, so I am very grateful for Tableau because it enables us to visualize reservation data and use that to plan future policy,\u201d said Ono. Seiya Uchiumi is a member of the Data Strategy Office at JALCARD, Inc., which is a credit card company. He is also a core member of the same DANCU group, and he too puts the things he learned in the Tableau community to work to improve operations at his company, rapidly increasing the number of Tableau users at JALCARD. \u201cData analysis is extremely important to understanding our customers, and it was thanks to organizations like DANCU and Tablab that we were able to link up with other companies in the JAL Group to utilize data that we would never think to use otherwise. This is a wonderful community full of people with whom I would otherwise never come into contact in my work, all brought together by the \u2018shared language\u2019 of Tableau,\u201d said Uchiumi. Tableau usage throughout the JAL Group really manages to achieve the best baton pass among Group personnel. To conclude, Yamazaki discussed his outlook on the future as follows: \u201cRecently, there\u2019s been no end to the examples of Tableau being put to good use that make you think, \u2018Wow! I didn\u2019t expect it to be useful there too!\u2019 To that extent, Tableau use is really beginning to grow in unpredictable ways. Moving forward, we want to continue pushing forward to improve even further, working with companies both inside and outside the JAL Group to combine data in novel ways and thereby generate new business value,\u201d said Yamazaki."

        "content": "In the fast-paced world of fashion, the ability to rapidly spot and act on trends gives brands a competitive edge. That\u2019s why ZALORA has adopted the principle of \u201cdata first, then fashion\u201d. Part of the publicly-traded Global Fashion Group, ZALORA is a leading online fashion destination where millions of customers across Asia can shop thousands of local and international brands. ZALORA relies on Tableau to stay on top of the latest trends and to inform decisions about everything from marketing to merchandising and operations. The business also uses Tableau to power Trender, a data-solution service that provides brands with insights on consumer preferences and behavior. Released just in time to help brands navigate COVID-19, Trender is now a growing source of revenue for ZALORA. It is also helping more and more brands to be agile and resilient to change.  The value of Trender stems from ZALORA\u2019s massive repository of trade data, including transaction data across six different markets. Combined with Tableau's visual analytics, this data reveals essential trends in customer behavior, like which age groups and regions are shopping most and which product categories are most popular. Brands can use this information to shape their retail strategies for online and in-store. Specifically, marketers can obtain an in-depth understanding of consumer segments and purchasing behavior to streamline their efforts on targeting the right audience, while designers can gain insights into trending colors, materials, and styles to work into the next season's collection. They can also drill down into sales across different markets as they evaluate where to open stores next based on the density of potential shoppers. Trender was created in just six months, with ZALORA\u2019s in-house fashion experts, marketers, and data analysts leveraging Tableau's embedded analytics platform. ZALORA has since leveraged Tableau\u2019s APIs and developer tools to extend and enrich Trender\u2019s capabilities and turn it into a dedicated analytics portal.  Brands can log in to access near real-time data on web traffic and sales. They can also compare their performance with that of other brands that sell through ZALORA. The anonymized data helps brands see where they are leading or falling behind. It also helps them understand if increases or decreases in sales are specific to their brand or part of a general trend.  Other enhancements to Trender include an extension that allows for images to be added to dashboards. This is a popular feature that allows brands to quickly correlate the data they\u2019re looking at with the right product.  ZALORA is now set to scale and take Trender global. Revenue from the data platform Trender has grown 100% year-on-year between 2020 and 2021.  The next step is to make the service available to brands that sell through the Global Fashion Group\u2019s other businesses, including THE ICONIC, and Dafiti.  To support this growth, ZALORA has automated its onboarding process so it can add new users to Trender and provide them with the right security permissions in just a few clicks. In the past, this process took up to two hours.   In the future, ZALORA will add new analytics services to Trender. These include services leveraging AI and Machine Learning as well as natural language processing (NLP). ZALORA is also exploring how it can use Trender to help brands measure and drive their sustainability efforts."

        "company": "Nanyang Girl's High School",
        "content": "Founded in 1917, Nanyang Girls\u2019 High School (NYGH) is one of Singapore\u2019s oldest and most respected schools. NYGH prides itself in providing a holistic education that empowers students to thrive in the globalised world of the 21st century. Data literacy is now an essential part of that education and is being taught to students in year seven (Secondary One) with the help of Tableau.  \u201cWe\u2019re living in an age where data literacy is essential in our daily lives, in the way we think and in the way we consume information,\u201d said Mr. Han Pin Goh, Head, Infocomm & Educational Technology at NYGH. \"Teaching data literacy is therefore a gift all schools can provide students so they can become discerning consumers and creators of knowledge.\" As NYGH\u2019s students start to experience the benefits of data literacy, the school shares insights into its program and advice on how other institutions can prepare their students for a data-driven future.  Many higher education institutions have realized the importance of equipping future graduates with data skills. What NYGH has demonstrated is that students are capable of learning and applying these skills much earlier.  Discussing the school\u2019s decision to make data viz a part of the year seven curriculum, Mr. Goh said it would be a waste for students to not make use of the data available to them today.  \u201cIf they don\u2019t learn now, when? We believe it\u2019s never too early to see, think, and interact with data,\u201d said Mr. Goh. \u201cChildren are already accustomed to seeing data each day, from their YouTube viewer stats to their Spotify stream numbers.\u201d   In the past, NYGH students learned about data through more traditional statistics lessons. They analyzed smaller datasets with the help of a calculator and plotted  graphs with pen-and-paper. These classical skill sets are inadequate for the 21st century, leading the school to develop its own Data Viz curriculum leveraging Tableau.  \u201cStudents seldom have the opportunity to search for their own data, interact with that data, and derive their own conclusions and meaning,\u201d said Mr. Goh. \u201cTableau\u2019s interactivity and ease of use is a game changer and empowers students to be their own knowledge builders.\u201d With Tableau, students do not have to be experts in working with spreadsheets or write their own code to analyze or visualize their own data. Instead, they can create interactive dashboards using intuitive features like drag-and-drop and in just a few mouse clicks.   As part of NYGH\u2019s Data Viz curriculum, year seven students spend an hour each week over three-months learning how to create and tell stories with dashboards. First, students are taught basic design principles so that they can visualize patterns and trends in an engaging way. Then, they are taught how to apply these principles in Tableau. Finally, the students are given time and space to build dashboards on their own.  One thing that\u2019s made NYGH\u2019s curriculum so effective is that students are encouraged to work with real datasets that relate to issues they\u2019re passionate about. In one example, students used Tableau to explore a public dataset on public housing resale prices in Singapore. They were able to uncover time-series trends and geographical disparities, helping them to have more informed discussions about housing and social issues.  Other topics explored by students include social and global issues such as gender disparities in higher education courses and international trends in global warming.  \u201cBy empowering students with an easy to use tool like Tableau, they can explore data at their own pace and uncover insights by themselves. They can also dig into the patterns and root causes of social issues, and not just rely on what they hear or read elsewhere,\u201d said Mr. Goh.    NYGH\u2019s Data Viz curriculum supports its pioneering efforts to develop a generation of changemakers empowered by data. It equips students to gain deeper insights into topics of interest using data available on the internet or data they collect themselves. It also allows them to gain a more nuanced and authentic understanding about textbook claims or current affairs. In future years, students may choose to take up more advanced elective modules on Data Viz and apply them onto their research projects. They may also initiate service-learning projects where they apply their data skills to teach or serve others in the community.  Asked what advice he had for other K-12 teachers and administrators, Mr. Goh stressed the urgency and simplicity of teaching data skills.  \u201cStart today by collaborating with a group of passionate teachers and be curious. Find datasets you are interested in and start exploring them in Tableau. Finally, allow students to surprise you with the amazing data stories they can narrate themselves,\u201d said Mr. Goh. "

        "content": "American Family Insurance (AmFam) is a private mutual insurance company providing a variety of consumer and commercial products, including property, casualty, life, health, and homeowners coverage, along with investment and retirement planning products and services. Corporate teams at AmFam use Salesforce CRM products including Salesforce Marketing Cloud to generate, manage, and analyze data for a wide range of activities, from account management and customer service to business development and executive planning. Beyond corporate implementations of CRM, however, AmFam has another important set of users to support with data: the local and regional agencies that sell AmFam products, organized as independent contractors who are licensed to transact with end customers and incentivized to meet performance targets. To be successful in their own businesses, and to support AmFam\u2019s success in the process, these agencies are an integral part of the AmFam data ecosystem, gaining insights from corporate data that help optimize their sales and customer service contributions. Susan Malack is Manager of Sales Insights & Analytics at AmFam. \u201cThe work that my team does is really for the agency owner, so they can have all the information and metrics they need to run their business successfully,\u201d said Malack. \u201cIt\u2019s our goal to make sure they have that quickly and at their fingertips, because it helps them get the answers they need for how their businesses are performing, so then they can spend less time wondering and more time serving customers.\u201d Malack\u2019s team used Tableau Embedded Analytics to create a new self-service analytics web portal for agencies and corporate users alike. The result was myDashboard, a collection of data visualizations showing customized, personalized analytics designed to give users helpful information and insights in real time. AmFam sought opportunities for improving the delivery of analytics to its agents needed around product availability, performance metrics, and expected business results. Ultimately this led to myDashboard, a portal platform that could integrate into whatever workflows and UI the agencies were already accustomed to using. MyDashboard empowers users with access to vital insights without disrupting their work by having to look in multiple other locations. The myDashboard solution offers AmFam agencies new ways of doing things: Malack\u2019s team has automated processes with the new portal, and they\u2019ve allowed for consolidation and retirement of older systems, enabling agency and corporate employees the time to pursue other initiatives. To illuminate this new functionality, Malack offers a real-world sales planning example. \u201cAn agency owner might not realize they\u2019re only one or two policies away from meeting a bonus incentive or campaign award,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the data right there in front of them, they can see that insight and take action. They can even be creative and use it to generate some fun competition among their agency staff, if they have one. Without the embedded data, these kinds of opportunities wouldn\u2019t typically come about.\u201d Another example, she said, comes when agency owners use embedded analytics to identify cross-selling opportunities. \u201cWhen a customer has two kinds of policies with us, the agency owner can talk to them about also signing up for a third policy, or other value-added offering,\u201d Malack said. Also, with modernization comes the opportunity for professional development from interacting with data dashboards and visualizations, often for the first time. \u201cFor people who are just learning about data, this can be very new territory,\u201d said Derek Alsup, Business Analytics Analyst IV at AmFam. \u201cThat can further enhance the owner's mindset. I won't even say it's the future anymore\u2014this is the reality that we live in now.\u201d That learning curve will continue to apply in future scenarios, Alsup emphasized, as AI and other developments can broaden users\u2019 workflow even further. \u201cRight now, we give them the information to help them make timely and relevant decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the future, we really want the data to help guide that decision making, to say: This is what we think you should do based on these conditions and what we're seeing right now with your customers.\u201d As companies modernize and big data gets harnessed in new ways, analytics dashboards and visualizations are becoming ubiquitous, appearing everywhere from business software and consumer apps to news websites and gaming portals. With myDashboard, AmFam has joined this approach to help its agency owners and employees across geographies and departments get the insights they need. Personalized views of embedded Tableau dashboards, infused into familiar user experiences, enable dynamic, near-real-time reporting on key metrics and performance. And these resources all draw from a single source of truth to provide data-driven insights that continue to transform the AmFam corporate\u2013agency business model.

        "title": "F5 builds data-focused culture with Tableau Blueprint and Tableau Cloud",
        "company": "F5",
        "content": "Founded in 1996, Seattle-based F5 made its name by offering best-in-class application delivery hardware and related physical and virtual networking appliances. Over the years, the company has evolved to provide multi-cloud application services that optimize and secure every app and API anywhere, including on-premises, in the cloud, or at the edge. Currently, F5 employs 7,000 people globally, helping customers create, secure, and operate adaptive applications that reduce costs, improve operations, and better protect users. For the past five years, F5 has been on a journey of digital transformation, with strategies for moving its products to the cloud and transitioning to more SaaS-based services. In becoming a leader in multi-cloud application services and security technologies, F5 realized the importance of leveraging data in new ways that empower its workforce on every level to help the company achieve success. F5 first implemented Tableau Server in 2012, and in October 2020 they performed a 9-month-long migration to Tableau Cloud to enable more features while achieving better IT efficiencies. In those early days of transforming to become a data-driven culture, most Tableau users at F5 were in the sales and marketing organizations, running enhanced reporting through dashboards created in Tableau. As Tableau adoption grew and took hold, data increasingly became a force for advancing the company\u2019s mission and strengthening its operations. Amie Bright, F5 RVP of Enterprise Data Strategy and Insights, was a key player in kickstarting this movement at F5 and keeping it going in the right direction. Along the way, she and others pulled in resources that would help align the company with its business and technology goals of bringing data to everyone at the company in ways that would enrich their work, empower better decision-making, spark ingenuity, and improve outcomes across the enterprise. Over the years, this data culture would grow to include almost every line of business at the company, including product teams, global services, customer success, finance, HR, manufacturing, and IT. But at the start, it took the collaboration of these early users to move on from older, more analog methods and get others to start seeing data in a new light. \u201cThere was a groundswell of individuals at F5 that knew there was a better way,\u201d said Bright. \u201cWe started with the people who really cared about the data, and used their experiences and passion to help get the word out to the rest of the company.\u201d To chart a path forward into a new data culture, F5 needed a clear perspective on the existing disconnect many of its non-technical workers experienced in trying to engage with data as part of their day-to-day roles. As in many other organizations facing similar challenges, they discovered the issue often came down to users\u2019 comfort level with the data itself. \u201cAs F5 was proceeding with its data modernization strategy and really figuring out what we wanted to do, one of the things we kept hearing was that people didn\u2019t trust the data,\u201d said Bright. \u201cEither they didn\u2019t get the right data when they needed it, or else they weren\u2019t sure the best way to use the data once they had it.\u201d Through the Tableau Blueprint assessment framework, Bright and her team learned a great deal about this lack of clarity, and about the various users\u2019 and user groups\u2019 specific concerns. Using this input and further guidance from the Blueprint methodology, they developed a data success program focused on helping each of these data constituencies derive the insights they needed and take new, better-informed actions. \u201cThe program we\u2019ve adopted includes a central data success team to help steer the ongoing data initiatives, and an analytics center of excellence that is 400 members strong and growing,\u201d said Bright. \u201cAnd honestly, it started with this assessment through the Tableau Blueprint process to really figure out where we needed to focus.\u201d Nelson Jean was an initial champion and program leader for Tableau at F5, and is now the program manager of the data success program F5 built under Blueprint. He credits F5\u2019s use of Tableau Cloud as fundamental to the company\u2019s overall technology objectives. \u201cWe were really starting to embrace a cloud-first strategy around that time,\u201d Jean said. \u201cOur move to cloud-based Tableau saves us a lot of IT time and hassles, plus it gives our people helpful new capabilities, like scheduling data flows with Prep Conductor, or helping build out our enterprise data catalog with Tableau Catalog.\u201d Bright agrees, and credits Blueprint with opening the team\u2019s eyes to that landscape of opportunities they could explore. \u201cTableau Blueprint was critical for pointing us in the right direction with our data culture transformation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe found out there were things we were doing well, and other areas that required changes. Blueprint helped us figure out where we could make improvements to keep us on track and ensure our program was a success.\u201d The best-intended transformations at a company can languish indefinitely if they lack support from the top offices. For Bright, that meant enlisting buy-in from key executives at F5. Securing their input gave Bright the green light to capitalize on existing excitement. \u201cExecutive support was essential for getting things rolling,\u201d said Bright. \u201cThis helped accelerate the momentum we\u2019d already started within that existing groundswell of support. Exec buy-in and data advocates\u2014to be successful, we really needed both.\u201d Marketing and customer service are two key areas of F5\u2019s business that have realized the benefits of this transformation. The marketing team uses data in Tableau Cloud to determine to what extent their campaign spending is driving leads. Based on data they see at any moment, marketers can reallocate funds where they\u2019ll be most effective, as well as refine the ways marketing engages with sales operations. On the customer success side, visualizing data about usage patterns and purchase histories improves visibility into each account and helps ensure customers are getting what they need. Future uses of Tableau will expand on this use of data to become more predictive about customer purchase behaviors. One of the greatest value factors F5 got from migrating to Tableau Cloud, according to Bright, was that now people anywhere at the company can easily build their own dashboards and explore data on their own. This capability serves to democratize data across technical and non-technical users alike at the company, empowering them to make faster and more confident decisions while overcoming bottlenecks with always making formal requests of the data analysis team. With built-in best practices and an easy drag-and-drop UI, each user regardless of their role becomes the author of their own visual story using the data they discover. \u201cHaving Tableau Cloud means everyone gets a Creator or Explorer license, even if they're not a data analyst,\u201d said Bright. \u201cThey just click to create a dashboard, and then they can save it and share it, all in the cloud. They don\u2019t have to download anything onto their desktop, and they don\u2019t have to upload anything to Tableau.\u201d She\u2019s also a big fan of the automatic updates and feature upgrades that the cloud-based licensing model provides. \u201cWhen I went to TC22 and in the keynote they covered all these exciting new features, I thought: Oh, thank goodness we\u2019re on Tableau Cloud,\u201d Bright said. \u201cBecause that means we get all of these latest and greatest capabilities automatically, as soon as they come out, without having to install them or run updates or really do anything at all.\u201d Ascending as a new kind of industry leader in the cloud, F5 carefully considered each step that a customer follows to learn about, try, purchase, and get support for F5 technology. Each step in this journey is integrated with data services and applications designed to empower F5 with the best possible analysis for making customer relationships mutually productive and beneficial. F5 uses:  Using Tableau Cloud, F5 greatly reduced the IT burden of maintaining the data visualization piece of this configuration. \u201cOur IT team saves around 15 hours per week now,\u201d said Jean. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to deal with server errors or failures, so there\u2019s less time spent monitoring and worrying about resource capacity.\u201d Fewer issues also means fewer support tickets, Jean points out. \u201cSupport tickets take time to write, and then there\u2019s all the back-and-forth with the support team, recreating the issues so they can be captured into logs,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those activities went away when we migrated, so that adds up to a lot of time savings as well.\u201d All in all, these changes added up to increased productivity company-wide, and helped shift the focus away from grappling with data and toward seamlessly integrating it into daily activities. Today, the culture change is plainly visible to every user who interacts with Tableau. \u201cI recently sat with someone at F5 who was struggling to pull together the data they needed for a big customer event, and an hour later, they had everything they needed and knew exactly what to do with it. It was almost like magic,\u201d said Bright. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like here now\u2014everyone gets to create their own magic. And just looking back now at our journey and what F5 has built, I think that\u2019s really amazing.\u201d"

        "company": "Papaya Global",
        "content": "Papaya Global is serious about business intelligence (BI). This Israel-based unicorn startup focuses on global payroll solutions and was recently valued at $3.7 billion. Papaya launched Tableau in 2020 to drive a better user experience to their hundreds of customers, including Toyota and Microsoft. The organisation has since multiplied their active users 10-fold and developed embedded dashboards on everything from payroll and HR analytics, to gender and pay equity. The PapayaBI product became a significant competitive advantage of the Papaya Global Platform offering with unmatched value in the market. Multiple initiatives are now being deployed to further expand and enrich the PapayaBI product. Papaya Global enables organisations to connect their workforce and payroll management onto a single global platform. Available worldwide, Papaya has $3 billion in payroll under management and more than 700 customers. Payroll devours data. Every process \u2013 including people management, compliance, meeting in-country legal jurisdictions \u2013 creates vast volumes of data. Papaya reimagines these processes, introducing AI, automation, and other modern technologies to ensure high security standards, accurate compliance and fast, streamlined payroll processing. Reporting is an equally vital asset in the payroll process. Organisations need to consolidate payroll analytical data in support of agile, trusted decision-making among finance, HR, and billing teams \u2013 all with custom permissions and controls. However, reporting is rarely straightforward: In most organisations, global payroll data is locked away in fragmented, siloed sources, making it more difficult to deliver timely, accurate payroll reporting. Itzik Polad, Head of BI, Papaya explains, \u201cOur customers want instant insights to important questions, like, \u2018What are our total labor costs?\u2019, \u2018How do those costs distribute across locations and cost centres?\u2019, how much of this amount is basic versus variable costs?\u2019 , and \u2018Did our payroll spend rise this month \u2013 and if so why?\u2019.\u201d  Polad and his team launched Tableau more than two years ago to transform the way customers see and understand their people, payroll, and payments data. \u201cBack then, we were a small start-up. It made sense to buy versus build, owing to our limited resources and tight launch timeframe. Tableau was the runaway choice: the flexibility, security standards, user experience, and ongoing upgrades and enhancements as part of its product roadmap are unrivalled,\u201d says Polad. With the support of their partner Naya Technologies, Papaya implemented Tableau Embedded Analytics to create a seamless experience across its product portfolio. Customised, interactive, analytical capabilities increase product engagement and improve customer satisfaction by integrating rich content, data, and analytics directly into Papaya. Polad comments, \u201cNaya Technologies helped us accelerate the roll out and time to value.\u201d Success followed shortly after. \u201cOver the last three years, we experienced ten-fold user growth,\u201d says Polad. \u201cA lot of that is down to the user experience. A role-based landing page focuses on the top five user types, such as HR, finance, or payroll manager. The person is recognised when they log in and a dashboard presents all the key personalised insights in the first screen they see.\u201d For example, a finance manager can view the total employment cost, compare it over time, analyze it by country and by cost centre, understand the cost breakdown of the basic pay versus variables, and then the growth over the last year \u2013 all at a glance, when the person logs in. Plus they have the flexibility to download customised reports and view the data in CSV or other file types. \u201cWe want to answer customers\u2019 main five or six questions in the first dashboard,\u201d says Polad. These personalised Tableau dashboards are helping to monetise the solution to a global executive customer base \u2013 and drive the next phase of hyper growth. \u201cConsolidated, standardised data means that customers no longer need to switch applications and screens to reach people, payroll, and payments data. By introducing a unified, customised view of the data, they can make faster, data-driven decisions,\u201d he says."

        "company": "MutuiOnline",
        "content": "The Internet company\u2019s history is inextricably linked to one of the most interesting periods of the digitalization path affecting the Italian system: that of the web economy. Gruppo MutuiOnline (MOL) was founded as a startup in 2000 by its two founding partners, Marco Pescarmona and Alessandro Fracassi, and with its first comparison portal, MutuiOnline.it, it immediately established itself in the world of financial services. Year after year, the company expanded activities in other areas of product comparison and brokerage for individuals and in the area of outsourcing solutions for companies. The Group is, in fact, one of the first successful Italian FinTech companies and in 2007 was listed on the Italian Stock Exchange in the STAR segment; today it has more than 2,000 employees and more than 30 companies spread across 14 locations in Italy and abroad and operates with two distinct divisions: Broking and BPO (Business Process Outsourcing). The first is Italy's leading online comparison, promotion and brokerage of financial, insurance and e-commerce services and products through its varied retail brands, including MutuiOnline.it, PrestitiOnline.it, Segugio.it, SOSTariffe.it and TrovaPrezzi.it. The second deals with the outsourcing of high value-added processes on behalf of banks, financial intermediaries, insurance companies, investment companies, and rental/leasing companies. Refining and evolving technological skills is key to the continued growth of the MutuiOnline Group, and the transformation of analytics tools fits right into this evolutionary journey, which is far from over. The project to rethink the analytics infrastructure underpinning the Broking Division's activities began more than two years ago with the pandemic, which accelerated a transformation process that was already underway. As Andrea Proserpio recalls, \"There was a need for the rationalization and harmonization of data management methods. So a project was undertaken to find a more agile solution to manage access to data and thus expand the pool of users who could make data-driven decisions.\" On the specific instructions of top management, the reorganization of reporting activities was initiated. The initiative, launched in Q2 2020, has over time involved all major lines of business and has focused on simplifying logic in order to have reusable data models and create a strong user community, which now numbers about 70 people. Given this background, we needed a tool that was flexible and easy for end users to use. Software selection was conducted with three well-defined criteria: tool functionality, ease of use for business users, and cost. Tableau was selected, and after the successful completion of the first concept proofs, we moved on to the implementation of the first vertical module (dedicated to insurance products), which took only three months. \"The priority, Proserpio adds in this regard, was to create specific business data asset lines that were easily usable, with precise data line governance and without completely disrupting the previous approach. The goal was to keep users on board without scaring them, so we started training immediately. It was crucial to create the first reports together; in this way we saw confidence in the data and the tool grow rapidly.\" The Tableau platform has responded fully to this task, confirming the peculiarities of a very intuitive solution for which it was chosen and ensuring that the Broking Division can put in place an organic system of data analysis and processing, which is the subject of continuous improvement. Today it is used by virtually all business users in the Division and is meeting the need for standardized dashboards to allow users to access inherent data information and certified KPIs in a quick and organized manner, ensuring complete technical sustainability of the analysis activity. The benefits of implementing Tableau, as those involved assure, are most evident in the usability of the data for end users and the increased maintainability of the data models. As evidence of this, the \u201cmain\u201d sources for each line of business host half of the organization's reports. Nicoletta Papucci: Our role has been twofold: on the one hand, we have built and manage a machine that allows everyone to easily access the data assets, and on the other hand, we have been very focused on training users so that the company becomes increasingly data driven.\" From this point of view, an illustrative figure of the results achieved relates to the percentage of reports generated directly by end users, which account for two-thirds of the total. At the moment, as Papucci goes on to explain, \"It is difficult to quantify precisely the return on the investment made, but it is certain that using Tableau has enabled us to take a step forward both in our relationship with our business partners and in the speed with which we can analyze business trends; the level of data quality we are gradually achieving could also lead us in the future to measure the effectiveness of the solution in a more tangible way.\" This is the first step in the transformation of data management for the MutuiOnline Group, which now is looking to strengthen the back end. \"Thanks to the Tableau platform, Proserpio concludes in this regard, and the surprising autonomy of the users, we have consolidated the reporting structure. Now we can lean on the data modeling front and further improve data governance while maintaining control of what is produced at the reporting level. This, at the moment, is the most important challenge.\" In parallel, much attention will be given to consolidating what has been done so far and extending analytics best practices to smaller lines of business and serving the development of machine learning algorithms, which are strategic for supporting growth."

        "title": "How Freecharge Enhances Productivity and Innovation with Tableau",
        "company": "Freecharge",
        "content": "Freecharge is one of India\u2019s most popular platforms for online recharge, bill payment, investment, and other financial services. The digital payments company is a subsidiary of Axis Bank which is the third largest private sector bank in India.  In December 2019, Freecharge and Axis Bank created the Digital Business And Transformation team (DBAT) to lead innovation initiatives for both organizations and transform Freecharge into a digital bank. The team has achieved a number of major milestones including the launch of LEAP, a fully digital savings account and Axis Bank\u2019s first application to be hosted completely on the cloud.  The DBAT team has also set up a data lab to derive value from the massive amount of data created by LEAP and other new digital products. Tableau makes it easy for product owners and other business users to extract actionable insights from the data, ultimately helping them improve product performance and customer satisfaction.    DBAT\u2019s data lab has brought together its data science and data engineering teams so they can better collaborate on data initiatives. Their first priority was to set up a data platform that would speed up data analytics and help them quickly push insights out to the business. \u201cWe previously pushed our data from the cloud into on-premise systems to analyze and share it with the business and there were always challenges with the data flow. So we thought why not find a solution that would allow us to do everything on the cloud and that\u2019s where our story with Tableau started,\u201d said Sanjay Jain, Chief Technology & Product Officer - DBAT, Freecharge. Tableau has now become a single source of truth for all stakeholders, replacing spreadsheets with near real-time data they can access directly to inform decisions. Tableau connects directly with Amazon DocumentDB to ingest the data needed to create and refresh dashboards. The key dashboards established to date provide insights into the performance and adoption of Freecharge and Axis Bank products. Access to dashboards is governed using role-based access control, ensuring that data is protected and only available to those who need it.  DBAT\u2019s data lab has leveraged Tableau to provide the business with more granular information on the performance of digital products. For example, new dashboards track the account opening journey for the LEAP digital savings account and help the business understand customer demographics such as geographic location. The business can also identify when potential customers drop out of the onboarding journey which helps to highlight any barriers to conversion.  To combat fraud, the data lab has also developed a machine learning (ML) that detects when new users may be fake and require additional identification checks. Tableau will be used to test the model before it goes live and will be used on an ongoing basis to visualize the outputs from the model.   Additional dashboards help Freecharge and Axis Bank track the performance of bill pay and credit card solutions and ensure the successful completion of transactions. For example, they can track KPIs such as total payments received and the number of successful or failed payments.  Leveraging its data in this way has resulted in significant benefits, including a 30% increase in credit card customers as a result of a reduction in customer journey abandonment rates. The business has also experienced indirect efficiency gains of up to 80% related to credit cards. These efficiency gains have resulted from time saved on activities such as issues monitoring and resolution.  Additional benefits include an up to 90% reduction in effort spent on managing data manually and an up to 20% improvement in the business\u2019 ability to optimize marketing campaigns based on business intelligence. It has also saved up to 40 hours a month by automating the daily funnel charts used to track the performance of LEAP. This is in addition to time saved on other processes and dashboards and has helped to reduce business dependency on traditional data teams.   DBAT's ability to monitor the performance and adoption of products in near real-time supports the team\u2019s  agile way of working which is also underpinned by Slack. The secure channel-based messaging platform streamlines communication for Freecharge and aligns developers, design, product, project, data science and QA teams. Supported by a single collaboration hub, teams can ship quality code faster, improve service reliability, and stay engaged in an increasingly remote workplace.  Slack is also how the data lab communicates and collaborates with the technology team to build new dashboards.  In the future, the data lab plans to rollout Einstein Discovery to help business users extract predictions and recommendations from data. It also plans to make data searchable by keywords.  There are also plans to deploy Tableau more broadly and provide executives and teams like sales and HR with data to make smarter decisions. \u201cWe\u2019re democratizing data and providing the business with a level of visibility it\u2019s never had before. It will be a game changer for teams like our sales force and help us to continually enhance the customer experience,\u201d said Jain. "

        "content": "The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian organization, operating in more than 120 countries and territories to deliver food assistance in emergencies and build the resilience of food insecure people and communities. The organization helps save and change the lives of more than 100 million people each year, including places affected by conflict\u2014the single biggest driver of hunger worldwide. WFP has long been aware of the impact reliable data can have on its mission. By 2011, WFP was using data to accelerate its operations, reducing lead times by up to 40 days in countries such as Syria. By partnering with Tableau, WFP gained access to Tableau products and expertise, helping their staff make leaps forward in integrating visual analytics into vulnerability assessments and other work areas to improve impact at every level of the organization. Moreover, WFP not only learned best practices for using Tableau but also affirmed the importance of data culture and literacy in their organization\u2019s mission. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point now where data is a critical part of our day-to-day work,\u201d said Jay Mahanand, WFP Chief Information Officer and Director of Technology. \u201cIn an emergency, every second can mean the difference between life and death for the people we serve. Reliable data helps us reach as many people as we can, as fast and effectively as possible.\u201d Achieving results has meant focusing on uniting the people involved in WFP operations\u2014leadership, staff, and partners alike\u2014around a single community of shared data. Starting in 2016, using resources from Tableau Foundation and Tableau Blueprint, WFP began shaping the efforts of its workforce around better, more comprehensive, and more targeted uses of data, in the form of visualizations and other tools powered by Tableau Server. This initiative has been far-reaching within the organization and has benefited greatly from the visibility and support of WFP leadership, from top-level executives down to teams and individual staff. Shifting to a data-driven mentality has produced many positive benefits for WFP\u2019s bottom line. By 2020, for example, the organization had saved more than $138 million, which it redirected to support more people globally\u2014all by having the right analytics and the right people using them to create targeted, impactful solutions. \u201cWhen a single dollar can bridge the gap between hunger and health for the vulnerable, we can\u2019t afford to waste any resource,\u201d said Mahanand. \u201cOur efforts to date around data have helped us save enough money to feed an extra 2 million people for an entire year.\u201d Throughout WFP, teams have taken this challenge with the utmost seriousness. \u201cData literacy is the cornerstone of our ability to transform and become a data-driven culture,\u201d said Diana Klein, Head of the Data & Analytics branch of WFP\u2019s Technology Division. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re establishing our formal data literacy program, with support from Tableau.\u201d The program, said Klein, comprises three main areas of development: The blending of these elements yields a new level of efficiency and collaboration for WFP operations. \u201cLocation data, for example, helps us understand where to source food, where to drop it off, and where to store it in the meantime,\u201d said Klein. \u201cIf we all use the same source for location data, it means we\u2019re more accurate and productive when it comes to the food we gather and deliver. This kind of productivity is critical to fulfilling our mission.\u201d This new data literacy focus has already made its way into the day-to-day decision-making of WFP\u2019s operations. Teams across the organization use Tableau dashboards to execute on projects of all sizes, including the development and maintenance of complex plans for strategic interventions where help is needed. \u201cFor a specific intervention, we start by analyzing the number of food-insecure people affected, including where they are and what kinds of support they need,\u201d said Gaetan Bailby, Field Data Program Lead for WFP. \u201cWe focus on the variables that apply, such as the security situation, funding forecasts, and types of distribution support available. After we determine the best intervention methods and goals, we work with various international and national NGOs on how, when, and where we will support those in need depending on the context. Then we implement an operational plan, monitor how it\u2019s working, and assess whether we\u2019re achieving what we set out to do.\u201d Each WFP staff member and partner involved with an intervention relies on accurate, up-to-date analytics to perform their role effectively. As an example, Bailby cited 3.5 million people who needed help in the border countries of Ukraine. \u201cTo tackle this, we needed to analyze the refugee reception point locations and their relative location to nearby resource stockpiles,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we overlaid that data with the answers we found to key questions: How many more refugees are there likely to be next month? Where will we procure more food in order to support that additional influx?\u201d This information, Bailby said, helped WFP procurement specialists understand and predict the best places for finding assistance, while helping supply chain specialists know where to deliver it, and enabling program leadership to monitor the project\u2019s overall success. Having a structure for planning the changes was essential for evolving WFP\u2019s data capacity, and Tableau Blueprint played a critical role in that journey. The WFP methodology focused on building a roadmap of activities to increase staff capabilities and build out a thriving WFP data community. \u201cWith Blueprint, we were able to not only build a community, but also build capabilities and mature our ability to use the technology Tableau provided,\u201d said Klein. The result of all this change has been far-reaching, as evidenced in the daily lives of staff across the organization and the impact on food-insecure people worldwide. Data transformation at WFP has meant more than just upgrading people\u2019s toolsets\u2014it\u2019s been an opportunity for learning, growing, and pursuing new opportunities, with data leading the way. \u201cWhenever I see a data visualization, I am reminded of just how powerful data can be,\u201d said Bailby. \u201cVisualizations help me discover more about the challenges our teams face, and how to overcome them. To me, this shows that data can transcend projects, bureaucracy, and cultural boundaries\u2014it\u2019s really a means of bringing us all together.\u201d But above all, WFP\u2019s data culture has accelerated its mission to save and change lives at a time when conflict and the climate crisis continue to drive food insecurity to unprecedented worldwide levels. In just two years, the number of severely food-insecure people increased by more than 200 million\u2014from 135 million in 53 countries pre-pandemic to 345 million in 82 countries in 2022. \u201cEvery dollar we save can mean an added four meals for a child,\u201d said Mahanand. \u201cWith data-driven decision-making, we\u2019ve been able to stretch our resources farther than ever, putting more food into the hands of more people and helping them build better and brighter livelihoods that are more resilient to disruption.\u201d"

        "title": "Ministry of Health Transforms Health Services with Data-driven App Used by 102 million Indonesians",
        "company": "MOH Indonesia",
        "content": "The Ministry of Health (Indonesia) is responsible for protecting and improving public health nationally through implementing policies, setting standards, and fostering community empowerment to equitably provide quality health care services. Across Indonesia, and in health systems globally, the rapid rise of e-health, connected devices, and digital applications has created a major challenge for efficiently and securely managing data and integrating systems. While digital transformation was already well underway throughout Indonesia\u2019s health sector, the global COVID-19 crisis highlighted the urgency to dramatically increase the capacity, resilience, and flexibility of the health system using data and technology. During the crisis, there was a shortage of medication and supply as well as the lack of hospital resources (e.g., beds, doctors) which had a severe impact on public health and had threatened to overwhelm the health systems. In response, Indonesia, through the Ministry of Health, established a dedicated Digital Transformation Office (DTO) with a mission to transform healthcare delivery in Indonesia, appointing Setiaji as Chief.  The DTO was formed to help drive the pandemic response in the short term, as well as accelerate the ongoing digital transformation program with a focus on using data to support policy analysis in the Ministry of Health. With data at the heart of the long-term solution, Tableau has become an important technology partner, as Setiaji explains: \u201cThe ministry is committed to developing policies using data based evidence. With so many applications already running, there is an enormous quantity of data and raw information available.\u201d Tableau helped the Ministry of Health manage data related to COVID-19 in near real-time including confirmed case records, vaccination, and citizen mobility. This data was beneficial for policy making during the crisis and made available to  the public through interactive data visualization. To create significant and sustainable innovation, the Ministry of Health understands the need to collaborate with all industry stakeholders to build a platform that connects data and systems centrally across the national health ecosystem. With ~60,000 health services nationally, including hundreds of government-owned providers, there are countless fragmented systems and databases across the ecosystem that require standardization and integration. It\u2019s a significant undertaking for Setiaji and his team. \u201cDemonstrating the wide scope and importance of the initiative, our team has grown to approximately 160 employees. Operating like a startup with the backing of the Government, we move fast to help support and drive the digital vision of the ministry.\u201d   A foundational step in the transformation was the PeduliLindungi COVID-19 contact tracing app and website app which was deployed in the midst of the pandemic.  By securely integrating data from multiple sources, it helped the public protect their health with features including QR code scanning, digital screening, alerts, test results, vaccine tickets, real-time hospital bed availability, telemedicine services, and digital vaccine certificates.  The DTO used Tableau to speed up the development of its  products and needed only 1-2 weeks time to deliver these to the market depending on the complexity of the data and dashboard. For example, the Tableau platform was used to deliver four mission-critical dashboards: Vaccine Availability\n\nThis feature made it quick and simple for Indonesians to access the national vaccine program. It also enabled the Government to monitor and optimize delivery rates. Because of technology, supported by relevant stakeholders from regulators and health workers in the field, in the crisis time to boost vaccination rate from June to December 2021, Ministry of Health achieved up to 2 million vaccination per day and the average vaccination rate increased up to 1 million per day. COVID-19 Situation Assessment\n\nThis real-time dashboard assessed the level of community activity restrictions in each region to help people respond to outbreaks, and determine where further intervention was needed.  Comorbid Data on Elderly Patients\n\nThis report collated information on vulnerable patients who had COVID-19 on top of existing conditions, to prioritize health care responses to reduce severe illness and deaths. Public Areas and Transport Monitoring\n\nThis color-coded visualization dashboard monitored user activity and public health protocol compliance during the pandemic.   When handling sensitive and personal health data of patients and providers, there is no room for compromise on protection. The Indonesian health care platform requires strict technical and operational processes to meet relevant HIPAA regulations and ISO certifications. Trusted by enterprises globally with robust data protections built in, Tableau streamlines data governance, security and compliance across the analytics lifecycle to provide a trusted environment. \u201cOur most important role is to continue to develop a platform capable of integrating data from the 60,000+ health services right across the ecosystem nationally,\u201d explains Setiaji. \u201cWith the shifting status of COVID-19 from pandemic to endemic and beyond, it\u2019s time for us to refocus on health transformation for the betterment of Indonesia more broadly,\u201d says Setiaji. \u201cThe pandemic has accelerated the appetite for digital transformation in health, and it\u2019s one of our key national agenda items. The public and healthcare professionals are more open than ever to embrace change, and we have the technology widely available to make it happen,\u201d he said.  The widely used PeduliLindungi application is evolving into a general health solution that stores personal electronic medical records for all Indonesians based on their consents. Users can access their health reports and get personalized recommendations to maintain optimal health.  Having centralized data will also enable comprehensive health data to inform policy analysis and improve delivery of quality health services, products and medicines across the supply chain. During the pandemic supply shortages, the use of data has helped the Ministry of Health to monitor the availability of medications and supplies while ensuring those were accessible to people in need. \u201cIt is also important that we continue to educate and prepare our leaders, team and health workers to improve their data literacy and understanding of how technology can deliver better outcomes for everyone,\u201d concluded Setiaji."

To start, True rolled out a small data analytics project in their telesales department to create near real-time reports to monitor agents\u2019 sales performance.  \u201cUsing Tableau, we quickly created a dashboard that showed us at-a-glance products sold, revenue and how agents were tracking to achieve their sales targets. This is very helpful to motivate sales people, but even more importantly it enables sales managers to monitor and optimize the performance of their staff individually and as a group.\u201d Equipped with the latest analysis and comparisons, sales managers can now help agents improve results by sharing effective techniques from high performers.   Following the success of the telesales project, other senior executives were keen to roll out the platform to benefit from these learnings and data analytics capabilities. While a number of departments had started to build their own analytics dashboards outside of Tableau, adoption was slow. The challenge was that they needed specialist skills to write custom code and structured query language (SQL), which made their reports complex and expensive to create, explains Techarachan. \u201cThe reason that Tableau has been embraced by managers and users so fast is that it is easy to use and access on any device.\u201d  For example, True\u2019s corporate planning and sales teams present a daily performance snapshot report to executives, which they had attempted to do using custom-coded dashboards.  As a result, True\u2019s executives have the up-to-date analytics they need to make fast, informed decisions. Plus, staff are not wasting time coding up reports and can invest their time on more valuable tasks like strategic planning and serving customers.   In his role as Head of Data Platform, Techarachan must balance usability with security. \u201cThere are significant benefits of self-service analytics, but it is essential that we maintain strict levels of data quality, integrity, governance, and security with sensitive data. For example, financial and personally identifiable information (PII), needs to be kept strictly confidential,\u201d said Techarachan. True is protected by Tableau\u2019s enterprise-grade security including trusted authentication and access controls to manage users\u2019 login rights and permission filters down to row level security (RLS) to define who can access or download data. On top of this, Tableau removes the need to share files and information via email between users and departments, a process which causes issues for data consistency, version control and security, adds Techarachan. For example, sales can share validated data feeds with the commercial division to use in their own dashboards, reports and forecasts. Each department can determine precisely which data set is accessible, and dashboards can be refreshed to automatically display the latest figures, direct from the source. This synchronization eliminates time-consuming manual data entry, out-of-date reports and human error.   A major benefit of Tableau is that business users no longer need to rely on the IT department to develop dashboards, which makes it easier for them to build exactly what they want.  Plus, the technical team doesn\u2019t waste time coding reporting dashboards, which gives them more time to work on products and customer support. Everyone can focus on what they are good at. \u201cWe are now championing the use of data across the business by running training to enable self-service analytics and encourage the adoption of Tableau across more departments and applications,\u201d says Techarachan.   \u201cWith the help of Tableau, we integrate data from more than 100 sources across the business and we can relate or link information from one source to another to build the insights we need.\u201d As more team members and executives create and share Tableau dashboards, more business units are discovering the power of the platform.  This all helps to position True as a data-driven business equipped to thrive in a fast-changing telecommunications market."

        "title": "UniCredit, one of Italy\u2019s largest banks, gets proactive about finding and upskilling talent with richer data analytics\u00a0for HR",
        "company": "Unicredit",
        "content": "UniCredit is a commercial pan-European bank serving more than 15 million corporate and individual customers, with a unique service offering in Italy, Germany, Central and Eastern Europe. It aims to empower communities to progress, delivering the best-in-class for all stakeholders and unlocking the potential of clients and people across Europe. With around 80k global employees, Italy is by far the largest employee region, employing around 35k people.  It\u2019s no surprise, then, that when the bank kicked off an initiative to empower decision-makers with analytics to understand workforce evolution, it started from its largest region. UniCredit has leveraged the power of Salesforce and Tableau across multiple business units within Network in Italy. We spoke to UniCredit\u2019s Emanuele Tomaselli, Group Head of Organisational Analytics and Metrics, Claudia Aquilanti, CIO Group HR and Giacomo Lucchese, Head of People, Culture Practices and Technologies to find out how Tableau supports its strategic workforce planning framework and what richer insight means for the business. Emanuele: Looking for talent is always challenging, especially when roles and skills are evolving so rapidly. We have to be strategic about finding the right candidate \u2013 it\u2019s not just about finding the best people for now, it\u2019s about finding people with the right mix of skills and competencies to achieve our business goals in the future. It is essential that we continue to nurture and retain talent at UniCredit. With this in mind, there\u2019s a big emphasis on reskilling and upskilling. That means, in addition to thousands of people joining and leaving the company at any time, there are tens of thousands of colleagues we need to support and develop to make sure we have the right skills in place to succeed as a business. Emanuele: We have a lot of data at our disposal in the People & Culture team. When we decided to put more emphasis on internal redeployment and training for skills, we needed to invest in a data-driven approach and develop a culture of working with data to implement a workforce planning strategy. Furthermore, UniCredit dabbles in analytics in a lot of departments, but we took the opportunity to lead by example and really embrace data to transform P&C. It\u2019s step one in an enterprise-wide transformation.   Emanuele: Tableau is used across the business, and we were fascinated by the potential of the tool. The interactive analytics make it simple to visualise data and drill down to unlock more insights. People don\u2019t need to pull data and manually put it in thousands of slides, we have one solution that does everything. Tableau is both efficient and is something we can manage ourselves in-house. We\u2019re really proud of how we worked together to bring in new knowledge and skills \u2013 the project is a great example of business and IT teams can collaborate and combine their collective know-how for the greater good. Giacomo: Absolutely. Tableau connects with our database and does all the processing on the backend. It\u2019s easy to create user profiles and authorise access directly in Tableau. We can make sure people only see the data they need to perform well in their role, while ensuring we keep sensitive data protected. Emanuele: Tableau connects to all the main HR data sources and enriches it with data from business sources and transactional data. That gives us valuable insights that help translate our business strategy into actions for the HR team. Giacomo: Every colleague has a record. In Tableau, we can build more complete profiles and capture broad metrics such as employee performance now and over past years, such as:  their existing skills, any training they\u2019ve completed, where they\u2019re located, and projects they are currently working on. To get that level of insight before, the HR team had to manually collect data from different sources. Now we can give them a unique source of truth, which is faster and cost efficient. Claudia: There are three groups using Tableau. Firstly, my team helps build it from an IT perspective to make sure it\u2019s connected to the right sources and meeting the needs of the business. Next, there\u2019s the analytics team in the middle who prepares dashboards for the third group \u2013 business users. For the strategic workforce planning initiative, around 300 of them have access to Tableau insights to help them make decisions. Emanuele: The HR team needs to forecast how the workforce will evolve over the coming years. That means tracking social trends such as when people retire, and which regions have aging populations. They can then play with that data to understand offices or branches that are at risk of losing talent to retirement and take action. When they start staffing, they can also easily identify where the skills gaps will be, and any existing colleagues they can upskill. We also use Tableau to better design our roles and competencies. We\u2019ve developed a Group catalogue with skills assigned to each role and we use Tableau to finetune them it\u2019s helping us to plan better and facilitate career paths that will be attractive to new recruits. Emanuele: It\u2019s changed the way we run meetings. Previously, the team could only create static reports and present them. If someone asked tough questions during the meeting, we\u2019d have to go back to the office, re-analyse the data and have the same meeting again. Now, we\u2019ve empowered decision-makers to understand multiple different scenarios from the same data. Everyone can be more productive during meetings and reach those important decisions faster. Emanuele: The first part of the project was focused mainly on the Italian region, so now we\u2019re working on scaling it to Group level. It\u2019s not as simple as just rolling it out everywhere, we have different regional privacy regulations to comply with. Luckily Tableau gives us the flexibility to establish best practices around data while empowering other regions to adapt the solution for their own HR needs."

        "title": "Leading Employee Experience company, Tivian, uses embedded analytics to allow customers to self-service effectively",
        "company": "Tivian",
        "content": "Tivian is a leader in Employee Experience with over 20 years of expertise working with Europe\u2019s largest companies. The company is powered not only by technology, but by the belief that employee experience matters and since its founding in 2007 has demonstrated that businesses get better when they listen, learn and leverage insight to improve. For the past 7 years Tivian has incorporated Tableau and evolved from presenting raw data outputs to self-service embedded analytics into an integral part of the overall solution as reporting demand rapidly grew. Tableau Embedded Analytics help Tivian to create a seamless process which allows their customers to self-service their own analytical needs. As a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company, Tivian faces the challenge of staying ahead of the curve when it comes to the functionality and services they offer. \u201cWe are constantly evolving our enterprise platform, for example bringing in AI and Machine Learning to transform our offering, \u201d says David Kellas, Global Head of Consultancy for Tivian. With ever growing volumes of data and increasingly complex methods of analysis it is crucial to remain performant, easy to use, and competitive. Tivian brought in Tableau to do just that, utilising embedded analytics to integrate with their platform called DiscoverXI. Tableau Server provides a conduit to ferry data from customer projects into their database, generating all necessary user privileges on the Tableau Server and standardising Tivian\u2019s datasource generation\u2013placing a ready made datasource on the Tableau Server. David admits that initially this was a more manual process with a heavier emphasis on coding a page to embed the dashboard within, thus requiring expert knowledge. However, with Tableau added to the equation this has now evolved into a highly customisable drag and drop style interface where customers can easily build and customise their own portal with very little coding knowledge, and allows them to serve up their dashboard results to their user base. \"This is a clear advantage and avoids having to manually export data to other solutions, it also makes it easier for us to validate results, make changes, resynchronise our data and importantly maintain security for our clients due to the level of control this provides us.\" Being a company that emphasises and empowers other organisations to provide the best experience possible for their customers, it is equally as important for Tivian to provide the highest level of service for its own customers\u2014David expressed how implementing Tableau\u2019s embedded analytics allowed Tivian to brand solutions to suit any customer, whilst making the experience seamless for their end users. More often than not Tivian\u2019s Business Intelligence (BI) team are called in to develop the more bespoke data solutions for their customers - the type of solution often varies from project to project. \u201cWe have situations for example in retail where poor end customer experiences may be due to employee issues that can be resolved by correlating to the key issues. Improve employee experience, improve customer experience, drive sales\u201d, remarks David. There are instances where Tivian will combine multiple customer projects to construct benchmark data sources, allowing customers to then feed these back into future projects hence growing their footprint over time and always improving the quality of the data. They have also developed comprehensive Leadership solutions for organisations to gain insight across their business into how their leaders are performing, with data coming from multiple groups. \u201cThis insight helps to inform necessary actions that improve the experience across the board for all employees\u201d, explains David. The feedback received from customers about Tivian\u2019s embedded solution has been positive. One of the benefits of Tableau's embedded solution was how quickly Tivian were able to deploy it. \u201cThe first iteration was done relatively quickly with a Tableau implementation partner and Tivian\u2019s development team so that the first customers were able to use embedded Tableau dashboards within a quarter\u201d, highlights David. Implementing Tableau Server has allowed customers who are already aware of Tableau to get up to speed with Tivian\u2019s DiscoverXI solution much quicker and become self-sufficient \u2013 which naturally helps Tivian retain their customers. \u201cThanks to our level of in-house experience and Tableau knowledge, we are often able to translate complex customer requirements into a bespoke and useful solution \u2013 this puts us in high regard as we are not fixed to prescribing a single method or output. Our flexibility keeps us sticky,\u201d explains David. Purchasing an embedded solution meant that Tivian were able to deploy immediately, versus building an in-house solution. \u201cThere is no point reinventing the wheel when you can add best in class facilities that are also recognised across the industry,\u201d David says. \u201cThis enables certain customers to become more independent with their data reporting on our platform as they are using solutions they may already be familiar with.\u201d Tivian are optimistic about what the future holds with Tableau \u2013 \u201cwe are hoping to create more sophisticated use cases beyond descriptive statistics, using forecast models and new AI / ML services being added recently\u201d, says David. New self-service options like metrics, data explanation and ask data are being explored and could be a great addition for companies who want to benefit from Tivian experience management solutions and want to allow their in-house Tableau users to utilise Tivian\u2019s integrated solution in self-service. And in terms of advice he\u2019d provide to other data-minded businesses; \u201cSee how you can provide a seamless data and user experience for your users,\u201d says David, \u201c This will increase the acceptance of a data driven culture.\u201d"

        "content": "SIAM KUBOTA Corporation specializes in manufacturing, sales, and leasing of construction and farming equipment including agricultural drones. The business also provides after-sales service, including spare parts and onsite technical services and repairs.  Data has always been key to decision-making at SIAM KUBOTA Corporation and, with the introduction of Tableau, the business has elevated its data culture. Spreadsheets and presentations have been replaced with 4,000 live dashboards which can be accessed in real-time by those who need them. This includes manufacturing, sales, service, HR, and accounting teams as well as the business\u2019 dealers. With SIAM KUBOTA Corporation\u2019s previous approach to analytics, it took hours of manual effort to model data and create dashboards for decision making. The business deployed Tableau to increase the ease and speed of analytics so that it could leverage its benefits more fully. Starting with Tableau Server SIAM KUBOTA quickly moved to Tableau Cloud to take advantage of the scalable processing power and automatic upgrades. It also made it easy to manage data governance with features like permissions management. \u201cRather than continually updating dashboards for the same use case, we can build one dashboard that can be refreshed automatically,\u201d said Srisupundit. \u201cIt means our stakeholders no longer need to wait for data. With Tableau Cloud, people can just log on and all the information they need is there and can be viewed all on one page.\u201d   SIAM KUBOTA Corporation went live with Tableau in April 2020 and one of the first dashboards created was used to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on employees. The company has 3,000 employees and wanted to know on a daily basis whether they were healthy or had any symptoms. A Google Form was set up with a short questionnaire for employees to complete daily and the results were initially compiled manually. Automating this process with Tableau saved the company a half-day, every day on analysis. The business now has a number of internal use cases for Tableau including sales forecasting, monitoring manufacturing lines, customer segmentation analysis, and making predictions about customer repurchase behavior. SIAM KUBOTA Corporation also uses Tableau to better collaborate with its dealer network. For example, the business shares dashboards with dealers to notify them of market movements. It also monitors and analyzes the use of farming vehicles to let dealers know when they need servicing.   In just over two years, SIAM KUBOTA Corporation has scaled its Tableau user base by 8x. Dashboards like the one created to navigate COVID-19 helped management and employees understand the value of Tableau and led to increased demand for more dashboards.  Engaging Tableau technical support to manage Tableau Cloud freed up the Digital Technology Division to focus on meeting this demand. It also meant they had more time to focus on building the business\u2019 data culture.  The Digital Technology Division plans to increase adoption and build on the business\u2019 data skills  with activities like e-learning. It also plans to introduce machine learning into the business, first to predict customer repurchase and churn and then to predict machine breakdown and forecasted production volume. Srisupundit shared that driving adoption of any new technology can be difficult for an organization, but demonstrating the value of Tableau has helped the team overcome that. "

        "company": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia",
        "content": "PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia, commonly known as BRI, is one of the largest banks in Indonesia.  As a state-owned company, BRI is an agent of development and committed to providing banking services that extend beyond the cities and into the rural areas of Indonesia. BRI\u2019s broader vision is to become the most valuable banking group in Southeast Asia and the champion of financial inclusion. BRI is data-driven in its approach to achieving these goals and has built a data culture that encompasses the entire organization. Tableau has helped to foster this culture by making data more accessible and easier for business users to explore on their own. For BRI to become a data company, it had to challenge the notion that data analytics is a task for IT only. In the past, business teams would put in a request to IT every time they needed a new report or dashboard. They then waited up to four weeks for a response as reports and dashboards were prepared using complex queries and coding. In some cases, the business would then request changes which would delay delivery even more\u2014sometimes to the extent that the dashboard was no longer required by the time it was complete. BRI wanted to enable faster delivery of data to business teams and build a foundation for self-service analytics. The company started by rolling out Tableau within IT and using it to create dashboards for the business. It then began to build data literacy across the organization. \u201cTableau helped us implement our self-service strategy and make it possible for non-IT users to independently explore data and extract insights on their own,\u201d said Kukuh. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to know a query language as Tableau makes data exploration as easy as dragging and dropping.\u201dOne of the keys to the success in BRI\u2019s data journey is that its data specialists have worked closely with business users to develop solutions that best meet their needs. Currently, BRI runs a program called \u201cPendekar Data\u201d (Data Warriors) to boost data literacy. This program includes training for the business and is supported by a network of data champions. As a result of the training, business users are equipped to analyze data on their own using Tableau. One of the connected datasets allows users to analyze the performance of BRI\u2019s Savings Portfolio, including month-on-month growth of each type of savings account. By using this dataset, the business unit can analyze and measure the impact of related marketing campaigns. They can also carry out simulations and projections on their own, rather than demanding support from the data engineering teams.  Currently, there are more than ten datasets connected to Tableau which are used by 18 divisions for self-service analytics. These include the Mass Funding Division and Performance Management Division which actively use Tableau to inform key decisions.  The number of dashboards and users also continues to grow. By the end of 2023, BRI plans to have 150 new Data Warriors to drive data initiatives within each business unit.  "

        "company": "SmartNews Japan",
        "content": "SmartNews, Inc. coordinates with national newspapers and other news media and operates \"SmartNews,\" a smartphone app that delivers personalized news that is trending online. In 2014, it began operations in the U.S., and the app has now been downloaded over 50 million times by users around the globe. It is now known as the news app with the highest average per-user monthly usage time. In the future, it is looking to expand its services to all regions and languages. The SmartNews app is free to use, generating revenue through advertising. SmartNews has agreements with various media to provide appealing news content and offers users greater ease of use, while at the same time focusing on optimizing ad delivery. To maintain the proper balance, it is vital to visualize and analyze data such as logs, which are all recorded in digital form. As KPI, it uses app user data such as MAU (monthly active users), WAU (weekly active users), and DAU (daily active users), article impressions, clicks, ad impressions, views, and other key figures. These are used in various ways, and almost every department in the company requires KPI monitoring and data analysis capabilities. SmartNews has an established culture of using dashboards in all kinds of situations. For example, when performing A/B testing with the aim of improving the app, a dashboard is created to visualize models for maximizing ad revenue and creating more usable designs. It tries to look at things from a variety of perspectives to find better solutions.   Almost all of SmartNews's employees worldwide utilize Tableau Online and Tableau Data Management to visualize and analyze all kinds of data related to their work. Since the company was established, it has had a data-driven culture, and by providing all employees with the flexible Tableau environment, it aims to deepen this culture. The majority of the data used in its operations is stored in a Hive data warehouse built on Hadoop and is normalized with Presto Hive Connector. Tableau can link not only to this main data warehouse, but also to other sources, freely extracting data as needed and displaying it visually in a dashboard. To promote greater use of Tableau, it prepared roughly 50 documents on topics such as how to create dashboards and how to connect to databases. It also created an extensive FAQ and a dedicated Slack channel. 632 employees have logged in within the past 90 days. For 150 heavy users, such as data scientists and BI analysts, it provides Tableau Creator licenses, which make it possible to use advanced functions such as connecting to data sources. \"It's only been 8 months since we began full-fledged use of Tableau, but everyone is using it so much that we're already reaching the limits of our storage,\" says Kuan Li. Before deploying Tableau, SmartNews had been a long-time user of a global BI platform. However, in 2021, the service announced that it would be shutting down. The tools provided by the service were essential to SmartNews's business, so it was vital that the company find a solution to replace it. \"I didn't want to go through that ever again,\" recalls Li. \"For the replacement, we needed to choose a tool that we could trust wouldn't be discontinued.\" SmartNews compared and considered three tools. After a two-month trial period, it chose Tableau based on a holistic evaluation that included the fact that Tableau could be used with peace of mind, the richness of its functions, its look and feel, and its usability. The migration phase was roughly four months long. Some of the company's existing forms issued complex queries, so the study took time. Three members of Li's team worked on the project full-time. They were joined by contract employees that assisted with the migration, forming a 20-person migration team. This team completed its project of migrating 3,000 forms used by the previous tool.   With the tool previously used by the company, the data logic and screen presentation were integrated. Because of that, expressing something required complex logic to be constantly running in the background. Tableau, on the other hand, excels at the simple extraction of data from data sources and its visualization. \"I feel like Tableau's basic approach is similar to that of Excel,\" says Li. Of course, Tableau is also capable of complex analysis, and it provides even greater performance through the attention it pays to the data source end. Tableau offers far superior expression capabilities, and comes with various expression formats by default. By retaining data in a polished form, it is able to provide users with the information they need in a more visual, easier to understand way than was possible before. Being able to fully use its flow assists in this area. It has been well-received for just how easy it is to understand and its ability to efficiently prepare data. When users encounter specific issues as they use Tableau more extensively, or when they are unsure about how to visually express data, they can post questions to \"Tableau Community,\" a community of users. The community can often resolve these issues. \"Tableau is widely used, so it's also possible to find solutions by Googling them. Of course, during any migration process, there will be some dissatisfaction until people get used to the new system, so there was some of that. However, some employees had been using Tableau at previous jobs, and many employees have an understanding of SQL, so people grew comfortable using it even faster than we had expected,\" says Li. The most pressing issue facing SmartNews is storage space. This problem is the result of the unexpected speed with which employees have taken up Tableau. At one point, 400 dashboards were created in a single week. The company is rapidly working to resolve this problem. Getting users to use Tableau at an even deeper level is another major challenge. SmartNews is working to enhance its coordination with the Tableau Customer Success Team so that not only heavy users with Creator licenses, but also regular users with Viewer licenses, who can only view existing dashboards, are able to use Tableau more efficiently."

        "company": "Yahoo Japan",
        "content": "Yahoo Japan Corporation was launched as the internet\u2019s first Japanese-language search engine and has since become one of the country\u2019s largest comprehensive information sites with close to 100 different services, including commerce, news, and travel. The site serves more than 86 million end-users per month who generate a vast amount of data. Yahoo Japan Corporation refers to this data as multi-big data and uses it to improve service delivery and drive business growth.  Yahoo Japan Corporation turned to Tableau in 2017 to quickly and easily derive insights from its multi-big data. The company started with just 20 users and has increased this to 5,400 with a comprehensive program of enablement. These employees are now equipped to make faster, data-driven decisions leading to outcomes such as an increase in advertising orders.   Yahoo Japan Corporation previously analyzed multi-big data with tools developed in-house. However, the company wanted to speed up analysis to quickly identify and respond to market changes. It also wanted a solution to reduce reporting time and support future analytical needs. Tableau presented a solution to all these challenges and Yahoo Japan Corporation deployed it to one division to start before rolling it out across the company. The company also set up a Center of Excellence (CoE) to drive adoption. The CoE initially offered monthly training sessions on Tableau. Then, as demand increased, the CoE introduced the Skill Belt program and brought training online. \u201cYahoo Japan Corporation\u2019s Skill Belt is an active learning and unification program based on three main elements. First, there is a wealth of content to help employees improve their analytics skills. Second, learning is supported through gamification. Third, employees can visualize how they are performing against others,\u201d said Ayako Nagano, Tableau CoE Specialist, Data Application Division, Data Group at Yahoo Japan Corporation. The Skill Belt program includes eight courses and 150 training modules that cater to new and more advanced users of Tableau. The eight courses include separate courses for Viewers and Creators, Visual Best Practice, Tableau Prep, Data Solutions, Site Admin, Features, and Yahoo Japan Corporation Tableau Ambassador. The Skill Belt program allows employees to learn at their own pace. They can start by understanding how Tableau works before learning practical information like how to connect to company-specific databases. Employees can also earn points and level up as they complete different modules and courses. This has fostered friendly competition and contributed to the collective completion of 15,000 training modules to date.   The Skill Belt program equips employees with the essential skills they need to make sense of their data. However, the CoE wanted to go beyond delivering the essentials and help employees get more value from Tableau. The team implemented three measures to augment the online learning available through its Skill Belt program. The first was a campaign to encourage individuals and teams to share their best tips with other users. The second was a viz contest to promote best practice in data visualization. The third was a Tableau Ambassador at Yahoo Japan Corporation. This program continues to run today and includes seminars and events for those who want to extend on the learning available through the Skill Belt program.   Employees across Yahoo Japan Corporation now use Tableau to understand and take action on their data. For example, the company\u2019s advertising business unit has created dashboards to inform planning activities and sales negotiations. The dashboards have helped the business unit reduce time spent on reporting by 70%. This time is now spent generating more sales proposals and securing more orders. Insights from Tableau have also helped increase the efficiency of the company\u2019s PDCA cycle, contributing to a savings of 1,500 hours per year in a six-person team alone. In addition to saving time through automation, Tableau has enabled Yahoo Japan Corporation to combine its internal data with external social and market data. As a result, the company is able to discover new insights to inform its sales proposals."

        "content": "DT One (previously TransferTo) is the world\u2019s largest network of non-cash micropayments and digital pre-pay partners, operating across more than 160 countries with more than 1,800 partners in the ecosystem. The company was founded in 2005 to provide mobile carriers with the infrastructure and services they need to help migrant workers stay in touch with their family and friends back home. Today, DT One provides access to digital communications for more than five billion people across emerging economies, with a mission to leave no one unconnected and enable active participation in the global economy. Underpinning these goals, DT One is on a journey towards operational excellence that includes transforming how it consumes data. Leveraging Tableau, DT One has retired all legacy analytics tools and created a single source of data and insight.   DT One has always been data-driven. Its challenge was the inefficiency of extracting insight from its vast amount of data. \u201cWe have a large database of transactional information that previously consumed data from multiple sources, and there were a lot of constraints around the filtering, extracting, and presentation of that data,\u201d said Nidhi Damania, Head of FP&A and BI at DT One. DT One wanted a better and easier way to analyze data, including network traffic, customer transactions, and financial metrics. Tableau stood out from the competition due to its range of features and ease of implementation. The Tableau team also provided valuable advice on how DT ONE could accelerate its business intelligence capabilities. The rollout of Tableau started with the creation of a single dashboard for the sales team to monitor business performance. This was followed by training and the introduction of more dashboards as DT ONE set to work building a centralized data platform that allows Tableau to consume data from PostgreSQL, AWS Athena, AWS Redshift, and spreadsheets. This has provided DT One with a single source of truth across its entire operations. It has also significantly increased efficiency, enabling the FP&A and BI team to spend time adding true value to the business rather than just churning out reports. DT One decommissioned its legacy analytics tools nearly one year after deploying Tableau. This served as a catalyst to boost adoption and DT One now has over 100 dashboards, ranging from periodic performance reports to specific topic analysis. There are also daily reports sent to over 50% of employees. These include employees across sales, marketing, and finance and senior management who use Tableau to understand performance and uncover trends in market and customer behavior. For example, the company\u2019s C-level executives\u2014 including CFO and CRO \u2014 start their day by opening up Tableau to inform priorities and decisions. Putting these analytics capabilities into the hands of non-technical employees has increased sharing and visibility of business data and led to greater agility and coordination across business groups. In addition, sales reps can see at a glance how their numbers are tracking, with data pulled and blended dynamically from multiple sources. These outcomes would not be possible if not for the efforts of a very lean and efficient BI team which has layered Tableau and other data-consuming infrastructure on top of the internally built centralized data platform."

        "content": "FUJIFILM Corporation Graphic Communication Business Division\u2019s primary products include the Jet Press series of inkjet digital printers, widely used at printing companies and elsewhere, as well as commercial printing equipment and related solutions. The Graphic Communication Business Division\u2019s daily operations include research and development of these products, technical evaluations, and after-sales services. In these businesses, collection and analysis of usage data and error data from clients\u2019 printing equipment is essential. In the 2010s, engineers in the Graphic Communication Business Division began utilizing data in development and preventive maintenance by downloading log data stored on dedicated websites and using Excel macros to analyze it. However, those efforts ran into many issues. Kosuke Taguchi, Chief of the Service Solutions Group in the Graphic Communication Business Division, reflected on that era as follows. \u201cThe conventional process required around an hour to download log data for one piece of printing equipment, then another hour to import that into Excel and create a PDF visualization. The inconvenience of the process made it extremely unpopular. Building and managing software for data collection and analysis cost tens of millions of yen for waterfall-style development, then tens of millions of yen again to make improvements. We always had a desire to free ourselves from that state of affairs using BI tools.\u201d   The number of FUJIFILM staff using Tableau began to increase internally around 2015. In 2019, FUJIFILM decided to deploy Tableau with the aim of transitioning from traditional BI to self-service BI. Latching on to this trend, the Graphic Communication Business Division also began the full-fledged implementation and utilization of Tableau. In around four months, the Graphic Communication Business Division went from considering Tableau implementation to initiating rollout, and they immediately set to work visualizing log data for their main product, Jet Press inkjet digital printers. Hiromichi Watanabe of the Service Solutions Group described it as follows. \u201cWe pulled printing equipment log data from servers and connected to Tableau via Tableau Bridge for visualization and analysis. This log data included how much ink customers used, the size and thickness of paper used, how many sheets were printed, and any errors that occurred. Using Tableau improved the speed of data access and visualization tremendously compared to our conventional systems.\u201d Kazumasa Hattori of the DS Quality Assurance and Services Group in the Graphic Communication Business Division described Tableau\u2019s usefulness in after-sales services as follows. \u201cIn the past, staff were dispatched for repairs whenever a customer\u2019s printing equipment broke down, which both took time and incurred personnel costs. We had been collecting log data from printing equipment since around 2010, but we were not making good use of it. With Tableau, we were able to rapidly analyze data to pick up predictors of breakdowns and act to prevent breakdowns during regular on-site maintenance, and this helped us reduce customers\u2019 equipment downtime.\u201d One of the reasons Taguchi gives for deciding on Tableau is its intuitive control scheme. \u201cEven without looking at a manual, I could easily figure out how to make Tableau do what I want. The control scheme is very intuitive. That simplicity and accessibility were attractive to us.\u201d Hattori also pointed to the degree of freedom possible in Viz creation as another reason for choosing Tableau. \u201cSome of the major benefits of Tableau are that you can create beautiful visualizations (Viz) on your own and easily make changes. Moreover, anyone can view the data as long as they have a license, and you can transmit information through either regular broadcasts or alert functionality. I am really fond of how easy it is to share information and the hands-off functionality.\u201d Other factors behind the decision to implement Tableau included the fact that Tableau can handle much greater data volumes than Excel, and that once a Viz is created, there is no need to re-do it even if more data is added. Moreover, Tableau is feature-rich and frequently receives updates that add more features, plus it is capable of deep, multilateral data analysis. Hattori described the quantitative benefits of Tableau Implementation as follows. \u201cWith traditional BI, the Software Department was needed to develop or revise even one Viz, and this meant that necessary lead times were on the order of several weeks. However, now it only takes an hour to create or revise a Viz, and we already have hundreds of visualizations available.\u201d Another big benefit is that Tableau reduces the amount of time it takes to go from collecting the data to visualizing it, which enables rapid analysis, said Watanabe. \u201cSince printing equipment produces a lot of data, it used to take a tremendous amount of time to collect and import that data. For example, it is necessary to collect and analyze billions of lines of data on inkjet printheads, but with Tableau you can produce a list of results of such calculations with the press of a button. This alone saves roughly 250 hours of work per year.\u201d Although the quantitative benefits are wonderful, Taguchi emphasized that even more important was how Tableau enabled initiatives that were previously impossible. After deploying Tableau, the Graphic Communication Business Division proceeded to launch one new initiative after another. \u201cOne such initiative was optimizing our parts inventory. There is massive variety and volume in printing equipment parts. With our conventional systems, it took a lot of time to determine what parts inventories were in which areas across the globe, and there was a problem with disparities in inventories from location to location. Tableau enables us to visualize the current status of inventories so we can have locations coordinate and correct their inventories together.\u201d \u201cBenefits like the more rapid inkjet printhead analysis mentioned earlier have a tremendous impact if they are possible, but things in this area were long thought to be impossible. The fact that Tableau suddenly enabled us to do these things was so surprising that everyone was a bit taken aback. It was from that point that everyone accepted this new tool called Tableau all at once. This was a true breakthrough, breaking through the barrier people had built up in their minds.\u201d Having made the comments above, Taguchi expects even more Tableau utilization to come in the future. \u201cThe successful example of the Jet Press did away with barriers to asking for certain kinds of data from personnel responsible for new models of products, as we say that we want to do the same thing with the new models that we did with the Jet Press. Moreover, we also get a lot of constructive comments from everyone telling us what new things they want us to do with Tableau. I really feel like we are taking big strides into the future we always envisioned in which each and every member utilizes data more and more to keep customers\u2019 equipment running stably across the globe.\u201d"

        "content": "Founded in 1979, Eigerindo is one of the largest apparel, footwear, and accessories companies in Indonesia. The company operates more than 250 stores and also sells direct to consumers online.  Like all retailers, Eigerindo needs data to manage its end-to-end operations\u2014from understanding customer preferences to managing inventory and ensuring the right products are in each store. And in a fast moving industry, this data needs to be as accurate and up-to-date as possible. That\u2019s why Eigerindo has been on a journey to transform reporting and analytics. The transformation has been championed by the company\u2019s top leadership and driven in partnership with Metrodata Group who has helped to deploy Tableau. Results to date include reduced time to insight and more accurate data to inform decision making. Eigerindo\u2019s leaders use a wealth of data points to understand and manage the company\u2019s performance. These include online and in-store transactions, HR and finance metrics, and data collected via the company\u2019s loyalty program. In the past, this data was held in silos and reported on in different formats, making it difficult to get a consolidated view of performance. In addition, manual reporting processes meant leaders often waited three days for information like daily sales figures. With support from the board of directors, Eigerindo\u2019s head of ICT approached Metrodata Group for a solution and agreed to a proof of concept (POC). To start, Metrodata Group consolidated data by connecting multiple systems to Google BigQuery. These include Eigerindo\u2019s ERP, POS, ecommerce, loyalty system, and planning system platform. Tableau was then layered on top to make it faster and easier for the data to be explored.   Eigerindo now has 15 dashboards in Tableau Cloud that track a range of key performance indicators (KPIs). These dashboards are automatically refreshed twice a day, providing leaders with more current data to make decisions. The data is more accurate as well with no more manual handling or human calculation. One dashboard tracks sales and margin which can be visualized by product group, individual item, and store. By slicing and dicing the data in this way, the company can better understand which products sell best in each store. They can also identify opportunities to improve profitability. Another key dashboard helps the company to assess effectiveness of discounts and promotions and determine whether or not increasing marketing spend will increase sales. On top of these dashboards, Metrodata Group has delivered a predictive model called Product Rolling Recommendation to help Eigerindo\u2019s business users to roll or move dead stock or slow moving items to other stores where there\u2019s a high probability for it to be sold. The model leverages data like demographics, inventory, and sales history to recommend how products are rolled or moved between stores to keep inventory healthy. Tableau provides a means for users to interact with this model and view the recommendations. Tableau has been rolled out to senior leaders first, including Eigerindo\u2019s board of directors and the head of departments like finance, retail, and procurement. The majority use Tableau to view data while a small number have been equipped to create and explore dashboards on their own. Metrodata Group has supported the adoption of Tableau by training key champions. These champions have then helped to train others, resulting in a total of 40 users onboarded. Eigerindo now has plans to build out more dashboards and predictive models and ultimately extend adoption to other areas of the business.       "

        "company": "NYU Langone Health",
        "content": "Trends in healthcare have pushed the boundaries of technology in recent years. New levels of treatment capacity, advancements in research, and evolutions in consumer demand\u2014not to mention the urgency of a global pandemic\u2014have all required an intentional response from health systems seeking to remain effective and competitive. At NYU Langone Health, an academic medical center located in New York City, Tableau plays a key role in providing platform support for the institution\u2019s larger mission of promoting a data-driven culture that empowers every person to make decisions that support the business and advance improvements in quality of care. NYU Langone operates in more than 320 locations around the New York region and in Florida. It comprises Tisch Hospital, Kimmel Pavilion, NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital, Hassenfeld Children's Hospital, NYU Langone Hospital\u2012Brooklyn, and NYU Langone Hospital\u2012Long Island, along with the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Long Island School of Medicine, and Rusk Rehabilitation Center. Throughout this widespread healthcare enterprise, care teams, administrators, data teams, executives, clinicians, and other staff have worked together to put data at the foreground of operations and innovation. \u201cHaving ways to make data accessible and applicable to physicians and clinical leadership is really one of the fundamental driving forces for us,\u201d says Dr. Ilseung Cho, NYU Langone's Chief Quality Officer. \u201cOur dashboards are really at the heart and soul of how we drive change in our organization.\u201d We took a closer look into the many ways NYU Langone achieves success with its data-driven approach to healthcare, across multiple areas of business that include quality control, financial management, research management, and payor network operations. Key professionals at the health system shared with us the many ways they're benefitting from the latest data technologies\u2014not just how they're using Tableau, but how they put data front and center in maximizing productivity and collaboration across daily operations, and how this approach helps them achieve better outcomes for patients, as well as for NYU Langone itself.   For the past 15 years, NYU Langone has followed a vision to transform itself \u201cfrom a distributed and ad-hoc management and decision-making organization\u201d to one that is \u201ccentralized, planned, and data-driven.\u201d Among the tenets of this vision are achieving quality improvements throughout the organization and democratizing access for all users. In these areas and many others, visualizing data plays an important role. \u201cI learned from my years as a researcher about the importance of using data to tell stories,\u201d said Cho. \u201cIn research, you often use storytelling to make your findings more engaging with people who aren't familiar. This skill has translated well to the hospital, where we look at data to tell us stories about how each patient is doing, and what trends we're facing on the macro level.\u201d The continuous development and refinement of Tableau visualizations at NYU Langone has yielded powerful tools for analyzing highly relevant clinical data, such as the High Risk Care Coordination dashboard shown in Figure 1, which reports on cases for patients with at-risk conditions. More than 100 dashboards use over 800 key performance indicators to track a variety of measures, from operational analytics and hospital resource capacity, to patient census and lengths of stay, to employee safety metrics and patient experience factors, to COVID-19 leadership scorecards and detailed financial performance. These dashboards represent a myriad of data sources, which the NYU Langone team has expertly wrangled over the past decade to yield meaningful, actionable results. In all instances, the dashboards present the vital capability of drilling down from high-level analysis to various case-level and demographic details. This capability is especially important to one of the hospital's data culture goals: scaling down analytics capabilities to make them truly accessible to all. The trends shown at the top level of a dashboard might not resonate with users whose focus is on operating a smaller facility, for example, or catering to a specialized area of disease. By enabling users to easily sort and filter the analytics, NYU Langone's dashboards provide insights at all necessary levels of engagement. According to Cho, a key value that data visualization provides is positioning every employee at NYU Langone to do even better work in pursuit of the overall mission. When all users can see and relate to data, they are in the best mindset to fine-tune the ways they perform so that they can achieve better outcomes for patients and for the health system overall.  \u201cBased on what we see in our dashboards, we've started putting together process measures that help inform us as precursors of bad events,\u201d said Cho. \u201cWe have measures for how our teams can best manage patients, all the way down to things like hand hygiene and timely anticoagulation. If compliance starts drifting down, we can predict that we might see more infections or other issues.\u201d In the course of pursuing these data-driven process improvements, NYU Langone also prioritizes its response to healthcare equity disparities with targeted health initiatives, better competence around language barriers, and other solutions. Cho works with the data and analytics team and others to overlay various social determinants of health factors with the process measures that drive effective clinical care, so that the health system's reach is expanded to address many areas of need, not just the ones that are most apparent. In these ways, clinical quality improvement efforts at NYU Langone are connected by another prime motivator within the health system's mission: empathy. \u201cLike many people in healthcare, I know about the importance of hospital work from personal experience with loved ones,\u201d said Cho. \u201cEvery time we meet a patient or encounter their case, we're reminded: Somebody loves this person, and they've entrusted us with their care. So we have an obligation to listen to the patient experience and achieve equity in treatment wherever we can.\u201d Another important vector for quality management has been the integration of technology, including metric definitions and data systems, into shared platforms across departments. Jeff Shein, Senior Director of Data and Analytics, has been instrumental in promoting multiple cross-functional, data-driven initiatives, including a decision support and value improvement team for driving operational, financial, and clinical value through data and collaboration; and a reporting and metrics subcommittee for ensuring consistent, accountable data governance. \u201cEmpowering everyone at the hospital to be familiar with the data really streamlines the sharing of information and knowledge, both generally and on a case-specific basis,\u201d said Shein. \u201cI was recently a patient of another hospital in a different system, and over the course of my visit, six people asked me the same exact questions about my health data. That doesn't happen here at NYU Langone.\u201d Data analysis also plays a key role in managing financial activities at NYU Langone, including tracking ROI, providing executive visibility into financial performance, and predicting caseloads and other economic drivers. The fiscal health of the organization depends on the well-rounded collection and analysis of financial data, including payor receivables, revenue cycles, purchasing, payroll, contractor relations, and clinical activity. Tools such as the One Finance: Enterprise to Department dashboard, provide summary and detailed information to all organizational levels, from executives down to individual care team members, enabling insights into operating margins, revenue, expenses, and service volume. NYU Langone also uses Tableau to predict future readings of this data so that leadership and other decision makers can plan and adjust their budgets accordingly. \u201cOur organization has a real thirst for using data to drive decisions, and at the same time, we're hyper-focused on performance,\u201d said Steve Chatfield, Assistant Vice President in Finance, reporting directly to the Chief Financial Officer. \u201cSo it's a cultural thing that you're expected to know the data in order to stay on top of expenses and trends, and to be accountable for knowing about issues before the people higher up ask questions. Jeff's team does a great job in providing the data sources so our Finance team can develop the dashboards.\u201d Some of the dashboards help to further promote this accountability by ranking physician performance. Among other benefits, this tactic helps identify opportunities for documenting patient conditions, which in turn ensures accurate reimbursement and quality rankings. Visual analysis in Tableau enables this to be a much more dynamic, proactive process than it was in years past. \u201cPreviously, we'd produce all these ad hoc reports,\u201d said Chatfield. \u201cAt meetings, we'd identify a blip or a bubble, and everyone would sit around and wonder: What's behind that? We'd have to take it away, investigate it, and then meet again one week later to discuss. Now, we simply click on it, and there you go\u2014the discussion can continue in real time.\u201d At the most basic level, Chatfield says, the successful use of his organization's Tableau dashboards boils down to two things: ease of adoption, and using the data to set near-term goals. \u201cMake the dashboard so easy that a five-year-old would understand it,\u201d he recommends. \u201cSomeone shouldn't have to spend more than a minute looking at it to understand what it's saying. Then, figure out how the data you're seeing will help you explain your progress toward certain financial or other performance goals, such as a physician's clinical documentation target, or contribution margin goal.\u201d During the COVID-19 pandemic, data visualization was critical for tracking to unique variables that were often difficult to predict. These included such phenomena as baby deliveries, which most personnel expected to spike but which actually receded as families reexamined their priorities; and deferments of elective procedures, a necessary capacity measure with tricky consequences for NYU Langone and its patients, and with very little certainty around duration. COVID-19 also brought about radical swings in payor mix accounting, as patients left jobs, went on unemployment, or transferred to Medicaid. Dashboards at NYU Langone carefully tracked these trends as well. Research is another key area where data is crucial for the accurate tracking, development, and management of funds. NYU Langone is a national leader in clinical, computational, and basic science research, and uses Tableau dashboards to track research finances for three main purposes: managing resources, measuring productivity, and targeting growth. On the growth side, making data clear and available to researchers and executives has produced highly positive results, boosting NYU Langone's ranking within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding portfolio from 38th in the mid-2000s to being the top-ranked School of Medicine for NIH funding in the country in 2021. (Part of this increase was due to an unusually large $448 million grant for running a national post-COVID-to-long-COVID program, but even without this grant, their ranking would have been 16th.) The correlation of research growth to data analysis comes from using dashboards to visually track performance at the facility and faculty levels, which can then be used to deliver compelling reporting on that performance in order to seek more funds. In this way, the data culture in NYU Langone's research community is comprehensive throughout all activities they pursue. \u201cAlong with tracking the performance factors that drive our institutional growth, we're also using Tableau to steward all of our resources effectively,\u201d said Laura Boughton, Senior VP for Research. \u201cWith constant visibility into the data, we can manage our research resources effectively, measure the performance of our facilities and people, and then fund projects and compensation based on performance relative to our goals.\u201d This data-driven model helps to maintain alignment with NYU Langone's success overall, by staying focused on the larger mission while cultivating growth, accountability, and innovation in its research arm. \u201cIt's about culture change, essentially,\u201d said Boughton. \u201cTraditionally, academic funding has followed a more old-fashioned model. Now, we're using data to help clarify expectations for faculty\u2014the people who actually generate research growth\u2014and giving each of them visibility into where their individual performance stands relative to those expectations.\u201d Population health management and payor network integration represents yet another area where finances, operations, clinical activity, and patient outcomes intersect over the thoughtful management and presentation of relevant data at NYU Langone. NYU Langone\u2019s clinically integrated network, NYUPN, actively manages more than 500,000 lives through shared savings contracts with seven managed care plans including commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid product lines. The task of managing the health of a population and associated financials is complex, given that the data takes many forms: claims data, patient rosters, contract and eligibility details for all patients in all plans, pharmacy files, and quality files that reference potential and actual gaps in care. Differing file formats, data schemas, and naming conventions for each payor add further complexity, as does the reality of different payors providing information on different cadences at different times of each month. In the past, manual juggling of all this data made for chaotic, often unproductive, payor operations. To address the need for clarity, and to put the health system in a proactive stance for addressing communications and performance, NYU Langone embarked on a multi-year, in-depth strategic initiative focused on using payor data in better ways to make more informed decisions. \u201cThe old way was not sustainable, especially considering we're always growing, we're engaging in new contracts with payors, plus taking on more patients and more providers\u2014and so the complexity continued to grow,\u201d said Carrie Rooke, Senior Director of Operations for Network Integration. \u201cWe needed a better way of linking things on the back end, and getting accurate, workable data in front of us every day. That's where the IT and business teams really came to the table and said: How do we get this done?\u201d The solution was to devise better ways of aggregating and normalizing the multitude of data types and formats, and then build dashboards in Tableau that enable visual analytics to drive action. The project involved not only cleaning up the payor data, but also overlaying it with clinical data in Epic in order to drive insights on the level of individual patients. For example, if a patient recently had a mammogram, this fact would show up in the data immediately, and the system wouldn't trigger an unnecessary reminder to reach out about the test being due. This level of data integration at both the software interface and human interface levels generates new kinds of efficiency for Rooke's team when conducting outreach activities across the payor and clinical networks. Tableau dashboards produce accurate summary views and action lists based on timely, paid services patients might need. Precision in the data roll-ups that enable drill-down capability into details help the staff hit strategic targets and track both patient and in-house communications such that no cases get missed. Having data and insights readily at hand also confers greater authority on NYU Langone as an organization, positioning them to hold payors accountable for errors or omissions in the data they provide, as well as to pursue more relevant conversations with the patients themselves. Rooke cited a few recent examples. \u201cIn 2020, we identified a massive data gap with one of our payors, and because we were organized on our side and could visually present our data, we were able to make them clearly accountable for correcting the situation,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the flip side, we recently attracted the attention of executives at one of our health plans based on how we use Tableau, and that has generated a lot of excitement about new use cases that we can all apply to achieve even greater levels of collaboration and measurable improvement.\u201d The ability to drive changes in the quality of payor-side data structures while continuing to improve payor operations internally has put NYU Langone on the path of getting to the new levels of efficiency and effective operations they seek. Feedback loops, data-driven conversations, increased precision, and the chance to innovate better outcomes using data analysis have all helped to transform the health system's culture into an environment where every person uses data to improve outcomes while constantly becoming better at what they do. To the leaders we've met here, the future looks bright as NYU Langone continues the journey of scaling its analytics, improving quality and ratings, and sustaining a fully data-driven culture. Progress in areas like quality management, finance, research, and payor relations shows how democratic, curated data analysis offers new levels of efficiency and productivity for the health system by enabling insights that drive smarter decisions and help identify new opportunities for improvement and growth. As ranked across 16 specialties and ten procedures and conditions by the U.S. News Best Hospitals Honor Roll, NYU Langone has been in the top ten hospitals in the country for the past three years. NYU Grossman School of Medicine is now ranked as #2 medical school in the United States, up from #34 in 2007. To help drive the infrastructure of this change, Shein's data and analytics teams have carefully focused on the governance factors that contribute to this success, including the clear definition and ownership of data metrics and the ongoing management of centralized data systems that propagate these metrics to downstream tools throughout the organization. The governance bodies Shein has helped to spearhead ensure that every metric in every Tableau dashboard has a single, published definition, with a business owner and technical owner clearly attached and accountable for maintaining the metric's calculations, as well as answering questions about its use. In other words, there's more to changing the culture than simply making vast amounts of data available to users. Unless they consistently recognize, trust, and understand the data they see, people won't buy into the changes. NYU Langone has remained aware of this fact throughout their journey, and made it a priority to always seek buy-in from the executives, clinicians, and other staff that use their Tableau dashboards and other tools. \u201cThe easy part has always been just putting the data out there,\u201d said Chatfield, the finance executive. \u201cThe bigger challenge is getting people to understand the data and use it to achieve what they want to achieve. Creating Tableau dashboards and making them easily accessible and relevant to all users has been crucial for changing NYU Langone into a more data-driven culture.\u201d Rooke's focus on payor network integration leads her to be optimistic about the future applications of Tableau and other related technologies. \u201cPredictive capabilities are a huge area we have yet to fully explore,\u201d she said. \u201cOur next wave of innovation is likely to be focused on applying more predictive logic across a larger scope of patients, so we can conduct outreach that connects with patients in the right way at the right point in time. When it comes to that kind of predictive analytics, we've only touched the surface of what we can do.\u201d Cho, the quality executive, agrees. \u201cThe best way to change behavior is to show data that illustrates where the issues are, and where we have opportunities to improve. The next mountain we have to climb is finding ways to make these opportunities more predictive in nature, so we can use data analytics and visualizations to keep us charging ahead and becoming the highest-performing, highest quality health care organization we can possibly be.\u201d"

Feeding America also supports programs that prevent food waste and improve food security among the people it serves, brings attention to the social and systemic barriers that contribute to food insecurity in our nation, and advocates for legislation that protects people from going hungry. \u201cFeeding America has an aspiration for this whole country,\u201d said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, Feeding America CEO. \u201cA country where no one is hungry. Where every single person has access to the foods that they prefer, and the foods that they need, in order to live rich, full lives.\u201d Feeding America member food banks safely store food and distribute it to local food programs like food pantries, soup kitchens, and shelters. To achieve its mission, Feeding America has steadily built a powerful human and transportation infrastructure on the back end. \u201cFeeding America distributed 6.6 billion meals in the middle of a global health pandemic. That does not happen without a lot of sophistication in terms of logistics,\u201d says Babineaux-Fontenot. \u201cA data-informed approach in our work is absolutely critical. It's fundamental, and it's essential.\u201d The challenge addressed by Feeding America is pervasive in every part of the country, reaching people in a wide variety of circumstances. \u201cHunger exists in every community, in every county and parish in the U.S.\u2014including the wealthy ones,\u201d says Stephanie Zidek, Senior Director of Data and Analytics at Feeding America. \u201cOne of the first things data helps our organization communicate to people is showing how widespread the hunger problem is, so we can zero in on specific needs.\u201d Katie Fitzgerald, Feeding America COO, concurs. \u201cIn our work, we like to say that we don\u2019t have a food scarcity problem in this country. We have a food access problem,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cBy harnessing data, we can unlock this problem by identifying where food insecurity exists and figuring out how to get food to those locations.\u201d Accomplishing these efforts on a major scale requires insights into the true conditions of hunger\u2014the who, what, and where. \u201cBefore we can help, we first need to understand where our neighbors are who are facing hunger, so that we can be in the right communities to serve them,\u201d said Zidek. \u201cThen, we need to understand what kind of food they need. And to be effective at all this, we need current data and a way of understanding it so we can figure out the best and fastest way to provide assistance.\u201d This informed, daily decision-making impacts Feeding America\u2019s operations at every level, from its national organization to its network of food banks, whose service areas range from one county to ninety-three counties. The data used for supporting these decisions is mostly provided by the food banks, based on questions that Feeding America asks to effectively target assistance. \u201cThere are a multitude of considerations,\u201d Zidek said. \u201cWho is living in each household\u2014what ages, what genders, what ethnicity and race? Based on that, what foods do they lack, and what do they prefer? And we ask: How can we serve each community best? What characteristics of a community affect its needs\u2014is it accessible, is there work nearby, do people travel there from far away?\u201d All of these criteria come into play as Feeding America continuously seeks to serve communities facing hunger, hone its operations, and amplify its mission. Data is at the heart of this mission. With this level of data in hand, the organization can mobilize its resources to fill each need and gather meaningful statistics on the patterns of hunger that help persuade communities and all levels of government to continue supporting their hunger relief efforts. \u201cI find myself in the position to speak across so many audiences and to so many different constituencies,\u201d said Babineaux-Fontenot. \u201cAnd I find data to be a powerful tool in every one of those conversations. Asking people questions, and then having them see their answers inside of the data that we use in order to be partners with them, it\u2019s powerful.\u201d While precise data has been instrumental in driving Feeding America\u2019s mission today, it hasn\u2019t always been there in the past. Previously, the organization relied on data from its Hunger in America study, conducted every four years. The study shed light on broad hunger trends, but although it surveyed more than 60,000 people at food programs across the country, the data it yielded remained static until the next study, four years later. \u201cThe Hunger in America study was a huge undertaking, but it only ever spoke to the reality of hunger at a specific point in time,\u201d said Zidek. \u201cWithin a short while after we conducted the study, new trends would emerge, and we\u2019d have no way of tracking them until the next study was completed. We extrapolated the best we could, but it wasn\u2019t working\u2014we needed real-time data about the people we were feeding so we could serve them more effectively.\u201d On the analytics side, insights were further limited by the static nature of spreadsheets the organization used to analyze the study data they collected. Communication with partners was likewise limited by the complexity of the Feeding America network: a group comprising thousands of food banks and partner agencies who typically lacked a clear requirement or capacity for sharing data as part of their collaboration with Feeding America and with each other. The last Hunger in America survey was released in 2014. From that time, Feeding America has worked with Tableau to integrate data from partner agencies into dashboards that provide up-to-the-minute views into areas of need, changing hunger conditions, demographic considerations, and the types of food and services needed for fulfillment. \u201cWhat is beautiful about a partnership, like the partnership we have with Tableau, is that it helps us to understand more deeply what it is that people do prefer. It helps us to understand what people need. It helps us understand whom it is that we're serving, all at once,\u201d said Babineaux-Fontenot. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful tool to have in our arsenal in this fight against hunger. Data, especially modern technology, has the potential to unlock a bright future for this country. We're excited that we get to be a part of that, and that our partnership with Tableau helps us to deepen our ability to be a part of it.\u201d Beyond simply collecting the data, Feeding America worked to make sure the wide variety of non-technical users at the national organization, food banks, and partner agencies all felt engaged with the data and excited about using it. \u201cWe\u2019re in the throes of adoption, and there\u2019s still plenty of work to do,\u201d said Fitzgerald. \u201cBut with the help of Tableau, we\u2019ve built a client service insights platform that removes barriers to using data and makes data come alive for our people so it\u2019s easy for them to understand and get the insights they need.\u201d One way for Feeding America to achieve adoption at scale was to also build on some of its member food banks\u2019 investments. The Mid-Ohio Food Collective, for example, had modernized its IT platform in ways that enabled it to share data analytics across most of the food banks in Ohio, along with a few in other states. The data analytics built on top of this technology was based on Mid-Ohio's participation in a 2016 data fellowship program through Tableau Foundation. With cooperation from Feeding America, the Mid-Ohio data collection platform was refined and expanded nationwide, becoming part of the Feeding America platform, with a constituency of users who were already familiar with the dashboards and therefore able to help others come on board. Tableau Foundation also helped Feeding America jump-start its own data modernization efforts. Zidek and her team's early Tableau dashboards were based on static data at first but have gradually upgraded to automated data feeds and electronic data collection. \u201cIt\u2019s rather stunning how much we\u2019ve advanced on our data journey in such a short window,\u201d said Babineaux-Fontenot. \u201cI can\u2019t envision a future where data is not going to be at least as important as it is today.\u201d With a powerful new platform for sharing data across the Feeding America network, and more users at more partner agency locations adopting the platform every week, efficiency and efficacy are at an all-time high. The work will not stop until its mission is accomplished to advance change in America by ensuring equitable access to nutritious food for all.  Access to data means food bank and partner agency staff and volunteers have better insights into each community\u2019s needs, right down to the individual level. For example, a person might visit a food bank not realizing they\u2019re eligible for food assistance resources, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid. With rapid access to this information, food bank employees can advise neighbors on their eligibility for these programs. And when food banks are advocating for more resources, their access to data helps empower them to have conversations about the need for change\u2014conversations that would be far less persuasive without having the data at hand. \u201cFeeding America is here to build a movement, to catalyze a movement, to inspire this country to decide that food insecurity is unacceptable,\u201d said Babineaux-Fontenot. \u201cData is helping us do that. Ensuring that communities are well positioned to thrive, and that every member in that community has the nutrition that they need in order to thrive is something that\u2019s in the interest of every person. Data helps us to tell this story in powerful ways.\u201d Looking to the near future, Zidek said that predictive analytics will increasingly become a part of Feeding America\u2019s efforts. Now that the organization has modernized the ways it collects and responds to data, her team\u2019s next steps will be to determine ways of using data that point to future scenarios for which Feeding America can plan and prepare. This will represent yet another facet of employing data and technology to serve and empower communities in need. Babineaux-Fontenot continues to embrace this philosophy as a simple truth. \u201cThere\u2019s dignity in choice,\u201d she points out. \u201cI have an aspiration, as do all of the people who do this work with us, that people who are experiencing food insecurity have the same types of luxuries around food that you have and that I have. The work with Tableau is helping us do that.\u201d Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana is a network of hunger relief agencies covering 23 parishes (counties) across southern Louisiana, from the Texas to Mississippi borders. Its service area includes most of the state\u2019s population, and includes populations that are unusually susceptible to climate and economic changes. To keep pace with demands during a time of crisis, the food bank relies on data from Feeding America\u2019s service insights platform to track areas and indicators of increased need. \u201cData plays a huge role for us,\u201d said Lindsay Hendrix, Chief Impact Officer at Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana. \u201cWe know that behind every piece of data is a person who can be dramatically impacted by the work we do. We seek to always give each person the best service we can, and we can\u2019t do that without data.\u201d During the COVID-19 pandemic, the food bank met hundreds of thousands of neighbors who needed support for the first time. Many communities were devastated by the revenue downturn in key industries like tourism, energy, and hospitality. The food bank used unemployment data to secure visibility and funding for the increase in demand, and demographic data to help focus on groups that were disproportionately affected, such as communities of color. \u201cCensus data is very important to how we respond to the needs of a particular group,\u201d said Hendrix. \u201cIf we want to best serve that community, it helps us make decisions about who best to partner with, how to conduct outreach, and many other factors.\u201d The Feeding America service insights platform gives Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana real-time data that enables them, for the first time, to report to stakeholders exactly who is being served at the food bank on a daily basis, including what zip code they\u2019re arriving from, what their family composition is, the particular foods they need, and other data that can produce insights into ways their operations can be adjusted or improved. \u201cFor example, we found that at a particular Second Harvest location in greater New Orleans, families were traveling long distances in order to access that pantry,\u201d said Hendrix. \u201cAnd we found out the reason was that it was open five days per week, which is a huge consideration for families facing hunger\u2014they need food when they need it. So, we worked with other partners to try and open up more capacity in locations that were closer to these neighbors\u2019 homes.\u201d"

        "title": "E-commerce group, MALL Group, drives profitability with Tableau",
        "company": "MALL Group ",
        "content": "This story was produced by our partner, Revolt.BI. The original version in Czech can be found here. MALL Group is the largest e-commerce group in Central and Eastern Europe, which includes dozens of online stores and services. To succeed in a highly competitive environment, it needed to transform itself into a fully data-driven organization. Tableau's visualization analytics platform played an important role in this respect, helping to achieve perfect visibility of the entire sales process and gain insight into the performance of marketing, purchasing, and other departments. MALL Group is able to extract valuable insights from its data to successfully manage all these areas. MALL Group needed to gain insight into product profitability and generally streamline the way they worked with data, democratizing it so that it could be used by everyone whom it might be helpful, and provide recipients with useful inputs for decision making. The aim was therefore to introduce a functioning data culture within the group. To foster its smooth adoption and to enable the easiest possible extraction of valuable insights from data, it is essential to enable data visualization. MALL Group therefore decided to implement Tableau analytics platform to interpret its data.  The primary task was to make respective profitability analyses of 300,000 products accessible and more transparent. For this, dozens of basic reports were created in Tableau in collaboration with Revolt BI, which enabled MALL Group member companies and their departments to track product profitability in great detail. Every morning - and sometimes more frequently - they receive granular reports on orders processed, with views from different angles and in different contexts. For instance, the sales department is interested in margins, marketing in campaign cost allocation, warehousing and operations in warehouse, transport, and supplier bonus costs. At the same time, the entire funnel is now visible in a single report. Performance teams also know exactly what is happening and can determine the impact of current activities in real time. \u201cMore intensive work with data and analytics has given us a detailed view of the profitability of individual products, which is a key aspect for e-commerce,\" says Andy Werner, Head of BI, Mall Group. \"This allows us to optimize the product mix, manage pricing and streamline marketing activities. Heeding our data to a greater extent enables us to respond to market demands faster and more effectively.\u201d Overall, Tableau has provided a better understanding of the data, showed where to allocate resources more effectively, and enabled better data-driven decisions. Being user oriented, Tableau is available to anyone to easily analyze data without involving the analytics department. This change means more agile management for the MALL Group and, as a result, a path to becoming one of the most successful data-driven companies. Change management, or the adoption of a new way of doing things, constitutes an important part of any project aimed at helping a business leverage its data. Without a data culture in place, even the best tool would not deliver the desired results. That is why MALL Group has created a comprehensive training program to make sure that all employees who are expected to use data for their work understand what the data mean and are able to extract insights. The program included a series of training sessions, educational videos and, for those interested, an introduction to more advanced Tableau features. A so-called data champion was appointed in each department to advise and assist the others with learning, analysis, and report creation.  Everyone can become an analyst on their own and prepare simple custom reports. As a result, analysts are not overwhelmed with a multitude of minor requests from users and can focus on strategic analytical goals and innovations instead. The result is a true adoption of a data culture. This has been witnessed by an increase in the number of users from 200 to 550 in a single year, over 6,000 reports created to date, and 2,500 daily views of data. This change has also contributed to the success that the MALL Group is now experiencing. \u201cWith Tableau, sales teams get the data they need to make better pricing decisions, and marketing teams can create more effective and better targeted campaigns at significantly lower costs,\" says Andy. \"As a result, the transition to a data-driven company allows us to be more flexible and strategic in our decision-making and operations.\u201d"

        "company": "Hitachi Japan",
        "content": "At Hitachi in recent years, the Digital Systems & Services Headquarters that has jurisdiction over the financial business unit, social business unit, and others in the IT sector led so-called \u201cdata democratization\u201d efforts by building an environment in which anyone is free to utilize various types of data. These efforts enabled employees in various departments who are not IT experts to also look up, process, and analyze data independently and use it to create new businesses or reform operations. For this purpose, the Headquarters provides departments with self-service tools and training environments as well as coaching and other support. Yoshiyuki Tagawa is General Manager of the Group IT Strategy Department in the IT Innovation Division of the Digital Systems & Services Headquarters. He explains the context in which these initiatives began as follows. \u201cCompared to other departments, there are a lot of engineers and other personnel with high IT literacy in the Digital Systems & Services Headquarters, but their interests were mostly directed at customer-oriented operations like development and customer solutions. Therefore, there was generally low interest and literacy with respect to data utilization in workforce management, project management, and other internal operations.\u201d Facing these issues, a particular project prompted Hitachi to begin considering the implementation of data analytics tools. Taiiki Niwa of the Digital Innovation Department reflected as follows. \u201cWe were tasked with assisting sales data analysis for a Group company that handles construction equipment, but being outsiders to that field, we did not know anything about that type of work. Since we first needed BI tools in order to understand the work and the data, we began using Tableau on a provisional basis.\u201d Niwa\u2019s team implemented Tableau in order to perform customer targeting analysis. Utilizing analysis of vast amounts of sales data, they built a mechanism for creating lists of customers with a high likelihood of making purchases so that they could be efficiently targeted for in-person visitation, and this strategy produced huge results. That was one of things that kicked off \u201cdata democratization\u201d in the team. The next thing to boost familiarity with Tableau within the company were the dashboards used to visualize and manage employees\u2019 work status. The Workstyle Reform Law, enacted in April 2019, strengthened the upper limit on overtime and thereby further raised the importance of monitoring work status. Niwa\u2019s team determined that this would be a great opportunity to make Tableau usage commonplace within the company. They created a dashboard that enables anyone to understand at a glance the current state of key work status data that need to be managed, and deployed that dashboard throughout the entire company. Moreover, they also began holding regular hands-on seminars so that users could learn through experience that Tableau enables even people without specialized knowledge and skills to easily visualize various data and put them to use in business. In the year-long period from Tableau\u2019s implementation to October 2019, these efforts grew the number of Tableau Explorer users to around 80 and Tableau Viewer users to around 11,000. In 2022, these numbers grew to around 370 and 21,000 respectively. Niwa explains as follows. \u201cTableau is a tool used in work operations, but one of its most appealing features is that it is also capable of endless variations of graphical visualization that make it fun to use and help you understand how to properly express data. We really get feedback to that effect from users as we help them implement Tableau, and I think that is a major contributor to the spread of usage of the tool in the company.\u201d In the process of selecting a BI tool, the Digital Systems & Services Headquarters apparently researched and conducted hands-on comparisons of every major product on the market. They chose Tableau, and Niwa explains their reasoning as follows. \u201cWe felt that Tableau was superior in many respects, from easily visualizing data to quickly analyzing data from a variety of perspectives and rendering the results as a visualization that anyone can easily understand. Then we actually tried out various BI tools in analyzing the Group company sales data as mentioned before, and once we found that Tableau projects produced the biggest results, we decided to implement Tableau. \u201cMoreso than simply showing the results of data analytics to Group company members, I felt it was far easier to convey information by using Tableau to visualize the data on the spot and show those visualizations right then and there.\u201d That, he said, is why they chose Tableau. Through this process, Hitachi launched the full-fledged implementation of Tableau with the support of Hitachi Solutions, a Tableau reseller partner. By establishing and deploying a Visual Analytics Platform (VAP) centered around Tableau and creating an environment in which individual personnel who are not IT specialists can analyze data and incorporate it into their activities themselves, one example after another emerged from in and around Hitachi of data-empowered improvements to work operations. For example, operational departments themselves used Tableau to create a system for managing and sharing project information and the quality status thereof, a system for providing engineers with data and knowledge, and other such systems. Group companies are also stepping forward to begin using Tableau as a platform for visualizing and sharing data on business performance, projects, human resources, labor affairs, and other matters. \u201cData democratization\u201d aimed to enable all employees to be able to freely make use of data, and this is actually becoming a reality. The impact of Tableau implementation is also clear in the quantitative data. In FY2021, the Workforce Management Dashboard was accessed around 110,000 times throughout the year, which works out to 18,000 hours saved on workforce management. Niwa adds the following comment with respect to these results. \u201cAlthough the reduction in man-hours spent on workforce management is important, even more important is reducing the number of personnel working long hours. We believe the biggest outcome of all to be the fact that we managed to reduce the number of personnel working long hours by around 96% compared to FY2018, before Tableau was implemented. At present, we are working to further expand Tableau usage by deploying dashboards that enable users to instantly see the work status of each employee and detect concentrations of overtime.\u201d By implementing Tableau and creating an environment in which anyone is able to utilize data, Hitachi in steadily pushing ahead the cause of \u201cdata democratization.\u201d Tagawa describes future deployments that will further accelerate Tableau usage as follows. \u201cThe role of the Digital Systems & Services Headquarters is to boost earnings and company growth through data utilization, so we next want to focus on sales and marketing, which are currently white space for us. We expect that Tableau will be an extremely powerful tool in our arsenal during those initiatives because of its ability to easily link up with various other tools and APIs. As it is a tool that benefits even our customers, we want to spread Tableau usage beyond just the Digital Systems & Services Headquarters and even Hitachi to include the entire Group.\u201d"

        "content": "Unacademy, India\u2019s largest online learning platform (Source: The Indian Edtech Story: Q1 2022 Round-up by Markelytics), aims to democratize education. The company makes learning fun and easy with live and recorded classes from the country's best educators and products and services such as test preparation and one-on-one mentorships.  Since its establishment in 2015, Unacademy has achieved phenomenal growth and now has more than 90,000 registered educators and over 92 million users. Tableau helps to inform the company\u2019s strategy to grow even further and maintain its advantage in the highly competitive edtech space. Tableau has also made business intelligence more scalable and is now used daily by more than 1,300 employees to make sense of their data and optimize performance. Unacademy previously managed reporting and analysis with spreadsheets. However, this became unsustainable as the company grew and began to generate vast amounts of data. Needing a robust business intelligence tool, Unacademy evaluated multiple options before selecting Tableau. In addition to its capacity to handle large volumes of data, Tableau met the company\u2019s requirement for a solution that was easy to deploy and use. The ability to automate and schedule data refreshes in Tableau also meant data could be kept up to date with minimal support from the engineering team. Unacademy implemented Tableau Online in 2017, bringing together a number of data sources to establish a single source truth for all learner and educator behavior as well as activities such as sales and marketing. The analytics team created a number of visualizations to start with and provided access to a limited number of users. Since then, adoption has scaled to include nearly all departments and almost 25% of the company\u2019s workforce. Supported by regular training and resources like an internal wiki, employees have also been empowered to analyze data on their own. Unacademy has now successfully democratized data, enabling employees at all levels to make data-driven decisions in near real-time.   The product team is one of several using Tableau to understand and optimize performance. For example, the team has dashboards to track the adoption of products by different types of users. They can drill down to identify which features are most popular and which need refining. They can also identify and prioritize opportunities to improve the user experience.  Manindra Mohan, Senior Vice President of Analytics, shared that the speed to insight provided by Tableau is especially important following the launch of new products.  \u201cAs soon as we launch any new product or initiative, everyone is impatient for the data. If we introduce a new test preparation category, for example, product and marketing teams want to understand adoption across regions and know what\u2019s working or what\u2019s not in respect to product features or marketing campaigns,\u201d said Manindra.  Marketing uses Tableau more broadly to analyze the effectiveness of various channels and identify which drive the most acquisition and conversion. The team can then use these insights to optimize returns from their marketing spend.  Marketing also reduced reporting time from weeks to hours with a new Marketing Performance Tracker that gives the CEO\u2019s office visibility of performance. The team achieved a savings of 30+ hours or the equivalent of 80% reduction in turn-around-time. Other key dashboards help Unacademy to maintain its high standards and deliver high quality education. For example, there are dashboards to track and rank the performance of classes and another to ensure educators receive timely payment. These things combine to help Unacademy incentivize educators and retain the top talent.  The analytics team has leveraged the integration of Tableau and Slack to automate the flow of data and deliver insights straight to the hands of employees. The company now has nearly 100 channels in Slack with different slices of data that are refreshed as often as every 15 minutes. This is especially convenient for senior executives and means they always have access to the latest performance data, including actual and projected revenue. In the future, the analytics team expects data analytics to become even easier for employees. For example, advances in natural language processing will make it possible to access personalized insights quickly without the help of a data analyst.  \u201cWe feel confident that data analytics will continue to gain momentum and will be at the core of technological and business execution,\u201d said Manindra. \u201cTableau, with its scale and penchant for innovation, will play a big role and serve as a medium to make sense of increasingly complex data, build holistic views of company performance, and ensure data consistency and security.\u201d"

It aspires to be the trusted health partner for all Indians and make healthcare more accessible, understandable, and affordable. To deliver on its mission, TATA 1mg provides several services, including e-pharmacy, diagnostics, and e-consultation services. The company also offers an extensive library of health content. TATA 1mg has used Tableau almost since its inception to integrate and visualize data from multiple sources, making analytics more accessible to a growing number of employees. Results from the company\u2019s data journey includes up to 3 times faster reporting, more than 50% improvement in operational cost efficiency, and a more than 25% reduction in order cancellations.   Before partnering with Tableau, TATA 1mg\u2019s analytics reporting cycle was slow and manual. It took nearly four hours of effort to gather and analyze data and share the results with stakeholders. The company wanted a solution that could quickly process large volumes of data and automate reporting. Tableau was chosen for its scalability and its features like scheduled data refreshes. \u201cWe have a large database of transactional and clickstream information that helps us understand and serve our customers better. What we do as a team is filter out the noise from the data and provide the business with the information needed to make decisions,\u201d said Nikhil Doegar, Vice President \u2013 Business Intelligence at TATA 1mg. \u201cThe challenge we\u2019ve solved with Tableau is making that information available to everyone at a click of a button, even as we continue to scale.\u201d TATA 1mg implemented Tableau Server and Tableau Desktop in 2016 and has since integrated data from multiple sources to track and report on everything from sales trends to supply chain operations. This has included leveraging Tableau\u2019s native integration with Amazon Redshift and Snowflake. The integration with Redshift enables TATA 1mg to analyze transactional data on a real-time basis, enabling it to better track the customer journey and identify potential fraud. Goldstone Technologies Limited, a business intelligence, and IT services company, has supported TATA 1mg\u2019s data journey by helping to manage Tableau and related business systems. This has not only minimized downtime, but freed up developers to focus more of their time on creating dashboards. \u201cYou need partners you can depend on to keep things running smoothly and ensure your business is not impacted when things go wrong. Goldstone provides that reliability,\u201d said Nikhil. Data-driven decision-making has been part of TATA 1mg\u2019s ethos from the beginning. Tableau has helped scale this data culture by equipping teams with a shared platform for data analytics. Teams can track and collaborate around shared metrics, and they speak a common language when it comes to data analytics. \u201cHaving common dashboards to support our decision-making helps with collaboration and I believe that alignment between teams is reflected in our results,\u201d said Doegar.  Starting out with a handful of Tableau licenses for its analytics team, the company now has 200 viewer licenses,70 explorer licenses, and seven creator licenses. It also has plans to grow its user base by approximately 50% year on year.  Users come from across the business and include developers responsible for creating dashboards as well as mid-to-senior level management in areas like sales, procurement, supply chain and human resources. For business users, TATA 1mg runs regular training sessions on Tableau and emphasizes the importance of using data to drive performance. These include monthly orientation and training sessions known as \u2018happy hours\u2019 where new employees and existing users can learn about new features and product highlights.  There\u2019s also an internal group known as \u2018Tableau users\u2019 who help to support their colleagues by answering Tableau related questions and sharing new information. In the future, they plan to create a repository of internal use cases, answers to frequently asked questions, and other resources to promote best practice and save users time.    Data analytics at TATA 1mg is now evolving towards self-service. Teams have access to dashboards that are refreshed on a regular basis, and they can use the filters provided to drill down into the data and uncover new insights. This has significantly increased reporting efficiency while making it easier for teams to monitor their key performance indicators (KPIs). Benefits provided by Tableau include a greater understanding of customers and how to optimize customer acquisition costs. For example, TATA 1mg growth teams can monitor their new customer acquisition trends by marketing channel through Tableau dashboards, which helps them optimize their marketing spends for a better ROI.  \u201cAs you invest in digital channels, you need immediate access to data to measure the return. Then, if a campaign isn\u2019t working, you can improve it or turn it off right away, rather than spending money on something that will not deliver the desired results,\u201d said Nikhil. Supply chain management is another area of the business that\u2019s benefited. Through the availability of fast, accurate data, TATA 1mg is able to ensure the right products are available in the right quantity in each location. Nikhil shared that the pandemic accentuated the importance of having readily available information to manage customer demand and turnaround times. \u201cThe need for medication, consultations, and testing became critical during the pandemic. If our team did not have access to real-time information, these things would have taken longer to provide,\u201d he said. The next step in TATA 1mg\u2019s data journey is to enable true self-service where datasets are made available to employees, and they can create their own dashboards by dragging and dropping in different fields and filters. This will ultimately help the company democratize data. \u201cDashboards are important, but I don\u2019t think that should be the limit of what\u2019s made available to employees. Instead, they should have access to the source and be able to explore the data on their own. That\u2019s where we are headed and Tableau will help make it possible,\u201d said Nikhil.

        "content": "This story was produced by our partner, Visualitics. The original version in Italian can be found here. Prometeia is one of the leading European consulting firms in Risk and Wealth Management solutions and services for institutional investors. With offices in Bologna, Milan, Rome and five international branches (London, Istanbul, Zurich, Moscow, Cairo), it boasts over 1000 professionals active worldwide. In 2016, the company adopted Tableau with the main purpose of developing a portal dedicated to numerous customers. \"We needed to create a virtual place where they could interact with the territorial and sectoral forecast analyses that we made available to them, in various economic and financial sectors\" says Marco Brandolini, Principal of the Wealth & Asset Management area and head of the Business Intelligence and Customer Analytics. \"Thus, thanks to the use of Tableau, the Prometeia Mio portal was born: a platform that the customer can access to view the data of their interest, compose customized dashboards and automatically and autonomously download the necessary information; and thus, starting from that successful experience, various projects were born aimed at creating data warehouses and reporting / BI systems in the environments of some of the main players in the Banking and Real Estate world. In recent years, the use of Tableau is also accelerating the creation of embedded analytics for SaaS applications such as ESG/Physical Risk analysis.\u201d To date, in the group of analysts and experts in Data&Analytics in the Wealth & Asset Management area of Prometeia, more than 30 people have introduced Tableau as a working tool. \"It was essential for us to find a method of analysis that included, as the last step of the process, a captivating way of presenting the results achieved.\" Brandolini explains that thanks to data visualization he has solved the problem. \u201cAt times, we had difficulty in making the final result of our analyses appreciated in its entirety, which ran the risk of getting lost behind the narrative of mechanisms that are not always easily understood. We have found in Tableau a flexible, powerful and versatile tool that has allowed us to give further value to our calculations also as regards \u201chistorical\u201d and mature services that we make available to our customers, such as territorial financial analyses and forecasts; so the customer can really touch, in an immediate and above all interactive way, the results of our analysis algorithms, which are usually very complex, favoring the 'dialogue' between back-end and front-end.\" Tableau has also provided an enormous contribution in the internal development processes: in fact, with the use of Tableau, on the one hand, the realization times have been reduced by 20%, especially in the prototyping phases of the most innovative solutions and on the other hand it has allowed to professionals less accustomed to programming to actively contribute to their design and development. Prometeia worked with Tableau partner, Visualitics, to implement Tableau. \"In the process of disseminating skills on Tableau, Visualitics he played the fundamental role of accelerator and facilitator: if before our modus operandi included numerous solo tests on the tool, with their support the training has become very specific on numerous projects and aspects\" , Brandolini points out, who made use of both Basic and Advanced courses, and various on-the-job training within his own group: \"Surely the help of a specialized partner facilitated the learning curve of the tool and made it possible to fully exploit its enormous potential. \""

        "company": "MicroPort CRM",
        "content": "Global medical devices company, MicroPort CRM, is on a mission to prolong and improve the lives of patients everywhere. It believes in mastering the small details to achieve big things, and that means close collaboration with the medical community, seamless operations across international markets, and designing innovative solutions across multiple fields, such as orthopaedics, cardiovascular health, electro-physiology, and vascular intervention. We spoke to IT Project Leader, Anne-Claude Barbary about MicroPort CRM's Tableau rollout and the early users who\u2019ve become avid Tableau fans. Competition in the healthcare industry is fierce. Today, being able to benefit from the most precise indicators in real-time makes it possible to be reactive and to anticipate market trends. In a current context, with its share of uncertainty, benefiting from a powerful data visualization and analytics tool is a differentiating criterion in the market. We were using several tools including spreadsheets and a business intelligence solution to perform data analysis, but we lacked a central platform to bring that information together and drill down into our business pain points at different levels. While we could manually consolidate most of our data, it didn\u2019t give us a complete picture and key information was missing. Users were also complaining that the existing tool was complex to use and had limited visualisation capabilities. If they ran a query they\u2019d have to manually extract and massage the data, which was tedious and prone to human error. We chose Tableau to support a core data modelling project with the aim of consolidating and gathering enterprise-wide information into a central repository. We rolled it out to a few nominated stakeholders in other departments to help them fluidly visualise and explore company data and share those insights with their team. Tableau connects with a wide range of data sources, including databases, servers, data sheets, and cloud applications. Because data is stored securely in the cloud and accessible via a single web interface, it\u2019s much easier to give users access to data anywhere and from any device, and we didn\u2019t need any specific hardware or configuration to get started. We\u2019re really happy with Tableau, it\u2019s between 10-100 times faster than other solutions on the market, and you can sort, highlight, drill down, or filter data from a central, user friendly dashboard really quickly and easily. Our champion in the finance department, Guillaume Charles, commented, \u201cTableau will be a great improvement for all stakeholders across the company. It\u2019s accessible anytime, anywhere with both standard and personalised reports. In the finance team we now have total confidence that we\u2019re working with the most accurate figures and it helps us reconcile sales, be it market or regional, more efficiently, so we can drill down into the sales mix, gross margin, and volume of units sold.\u201d Our implementation partner, DXC, was instrumental in providing training for the team and creating dashboards we could use to base future use cases on. We also created a video to educate users on what Tableau can do for them and nominated champions to test the solution and film a short testimonial. We launched a starter pack of reports to help people access the information that\u2019s interesting and relevant for them, and taught users how to adapt and modify these reports or create new dashboards to empower each department to be more independent. This was a big shift in how we managed data at MicroPort CRM, so we\u2019re making sure the communication lines are open and that we\u2019ve been proactive about making the IT team available to support people who are less confident with technology. Built in features such as the ability to adapt existing dashboards are really powerful to help us stay agile and uncover new perspectives from existing data. You can change the geography, add extra data, or calculate new ratios to keep querying the data until you\u2019ve found the information you\u2019re looking for. Then you can create a new dashboard with the relevant data to share with the rest of the team, using permissions to control who has access. Tableau has a visual richness, including more than 20 graphical forms and customisable reports, but because of its live connection to our data source it will always display the most up to date and reliable information. A great example of how Tableau supports collaboration with data across departments was highlighted by our Manufacturing Controlling Director, Stephane Oules, who uses Tableau to automate reports on SAP inventories, which saves a lot of time every month and has eliminated manual errors. He\u2019s also created an inventories dashboard in collaboration with the supply chain and finance teams. \u201cThe inventory report is used to calculate inventory reserves so we have a sensible point of calculation to enter inventory reserve compliance for each legal entity and the dashboard gives us a unique, controlled, and reconciled database to track inventory per geographical area on a weekly or monthly basis. These dashboards allow anyone to drill down per product category, location type, or by expiration risk, and by improving inventory management we can reduce the amount of stock we have to scrap because it\u2019s past its expiration date.\u201d A great example of the impact of Tableau was reported by our Global Product Manager for Leads, Bastienne Cabestan. She explained, \u201cTo track the sale of leads \u2013 that is, the cables used to connect devices \u2013 we have to evaluate the lead to port radio, which is the number of ports on MicroPort devices that are connected to MicroPort leads as opposed to cables from another brand. Our goal is to reach 100% lead to port ratio, which would mean all of our devices are connected with MicroPort leads. Thanks to Tableau, we\u2019ve created an interactive dashboard to report on lead sales and support ratios, which can be tailored to specific products.\u201d For example, the team is tracking the adoption of the Vega lead, which works with MicroPort CRM pacemakers, and thanks to the user-friendly dashboards it can easily share insights with the sales operations and country marketing teams, who don\u2019t have a deep understanding of tech. This in turn will give those teams insights into opportunities to sell more Vega leads to customers who have purchased pacemakers, so we\u2019re already seeing how Tableau can help the whole business to be more efficient and make smarter decisions based on real data."

        "company": "Rail Delivery Group ",
        "content": "Every train journey involves multiple touchpoints. And every touchpoint is a source of data that can be harnessed to improve the passenger experience. Rail Delivery Group (RDG) plays a key role in capturing and collating data about customers\u2019 journeys \u2013 both physical and digital. Here Toby Ayre, Head of Data and Analytics for RDG, explains how Tableau Cloud unlocks insights across millions of different train products and routes. From Railcard renewal rates to smart ticket volumes, these insights enable RDG and train operating companies to make faster and smarter decisions that enrich the customer experience for millions of passengers. Data helps everyone involved in delivering rail services better understand their customers, so they can provide richer experiences. RDG brings together the 28 train operating companies that run Britain\u2019s railways, and that means we need to bring together different datasets too. This is both a challenge and an opportunity \u2013 the country\u2019s rail network is incredibly complex with multiple platforms and providers supporting customers\u2019 physical and digital journeys.  Every digital touchpoint provides us with a data touchpoint. From reserving a seat online to validating a ticket in the station \u2013 we can now capture insights before, during, and after a customer\u2019s journey. We\u2019ve already amassed hundreds of billions of records in our data warehouse, and this is constantly expanding as passengers increasingly use mobile and electronic tickets. But it\u2019s not just about data quantity; it\u2019s data quality that really matters. Evaluating data from a single source can only take you so far; you need to be able to look at the customer experience across different channels and touchpoints to drive continuous improvement. With Tableau, we can visualise data from more than 35 different systems, including Salesforce, to provide train operating companies and RDG colleagues with richer insights.  We have built around 900 dashboards which are used by more than 300 people from 35 different organisations. The dashboards enable stakeholders to visualise commercial, financial, and operational data quickly and easily, which means they can make smarter decisions to achieve better results. For example, we\u2019ve built a dashboard that tracks customer response rates to Railcard email communications, which are co-ordinated via Salesforce\u2019s Marketing Cloud. The team uses these insights to identify opportunities to boost engagement which has resulted in improved personalisation and more relevant content across our journeys. With MuleSoft, Salesforce\u2019s integration platform, we can connect Railcard purchases in Salesforce\u2019s Service Cloud with campaign records in Marketing Cloud. This enables us to link revenue generation to individual emails and gain a unique insight into customer behaviours. Tableau has also been instrumental in accelerating the roll-out of digital experiences on Britain\u2019s railways by providing train operating companies with visibility of the utilisation of smart tickets, which are now available on nine out of ten routes. It\u2019s amazing what can be achieved in a short period of time. As well as simplifying the aggregation of different data sources, we\u2019ve been able to reduce the time spent developing reports. With Tableau, we can provide self-service access to live commercial data with filters across millions of different products and routes, which means our people can focus on progressing strategic projects instead of manipulating spreadsheets. If a train operating company wants to visualise a new dataset, we can build a dashboard quickly and easily. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it took just two days to design and deploy a Tableau dashboard to help train operating companies monitor face mask utilisation during national lockdowns. We want to keep evolving our data maturity, focusing more on predicting the future than evaluating the past, to drive greater efficiency gains and enable richer customer experiences. By continuing to expand the data captured in Salesforce and the source systems that feed into Tableau, we will be able to share more insights with more stakeholders. We want to empower more people with personalised visualisation tools and analytics so they can harness the full value of data. With Tableau, we can unlock the insights needed to help shape the future of Britain\u2019s railways. "

        "company": "Online PSB Loans",
        "content": "Online PSB Loans Limited is India's largest lending fintech. The company\u2019s marketplace platform, \u2018PSB Loans in 59 Minutes\u2019, automates and digitizes the lending process, making it easier for both borrowers and lenders. Founded in 2015, Online PSB Loans now has 95% of the country\u2019s commercial banks on its platform and helps them to streamline approvals for several loan types, including business loans for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and retail loans. \u201cIt is a win-win for banks and borrowers as borrowers can see all of the available loan products on our platform and identify the one most suited to meet their requirements,\u201d said Paresh Ashara, President of Analytics. \u201cOnce they receive in-principle approval for the loan, the rest of the process is easy and can be completed faster.\u201d As part of its offering, Online PSB Loans provides banks with insights to help them manage their lending activities. Powered by Tableau embedded analytics, these insights include metrics such as number of applications vs disbursements as well as competitor analysis. Paresh, who is responsible for all analytics and insight initiatives at Online PSB Loans, shared why the company had chosen Tableau embedded analytics to support its data strategy. Online PSB Loans enables banks to facilitate loans through its marketplace and also offers a white label solution that banks can use to facilitate loans through their own portal or in-branch. The company has always provided reporting to customers to support these offerings. It started with insights provided in the form of a PDF, but it was soon evident customers wanted more data points. Tableau embedded analytics made it possible to not only provide customers with more data, but to allow them to interact with dashboards and self-serve. Paresh said that choosing an embedded analytics solution rather than building out its own helped the company to speed time to market. Online PSB Loans went live with the solution just two to three months after finalizing its data strategy. \u201cIf we were to custom build an analytics solution there are a number of features and capabilities we would need to develop from the ground up in order to manage the data sets and perform calculations and statistical analysis. Tableau has all of these capabilities built in. It also provides us with flexibility in how we present our data and at the end of the day that's what really matters to our customers,\u201d said Paresh. The analytics team initially prepared three to four different dashboards to help banks track specific metrics. It has since expanded on these and created nearly thirty dashboards that provide banks with a more holistic view of their performance. For example, they can analyse performance of different loan products by volume and value and identify their top products. They can also easily view and compare performance across different time periods. With the majority of the country\u2019s commercial banks on its platform, Online PSB Loans has a wealth of industry data. The analytics team uses Tableau to analyse and share this information with banks as well. The market intelligence includes the ranking of banks in each product category and more granular insights such as the average time from application to approval and from approval to disbursement. Equipped with all these insights, banks can make better decisions to improve their overall performance and the take up of loans. Data analytics has become a core part of Online PSB Loan\u2019s offering and the banks have appreciated the ability to consume data on their own using the Tableau dashboards. At the same time, they continually seek more insights to help them manage their business. The analytics team has responded by preparing quarterly and annual reports with detailed commentary. The team has traditionally completed the analysis for the reports using Tableau before downloading dashboards and adding commentary offline. However, they will soon add commentary into Tableau dashboards directly. This will reduce the time spent preparing reports and enable banks to access the insights much faster. Online PSB Loans is continuing to add value to banks and contributing to the country\u2019s overall financial sector with solutions like a new portal where businesses and individuals can access loans subsidized by the government. The Tableau embedded analytics solution will form part of this offering in the future."

        "company": "Egged Transportation ",
        "content": "This article was created by our partner, G-Stat. It originally appeared here.  Egged Transportation Ltd. is one of the world\u2019s largest private public transportation companies, with operations serving over 1M daily passengers in Israel, the Netherlands and Poland. Egged is Israel\u2019s largest public transportations operator, operating 48% of the country\u2019s public transportation lines, with over 8,500 employees and an estimated annual revenue of $1.2B. Within  the transportation sector, Egged is a market leader and an innovator in a number of fields from Public Transit and Vehicle Maintenance to the operation of Tel Aviv\u2019s first Lightrail train, pioneering Mobility as a Service (MaaS) in several cities throughout Israel and industry-leading R&D. We spoke with Yoni Polakowsky, Head of BI and Analytics at Egged about the company's journey to becoming a data-driven organisation.  First, it\u2019s critical to point out that Egged was gold in terms of the volume and quality of data accumulated over the years. Data sources included core systems of traffic planning and management, meta-management systems, and tens of thousands of IoT devices. As a result, departments presented processed information in Excel that took a long time to produce, and each manager presented the data according to his organizational truth. Information was not easily accessible, there was virtually no integration and therefore our ability to analyze data was quite limited.  I arrived at Egged a year ago, shortly after a new BI system was implemented \u2013 Tableau. The company\u2019s CIO, Nina Gispan, chose Tableau as the tool for analytics and organizational inquiry after extensive examination of other leading products on the market. Tableau was chosen mainly due to a need for rapid implementation; it\u2019s an intuitive, user-friendly tool with a high level of visualization making it ideal for large-scale operationalization across a large enterprise such as Egged. It was also critical to choose a tool with advanced analytics capabilities and integration with a large variety of databases. My first task was to transform years of data accumulated across many disparate systems and turn it into meaningful knowledge we could use to make business decisions \u2013 with the help of Tableau. The ambition was to empower Egged\u2019s senior management and mid-level management with the ability to make better, data-based decisions to propel the company forward and optimize operational performance. Tableau Implementation partner 'G-Stat' played a key role in helping us by assisting to transform and run our businesses simply. The system went live about 2 years ago, when the implementation process included Consult by G-Stat experts and ongoing support to this day, which provides a full professional umbrella for solving and implementing Best Practices. Our highest goal continues to be transforming Egged into a data-driven organization. That is, the creation of a unified ecosystem in which all business units speak the same language and reflect the same organizational truth \u2013 to enhance our ability to make bigger, better decisions. Proper data processing and accessibility can and should be a key tool for continuous improvement, across the organization. We needed a centralized, integrated tool and we knew this would require collaboration across our Technology and Business units.  Today, 18 months since the system went live, it is used across the organization horizontally and vertically, across every business unit and level of management. First, it\u2019s become a tool to reflect business activity and project management. It is used to make data-based managerial decisions both at a project level, and in day-to-day business activities. In addition, Tableau is used by analysts to identify anomalies and opportunities for business improvement. Egged operates a vehicle maintenance system which includes hundreds of employees and a large array of garages across a wide geographic area. We consider the maintenance system a major growth engine, so we needed a research tool to continuously identify profitability opportunities.  To fulfill this need, we created an integrated interrogation model in Tableau that allows for profitability analysis at all levels of the various garages, down to the employee level, work cell and even on an hourly level. Using an advanced model like this and with clear goal setting, Enables management decisions based on very accurate information to allow for operational efficiency. We wanted to give all of our business units access to the data we had collected, quickly and easily. We set up a responsive BI portal with access to all reports, which is also available on mobile through the Tableau app. It is used by employees and managers who are outside the office, at work sites, in meetings, and working from home \u2013 allowing them access by mobile and tablet, depending on their work and device preference. To make this happen, we took a systems-thinking approach, designing the necessary infrastructure both from a communication as well as security standpoint (we use OKTA). Since many Egged employees work outside the office, this effort helped solve long-standing issues of access to information. Overall, the project marks a significant milestone on our strategic roadmap toward becoming a data-driven organization."

        "company": "ILIAS Solutions",
        "content": "ILIAS delivers a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software suite that lets defence organisations around the world adopt a fully data-driven command approach. Its flagship Defence Platform covers the entire armed forces value chain, aligning operation and training data with maintenance, supply, and procurement. The resulting 360o view helps ensure effective execution of processes and efficient management of defence capabilities, all within allocated budgets. ILIAS uses Tableau embedded analytics to put critical insights directly at its customers\u2019 fingertips, providing an end-to-end data \u2018cockpit\u2019 that can be used to optimise every aspect of operations. Tableau\u2019s extensive functionality, rich visuals and ease-of-use all serve as key differentiators for ILIAS, allowing it to support organisations with a consistent and long-term data approach. As part of its own data journey, ILIAS has also utilised Tableau Blueprint to validate key learnings along the way, help customers embrace self-service analytics, and expand its platform with a range of new data-driven services and offerings. ILIAS first approached Tableau in 2019, during a challenging moment in the company\u2019s history. \u201cThe original data platform that ILIAS built its solution on went in another strategic direction and we were unable to continue with them,\u201d explains Niek Freriks, Product Owner at ILIAS. \u201cIn short, we had just months to complete a full migration to an entirely new data platform, or risk major interruption to our services.\u201d With no time to waste, ILIAS consulted the 2019 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms and began contacting all organisations in the \u2018leaders\u2019 quadrant. \u201cWe spoke with a wide range of vendors,\u201d continues Niek. \u201cHowever, the one that truly stood out was Tableau. Not only was the analytics platform incredibly visual and easy to use, but everyone we spoke to from Tableau was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and importantly, sympathetic to our situation. After our experiences, we felt very strongly that we wanted to have a great relationship with our new provider and to be treated well. With Tableau, it just felt right from very beginning.\u201d Tableau\u2019s partners were also extremely helpful to ILIAS throughout the migration period, assisting with training and education sessions to get the team quickly up to speed, something that became particularly difficult once the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in early 2020. \u201cTableau and its partners really rallied round us, making sure we had all the tools and knowledge we needed to successfully complete the migration, despite such a tight timeline,\u201d says Niek. \u201cPrior to the pandemic, Tableau reseller Biztory delivered an intensive training session at our offices. Then, when face-to-face sessions became impossible, everyone worked really hard, up to 60 hours a week, to finish the migration remotely. It was intense, but it was also incredibly rewarding when we achieved it. With Tableau in place, ILIAS can now deliver powerful, customised data analytics to every customer as part of its Defence Platform. \u201cAll of our customers have their own data preferences and needs, meaning their analytics has to be fully customisable,\u201d explains Niek. \u201cThis ranges from the visual appearance of each organisation\u2019s platform view to the range of dashboards they see upon logging in.\u201d \u201cUsing Tableau embedded analytics, we can provide each customer with a tailored view that enables them to quickly see what the next best action is for them,\u201d continues Niek. \u201cThat level of scalability and capability was something that couldn\u2019t be done with our previous analytics platform, but Tableau makes it incredibly easy to achieve. What\u2019s more, because Tableau is embedded, they don\u2019t even realise they\u2019re using it. It\u2019s simply part of the ILIAS Defence platform.\u201d As part of its ongoing data journey, ILIAS recently used Tableau Blueprint to assess both its own data usage, and that of its customers, yielding a wide range of positive outcomes. \u201cTableau Blueprint is a step-by-step guide to becoming more data-driven and its really helped us to validate a lot of our key learnings over the last two years,\u201d says Niek. \u201cIt\u2019s also taught us to embrace self-service analytics much more, which is something we\u2019re now actively working with our customers on as well.\u201d The result is much greater democratisation of data, which is not only driving better adoption amongst customers but also helping to foster powerful data cultures from within, where data is accessible to all. \u201cWhile our customers get a lot of insight analysing their data through our standard embedded dashboards, there\u2019s so much more they can learn from their data when they have the right tools and knowledge in place,\u201d says Niek. \u201cRealising this, we recently began to offer an open data source to our customers that they can use in conjunction with tools like Tableau\u2019s Ask Data to answer their own questions, whenever they need to. This greater accessibility is really helping to maximise Tableau\u2019s potential within their organisations, leading to a wealth of valuable new data insights being uncovered.\u201d In addition to these powerful business benefits, Tableau visualisation is a real eye catcher and differentiator in the defence market. \u201cData was, is, and always will be, at the very core of our business. Tableau brings raw data to life in such a visual way that it really sells our solution to new customers and prospects,\u201d concludes Niek. \u201cTableau also helps us to show the value of the underlying Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in our Defence Platform, which is incredibly powerful. Simply put, visual is best!\u201d"

        "company": "RBC Wealth Management",
        "content": "RBC Wealth Management\u2014U.S. helps individuals and families achieve their financial needs, wants, and wishes with advice and wealth management solutions. The firm embarked on an unusual digital transformation, putting data at the center of its strategy, and delivering a purpose-built experience that maximizes analytics and insights for its employees and clients. Headquartered in Minneapolis, the firm has two organizations: The Private Client Group, with more than 2,100 advisors in 42 states, and Clearing & Custody Services, with 300 independent broker dealers nationwide. While the company consistently received high industry ratings for its culture and service, its technology rankings were lagging. They were even losing potential advisors because of it. \u201cIt was a clear sign we needed to do something. Technology is one thing you can control. If you have the money, the time, and the brain power, it\u2019s something you can and should improve,\u201d said Greg Beltzer head of technology for RBC Wealth Management\u2014U.S. This insight became a catalyst for their digital transformation. \u201cWe wanted to have everything in place that our advisors, our independent broker dealers, and their clients need to manage their finances,\u201d Beltzer said. \u201cWe wanted them to be more efficient and make technology as frictionless as possible for the end user.\u201d But it was no small undertaking. Like most financial services companies, their technology stack was a mix of legacy and new systems and applications across business, operational, and compliance groups, along with strict regulations and oversight requirements.  That\u2019s when the division went in an innovative direction: instead of keeping technology across all its teams, they moved it under one group, with Beltzer leading the charge. Transforming to this unique model, they removed the data silos across teams and could deliver a consistent, real-time user experience for everyone across products, services, and functions to access the same customer records and empower them with data analytics and actionable insights. Beltzer pointed out that senior executive buy-in was critical to embark this ambitious data transformation journey. \u201cHelping our leadership understand the importance of curating and managing this data for the greater good, you\u2019ve got to have executive alignment or you're going to go uphill all the way.\u201d Beltzer then worked with his team to develop the tech stack, putting fintechs like Informatica and Docupace at the forefront of strategy. With Salesforce Financial Services Cloud as the CRM foundation, embedded dashboards from CRM Analytics (formerly Tableau CRM) were layered on top to surface AI-driven insights to the advisors in the context of their existing CRM workflow. The team also used other Salesforce technologies like MuleSoft and Slack to help drive the business forward in its digital transformation. Salesforce\u2019s built-in connectors enabled them to tie together the end-user experience, bridging data gaps between legacy systems and multiple platforms, from more than 26 data sources and creating 270 CRM Analytics data flows. Beltzer said that building a data pipeline into Salesforce and CRM Analytics with just a few clicks was a huge time saver. The technology team could then focus on building the dashboard, creating a better experience and more opportunities for actionable insights. With a 360\u00b0 view of its customers and a single source of truth, all groups across RBC Wealth Management\u2014U.S. could view the same record, whether they're doing trades, servicing an account, ensuring regulatory compliance, and more. As Beltzer put it, \u201cThat\u2019s what allowed us to change the game. We had real-time insights that could empower anyone, anywhere in their organization, and to help their customers like they never had before,\u201d Beltzer said. With updated client records and analytics, it was easier than ever for advisors to take action on that data. \u201cWe made it super seamless to make those insights actionable for their clients in that moment,\u201d Beltzer pointed out. Advisors, for example, could have a discussion with a client and then trigger a marketing campaign from the dashboard based on the Einstein Next Best Action, or use a roll up analytics dashboards for a broader view of the overall market the next minute. Real-time data and analytics were also invaluable if a client called unexpectedly. Advisors would have up-to-date balances and could surface actionable insights to make suggestions for clients, like setting up online access or adding another beneficiary to an IRA. Beltzer said, \u201cWe made insights contextual and personalized so they can take action, and that's where both the advisor and client win.\u201d One of the most popular and useful dashboards among advisors turned out to be a last-minute addition: a client\u2019s financial services life events. Advisors could view client birthdays, anniversaries, and other life milestones. \u201cIt\u2019s a great example of how data can empower a user in ways that you can't predict,\u201d Beltzer said. He added that it\u2019s also why user feedback is critical when evaluating current and future data analytics functionality. For managing compliance and regulatory requirements, the company is starting to use Tableau\u2019s AI capabilities to uncover potential fraudulent trends, unusual money movement activities, and other activities that can raise red flags and mitigate risks.  RBC Wealth Management\u2014U.S. doesn\u2019t have an end date for digital transformation. Beltzer\u2019s team is planning the next stages of Salesforce and CRM Analytics\u2014from expanding functionality to new integrations, and increased automations. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about a lot of ideas on how to make the client experience more seamless, how to make staff more efficient, and remove manual procedures we have today,\u201d Beltzer said. He added, \u201cWe\u2019ve had some early wins and it\u2019s really helpful momentum, but we\u2019ve set expectations that this is a journey we're going to continue and rise to that challenge. It's fun when you're able to solve something that took someone an hour to put together and produce it within seconds or minutes. It's a pretty cool feeling.\u201d"

        "content": "Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a leading science and technology company, is dedicated to advancing global scientific progress across the areas of Life Science, Healthcare, and Electronics. By combining a passion for science and technology, with the natural curiosity of its 60,300 employees, the company\u2019s products, services, and platforms make research simpler, more exact, and help deliver breakthroughs more quickly.  The Life Science business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, works to accelerate access to health for people everywhere by impacting life and health with science. To accelerate its customers\u2019 journey to deliver life-saving therapeutics and uncover new opportunities, a single data visualization platform was needed for business insights. Tableau was selected in June 2019 as the tool of choice for the Life Science business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Two years later, a global company-wide project was launched to leverage Tableau for data storytelling.  Today, more than 5,000 colleagues leverage Tableau for daily data-driven business decisions. We spoke to Carsten Goepp, Life Science Analytics Centre of Excellence (ACE) Data Architecture & Data Engineer Lead (also known as Dr. Tableau within the data and analytics community), about how Tableau helps drive customer impact and business value, the Tableau community, and what this journey means for his colleagues.    The business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany has more than 60,000 employees working across 66 countries to find solutions to some of today\u2019s toughest challenges. Every part of the business needs accessible data and actionable insights to deliver the best service to our customers. Tableau was selected as the best tool for the job. Each business unit rolled out their own instance, resulting in 11 independent Tableau environments. While Tableau is great and our teams were already creating business value, multiple instances created silos. This risked introducing inconsistencies. In 2020, in collaboration with the company\u2019s IT team, we launched a project that led to the establishment of MTableau, a single Tableau platform for Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany and its affiliates. Our vision was to establish a global data community. We want to enable colleagues to quickly find insights to help our customers drive their scientific breakthrough journey. The goal was to define, design, and implement one Tableau solution for all operating models, roles, processes, and architecture. We took a holistic approach to the project implementation -- by aligning with business and IT stakeholders at the foundational stages. Ultimately, MTableau led to the creation of a standard approach that worked for everyone across the entire organisation. First, a centralised data source is critical to a successful Tableau project implementation. Before our Tableau adoption, our team launched a data repository to centralise our data. To date, our repository houses 1.5 petabytes of data (~270 data sets) from our SAP, ERP, CRM, HR, and supply chain systems. This makes it easy for end-users to interact and connect data for seamless visualization.  Our adoption metrics speak for our progress. At the end of 2021, our monthly active users more than doubled \u2013 from 1,000 to over 5,000. Secondly, treat the Tableau implementation as a change in culture, not just as a technology rollout. Use the Tableau Blueprint to learn about best practices. You should also have a clearly defined concept, raise awareness about the project, and engage with stakeholders as early as possible to align on ideas. Finally, when it comes to user adoption, drive a self-serve analytics mindset, bring people together, and establish a spirit of collaboration. From project request, data access, user licenses, dashboard deployments, to access management, our processes are designed for self-service. Self-service analytics goes beyond a \u201cuser does everything\u201d mindset. It is essential to invest in end-user-friendly procedures. This provides flexibility and agility for users at the different stages of their journey. I see this as a great success model as 95% of our Tableau projects are based on a self-service model. Additionally, Tableau is easy to learn which is crucial for an upskilling strategy. Provide a community and learning hub for colleagues to ask questions to learn from each other. For instance, our Tableau Knowledge Hub is a user-friendly portal offering video tutorials, knowledge articles, community forum, and contacts for additional support from the tech team. We now have readily available insights to impact our customers\u2019 journey. To name a few:  Our colleagues have truly embraced the data and analytics transformation journey. One member of the leadership team shared this feedback when they started using Tableau: \u201cI am awed about the analytics we can get out of this. It\u2019s really a new way of looking at our numbers in a dynamic and real-time way. I can see how we can use Tableau in the future to deliver business insights in real-time.\u201d It is amazing to see the level of enthusiasm and engagement around knowledge and best practice sharing. Ultimately, Tableau makes data accessible to more colleagues, which means more minds working together to create new innovative solutions that have a real impact on people\u2019s lives. Data democratisation gives us a real edge over the competition. I love Tableau. It is easy to access, analyse, and share insights with colleagues. We have a great partnership with the Tableau team which is built on trust. I am also impressed by the speed of Tableau\u2019s innovation, providing new functionalities to help us achieve our data visualisation goals. We are also able to use the Tableau Enterprise Customer Group as a great channel to connect and collaborate with Tableau users. There is a real community spirit among Tableau clients globally. Tableau is open to everyone across Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and its affiliates. Every team has the data available to focus on what they do best \u2013 driving impact. I am really excited to see the opportunities and creativity we can unlock in the future, and how this will help drive our customers\u2019 scientific breakthrough journey."

        "title": "U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee helps Team USA succeed by building a better digital HQ with Tableau and Salesforce",
        "company": "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee",
        "content": "Team USA, the collective name for referring to all national sports teams representing the United States in international competitions, is among the most respected and influential leaders in the world of sports. The brand comprises nearly 100 teams that compete in the Olympic Games, Paralympic Games, and other international competitions including soccer, basketball, hockey, baseball, and golf. Operational support for Team USA comes from U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), founded in 1895 and headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The USOPC's mission is to empower Team USA athletes to achieve sustained competitive excellence and well-being by championing the integrity of sport, and by promoting and protecting athletes\u2019 rights, safety, and wellness. As part of this mission, the committee has put an emphasis in recent years on digitally transforming all areas of its operations. This includes continuously seeking new ways of quickly consolidating, analyzing, and sharing data as efficiently as possible. As part of collaborating with Salesforce, they discovered early on the combined power of Tableau and the Salesforce Customer 360 to provide robust analytics and data visualization at scale, along with powerful governance and privacy controls. The first team to adopt Tableau at USOPC was its international competitive analysis team. \u201cWe had just acquired a comprehensive competition results database, and we were looking for the most efficient and effective way to analyze, visualize, and understand the data,\u201d said Team USA. \u201cMost other tools had visualization capabilities, but we needed a tool that put visualization first.\u201d Harnessing these capabilities in Tableau helped eliminate manual processes and provided key decision makers with dashboard views into data to drive new strategic initiatives. The USOPC currently has around 65 Tableau power users and is partway through an organization-wide rollout of a Customer 360 solution including Sales Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP). Use of Tableau is most prominent in three of the USOPC's business units: logistics, scouting, and training for athletes; marketing performance management; and fundraising. Capabilities like tailoring a single dashboard to multiple individuals' needs make it easy for people to share insights and understand data in new ways relating to their task at hand. For example, the Athlete Scouting dashboard uses quantitative data\u2014such as historical data, data made available by each sport's governing organization, and data ingested from video of a game or match\u2014to evaluate an athlete's performance and assess how they compare with their top competitors. From this dashboard, the USOPC can generate scouting reports and performance plans by identifying areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. \u201cFrom the start, the interactive and intuitive interface Tableau gave us was a game changer, allowing us to consolidate and share our work with little to no effort,\u201d said Team USA. \u201cThe ability for automatically updating reports to reflect real-time data changes also freed up so much time for our small but mighty analyst crew, so they could spend their time on other important initiatives.\u201d Another dashboard helps untangle the many logistics athletes face related to travel and attendance at events, including who's made the team, whether they have current passports and headshots, and what lodging facilities are available for them to stay at after they arrive. During the COVID-era, at the Olympic Games in Tokyo, the logistics requirements expanded to include movement tracking, not just for the athletes but also for apparel, equipment, and other essential items. For all of these undertakings, the team relied on Tableau visualizations to streamline the information and keep track of progress, with vizzes projected onto walls throughout the Olympic and Paralympic Village. Meanwhile, the committee's public-facing business uses engagement metrics to track the many diverse members of the Team USA fan base across more than 50 sports and 90 disciplines, and applies this data in part to qualify superfans for targeted notifications and promotions. To manage this effort and optimize marketing performance across all channels, the USOPC built a Daily Marketing Dashboard and various social media tracking dashboards that visually portray all marketing activity and enable drilling down into user segments and specific campaigns. The dashboards incorporate Salesforce Marketing Cloud capabilities for sending targeted emails, such as alerts about favorite athletes being named to the team. \u201cWe have an incredible opportunity and obligation to understand out fans' interests, preferences, and behaviors, so we can provide them with the best content and experience leading up to, during, and after events,\u201d said Team USA. \u201cSalesforce gives us new power to harness a massive amount of fan data to infer those interests, and to serve those personalized experiences at scale.\u201d On the fundraising side, the USOPC recently incorporated Tableau visualizations into Nonprofit Cloud to increase user and donor engagement for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Foundation, the nonprofit that serves as Team USA's primary source of funding. This process consolidated data analysis for fundraising into a single interface, doing away with the need to track multiple applications in order to see the big picture. USOPC also added an interactive, map-based tool that helps users visualize how fundraising prospects are segmented, further streamlining and boosting the business unit's productivity. \u201cUsing Salesforce and Tableau helps us better understand our donors and prospects in an actionable way, and that success leads to more opportunities for the athletes and programs we support,\u201d said Team USA. Overall, this spirit of going all-in with cutting edge CRM analytics and visualization has helped transform the USOPC and Team USA into a digital HQ where decisions are made and activities are conducted with a data-first mindset and a common language that unites and empowers all collaborators to achieve great things."

        "company": "Salesforce",
        "content": "Finance teams are more experienced than most in handling large amounts of data. However, the use of traditional tools like spreadsheets often limits what they can actually do with that data. This was a challenge for Salesforce\u2019s controllership team for Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ). The team comprises more than 40 employees across the region and is responsible for activities such as the month-end close and reporting of financial transactions. The data they rely on comes from more than 100 different systems, including those used to manage payroll, commissions, and expenses. \u201cAt the end of every month and every quarter, we need to pull all these sources of data together within a very short timeframe and accuracy is critical as the data feeds into our earnings announcements,\u201d said Benson Wong, Vice President, APJ Controller, Salesforce. \u201cThe complexity involved in managing all the data residing in different systems and formats drove the need for a single source of truth.\u201d Tableau now serves as that single source of truth for the team and has increased the efficiency of data consolidation and reporting. More importantly, it has enabled the team to spend more time analyzing data, identifying trends, and providing insight rather than just reporting on past results. The controllership team in APJ was not alone in wanting to improve data management. Soon after Salesforce\u2019s acquisition of Tableau, a global project kicked off to embed the analytics platform within the broader finance team. For Benson, this solidified the need for his team to quickly change its ways of working. Benson appointed two team members to lead the way, Hong Lu and Yvonne Borgert. Hong Lu is Senior Manager, Finance while Yvonne is Director, Finance. Together, they came up with a comprehensive plan for training and adoption based on a ratio of 70% of learning through training and community sharing and 30% through self-learning and practical application. They also set an initial target for every team member to become a Tableau Viewer, meaning they would be able to understand dashboards on their own and make data-driven decisions. To achieve this target, Hong Lu delivered training once a month and homework assignments were provided in between. The homework required team members to use Tableau to solve accounting operation challenges and then present their findings and experiences back to the group. Challenges included analyzing what type of payroll taxes were being paid in each country within Asia Pacific and identifying different types of intercompany transactions. Hong Lu set up a \u2018data clinic\u2019 to help team members with their homework and answer questions regarding Tableau. These one-on-one and small group tutoring sessions helped to truly propel learning. They also augmented the group training and practical application of learnings to smooth adoption, resulting in 100% of the team becoming Tableau Viewers within seven months. Executive sponsorship contributed to this success and helped to counter initial resistance to change. In fact, Benson himself completed a series of training to become a Tableau Creator, meaning he can create visualizations and dashboards for others to interact with. \u201cNow everyone in the team uses Tableau because they\u2019ve experienced for themselves how easy and convenient it is to access the data they need. However, we had to set the tone from the top and lead by example or we may not have progressed as fast as we did,\u201d said Benson. The controllership is now close to reaching additional targets of 100% of the team becoming Tableau Explorers and more than 50% becoming Tableau Creators. It is also building a community of super users who will help to grow the team\u2019s data culture and promote best practice. The community will also serve as a first line of support to other users in their region. At the same time, the controllership is proactively sharing its journey to help drive adoption across the wider finance team. It is also leading by example and embedding the use of Tableau into processes like the month-end close and quarterly business reviews. Some of the benefits achieved so far include up to 67% time savings for balance sheet reconciliations and greater efficiency of month-end close. The controllership has more time to apply its new data skills which will ultimately help it provide more strategic support to the business. For example, it will be able to better identify trends or anomalies in spending and use these insights to help business lines manage their costs."

        "title": "With Tableau, digital transformation at KeyBank integrates people, processes, and data",
        "company": "KeyBank",
        "content": "KeyBank is one of the 20 largest banks in the United States, with more than 900 branches and nearly 1,300 ATMs across the U.S. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, the bank employs about 18,000 people. Parent company KeyCorp has a banking legacy dating back to 1825 spanning investment management, retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, consumer finance, investment banking products, and other financial products and services.  Like many traditional banks, KeyBank focused on deepening commercial and branch-based customer relationships face-to-face. However, digitally savvy younger consumers drove demand for online banking transactions. This demand expanded significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic for home-bound customers of all ages. \u201cWe lived through a time where we needed to automate a lot of the decisions that you used to rely on people to make one-on-one,\u201d said Ben Sabloff, KeyBank's Executive Vice President of Enterprise Analytics. \u201cPushing those decisions to the digital interface required a different approach to the use of data and the deployment of data and insights across the company.\u201d   The executive team began its digital transformation initiative to modernize, which meant investing significantly in a digital, technological, and data-driven future. \u201cKeyBank is one of the largest players in this space,\u201d Sabloff said. \u201cDeploying analytic solutions, capabilities, and technology competitively across our customer base can help secure our place in the long-term future of banking.\u201d The first requirement was to redeploy on-premises data infrastructure to the deployment. Analysts needed access to thousands of data sources across the company for various use cases. It was also critical that all employees using the data\u2014from technical analysts to business users\u2014were equipped with the tools they needed to drill down and understand multiple layers of information. Sabloff said, \u201cOur mission was to advance the analytic capabilities of the bank, and integrate analytics and business decision making, not as a separate department, but a competency across all of KeyBank and something that we deploy everywhere, every day.\u201d The company needed a robust data infrastructure and the right tools and to support that vision.   KeyBank had diverse data analysis requirements across the company and many employees who interacted with data on a regular basis. \u201cWe have data-oriented users that are building reports, pulling data from our databases, and preparing data for use and analytics,\u201d said Sabloff. \u201cBut we have a lot of our team that use data as dashboards and reports, and updates of performance across our entire branch infrastructure.\u201d KeyBank selected Tableau as its data analytics solution. Sabloff added that it met the need for immediacy, accuracy across the business, and ability to connect hundreds of different product performance databases and insights into simplified reporting. \u201cTableau really shined and allowed us to deliver a solution that was so important and big across our infrastructure, and was seamless for non-data users to access this information.\u201d It was the largest deployment at KeyBank: nearly 10,000 employees accessed information delivered through Tableau dashboards as a critical component in their day-to-day operations, as well as daily and weekly performance reports. For example, thousands of branch employees who met with customers daily needed frequent access to data in order to help clients and offer personalized interactions, as well as to help cross-sell and upsell financial products. To support this work, the new system used Tableau dashboards to deliver and distribute incentive compensation infrastructure reports to those branches. Along with ease of data visualization, an intuitive user interface enabled non-technical users throughout KeyBank to drill down multiple data levels into the tool. Sabloff said, \u201cThis capability is very powerful for us to push the data and understanding deeper than a basic report.\u201d He also pointed out that decision makers have a richer level of data at their fingertips in seconds, when it used to take days or weeks working with analysts before Tableau. As part of the KeyBank transformation, Sabloff and others made it a priority to bring everyone on board, including technical and non-technical users from all areas of the bank, to help cultivate and elevate a new kind of data-focused culture. As Sabloff explains it, \u201cIt's important to put data tools in the hands of the actual people who are making decisions and running the business. This is what our analytics vision at KeyBank comes down to\u2014supporting the needs of people who run the business day-to-day, wherever they might be in terms of technical skills or where they sit within the organization.\u201d In all of this focus on people, the human component of understanding enabled by data visualizations in Tableau play a significant role. \u201cTableau has been really a powerful resource for us to integrate our data across the organization,\u201d said Sabloff. \u201cBut specifically as a visualization tool it's extremely powerful. And so by implementing Tableau dashboards and visualizations, we're bringing it together.\u201d As Sabloff describes it, the visualization power for KeyBank employees is often about the ability for non-technical people to get access to deep levels of data across the organization. In a typical use case, a user sees a monitoring report in Tableau, and then simply points and clicks to drill down multiple levels. Said Sabloff, \u201cThat's really powerful for us to push data and understanding levels deeper than a basic report across the organization.\u201d With data enabled and deployed across the organization, along with information security, reliability, and systems running smoothly, the next initiative is to use those rich data sets for analytical purposes. \u201cWe need analysts and business leaders to access and drive data to make decisions and to model performance,\u201d said Sabloff. \u201cUltimately, we'll need to take that data and redeploy it in real time across the rest of the organization.\u201d The bank also plans to build up new capabilities for the \u201cconsumer layer\u201d of the digital experience\u2014and Tableau is at the center of this experience, acting as the data source connector and access enabler. Sabloff pointed out that banking consumers want a unified interface for all of their financial transactions, from their bank accounts and mortgage to their auto loans and credit cards, including accounts that might live at different companies. \u201cIf you're not able to consolidate that information and make it easy, you risk losing that customer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to meet as many of our client needs as we can.\u201d Another critical evolution will be developing talent and capabilities to operate in this new environment. Sabloff said that the management and leadership team will plan and assess the management structure and transform their organization to meet the moment. \u201cI think it's really important for people to understand the energy behind this transformation, the digital transformation at Key, and how this is not just your average regional bank,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a bank that is committed and understands how much it needs to change, and is committed to investing in the talent and the culture and the infrastructure that's needed to do that.\u201d Not only will KeyBank reconfigure internally, but they'll also make it a priority to attract the right analytical talent. In the current environment, there is a race to find savvy employees who can analyze, model, and deploy those data-driven insights effectively across the banking business. \u201cI think a lot of the talent game really has to do with your culture,\u201d said Sabloff. \u201cAre you creating a culture of growth and development? Are you really focusing on the people that are there and making sure they're having the great experience that they need to want to continue to be there?\u201d For KeyBank, integrating this culture of growth with a culture of data is the ultimate goal of their transformation with Tableau. \u201cOur bank is on a transformational journey to deploy data in more powerful ways, using modeling and statistical tools to help us make better decisions, products, and experiences for our customers,\u201d said Sabloff. \u201cDeploying analytic solutions and technology in a competitive way across our customer base assures that we have a place in the long-term future of banking. We've been here for 200 years, we'd like to be here for 200 more\u2014and I think this is the crux of our ability to do that.\u201d"

They are also increasingly data-driven. \u201cOne of our core values at Sompo Asia is curiosity. Access to data through Tableau and empowering employees to ask questions has enabled many of my colleagues to challenge themselves and others. It also allows us to continually align everyone towards our strategic goals,\u201d said Aditya Tibrewala, Chief Technical Officer of Sompo Asia. \u201cAs a result, we have become more focused, and there is more trust and confidence which are essential traits for creating a collaborative culture.\u201d Availability and accessibility of data was previously a challenge for Sompo Asia. There was no single source of truth for information. Instead, most employees relied on IT to extract reports from systems using tools like SQL. The reports were not always easy for non-technical users to understand and any advanced analysis had to be carried out by actuarial teams. Three years ago, the management decided they needed a solution that would empower all employees to harness the value of data. They chose Tableau as they wanted a strong foundation for data processing and management, visualization, and analytics. Tableau was also easy to scale, making it an ideal solution to roll out across different markets. Sompo Asia\u2019s implementation journey began with creating awareness about the benefits and power of business intelligence among senior leaders. \u201cWe believed that unless top leadership and decision makers understood the benefits, it would be impossible to drive commercial outcomes, even if we were to implement the best available technology,\u201d said Aditya. Awareness activities included sharing a case study on the motor claims. The team was one of the first to adopt Tableau and, by analyzing past claims data, they identified opportunities to increase efficiency. They also improved claims settlement turnaround times in some areas by 20% as a result. Promoting success stories like these combined with structured training programs has helped Sompo Asia to grow its Tableau user base from just five people in one team to more than 200 in eight markets. These include employees in areas like sales, marketing, pricing, and underwriting in addition to claims. \u201cData skills are widely required, though not readily available. Hence, it is crucial to find and empower people in the organization who love data, talk about it all day, and share it with everyone around them,\u201d said Aditya. Aditya added that bringing senior management into Sompo Asia\u2019s data community made its transition to a data-driven business smoother and sustainable. Sompo Asia has created what it refers to as \u201cOne Source of Truth\u201d using Tableau. This source of truth helps to create a common understanding between teams on what\u2019s required to meet the goals and objectives of the business. For example, marketing and pricing teams can have more productive discussions about pricing based on factual data on competitor pricing and profitability. In addition, Sompo Asia has adopted four key pillars for data-driven decision-making. These pillars include: \u201cData removes ambiguity from discussions and speeds up the decision-making process, therefore driving more productivity and engagement in meetings,\u201d said Aditya. Sompo Asia now uses data to inform all kinds of decisions and to identify ways to improve the customer experience and growth. Tableau supports the business by simplifying analysis of financial, operational, industry, and policy and claims data. It is therefore easier to identify things like which segments are most profitable and subsequently change pricing or marketing strategies to increase market share. The benefits of Sompo Asia\u2019s data journey are reflected in its financial results. These include a more than 6% increase in profitability of motor insurance in some key markets. Sompo Asia plans to build on these benefits with a focus on increasing Tableau usage amongst existing users first. It also sees data analytics evolving towards self-service and more automated intelligence. \u201cData is even more critical for insurance companies as we not only use it for various operational and strategic reasons, but we rely on it to predict future outcomes. As the data structures and quality improve, more and more companies will be able to automate the insights that can be drawn,\u201d said Aditya."

        "company": "Carro Singapore",
        "content": "Singapore-based Carro is one of ASEAN\u2019s fastest growing startups with a valuation of more than $1 billion dollars achieved in 2021. The business\u2019 success stems from a series of innovative services that challenge the traditional way of buying and selling cars. These include Singapore's first contactless online car purchase service, its first car subscription service, and the first region-wide behaviour and usage-based car insurance solutions. Carro has also developed a proprietary pricing algorithm that determines the most favourable prices for sellers and makes it easier for buyers to search for the best deals. \u201cWe want to make the experience of buying a car online easy, seamless, and worry free. We also want to make the process 100% transparent,\u201d said Zi Yong Chua, Chief Operating Officer, Carro. The startup is data-driven in its approach to driving performance and growth, with Zi Yong and other executives using Tableau dashboards to inform every decision. The executives are also leading by example to foster a data culture at all levels of the business. \u201cWe can only be data-driven if our employees are data-driven and that comes from helping them understand the value of data. Having a solution like Tableau helps by accelerating our ability to unlock that value and use data to drive better performance,\u201d said Zi Yong. \u201cIt also contributes to the overall digitization of our workflow.\u201d Prior to using Tableau, Carro used spreadsheets to manually report on and visualize data. These reports took one to two weeks to prepare and were often prone to error, leading the business to seek out a better and faster way to gain insights. \u201cOur business is complex and we are always adding new business lines and expanding into new markets. This created a challenge for us in the past as we had to continually recreate reports and visualizations,\u201d said Zi Yong. As a fast moving startup, Carro adopted Tableau because of its efficiency in delivering insights from data. The implementation coincided with the delivery of a new ERP where Carro has centralized all the data that once resided in spreadsheets. Tableau connects to the ERP, enabling users to surface up-to-the-minute information from across the business. Reports and visualizations now take one to two days to prepare as opposed to one to two weeks and regular weekly reporting is automated. Executives can also track every aspect of the business. For example, there are dashboards to track return on investment (ROI) for each project and to measure team productivity. Information like inventory levels and adherence to service level agreements (SLAs) are also tracked in near real-time, helping executives make better decisions and optimize team performance \u201cWe\u2019ve built a strong foundation of dashboards that help us to benchmark and drive the efficiency of our operations and expose any gaps or processes to be improved,\u201d said Zi Yong. The use of Tableau is growing with users including executives across departments such as business intelligence, finance, and human resources.  The next step for Carro is to empower more of its executives and frontline managers with data to help them make day-to-day decisions. \u201cWe\u2019re now starting to create reports and dashboards that are more relevant to our frontline and motivate them to do more with their data,\u201d said Zi Yong."

        "company": "Nippon Gases ",
        "content": "Nippon Gases, part of Nippon Sanso Holdings Corporation (NSHD), is one of the leading suppliers of industrial and medical gases in Europe. With over 150,000 customers in sectors as diverse as metallurgy, wastewater treatment, healthcare and the food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, it is present in 13 countries, with a range spanning anything from the most efficient supply option to applications technology solutions tailored for every customer or partner. And it does all this with a clear vision: to create social value through innovative gas solutions that increase industrial productivity, improve human wellbeing and contribute to a more sustainable future. The Information Technology (IT) department provides global support to Europe based on the principle that digitalization is the basis for innovation. In this respect, Nippon Gases is firmly committed to new technologies, and has set itself the goal not only of optimizing its efficiency, but also of improving customer experience and service.  The importance of data is ingrained in the company DNA, and the company has always paid particular attention to analytics. This vision was enhanced even further after its incorporation into NSHD (at the time TNSC - Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation) in 2018. As director of Enterprise Applications at Nippon Gases, Elena L\u00f3pez recalls this \u201cwas a turning point for us, because the European business had to start operating independently, and with that in mind we had to manage all our own applications\u201d. It was at this point that the company placed its trust in the supplier it already had, Tableau, to cover its analytics needs. The initial situation was characterized by the existence of diverse analytics tools. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t maintain our entire portfolio of analytics tools and we took advantage of the situation to consolidate,\u201d the director points out. Despite the fact that, of the three tools implanted in the organization Tableau was not the most widely-used one, the balance tipped in its favor because \u201cit was the one we saw as best placed on the market, with extremely good visual capacities. And on top of this it was easy to learn and simple to use\u201d. After a successful initial phase, when efforts focused on the migration of the rest of the analytics tools to Tableau, the latter has become an absolutely cross-cutting solution at Nippon Gases. \u201cAlthough there is still some way to go in terms of implementation in certain businesses and regions, Tableau is present in many areas of the company, adapted and focused on the needs of each department,\u201d says \u00c1ngel Montero, the company\u2019s Data Analytics Manager. Implantation began in the Operations department, as this was where it had been used most intensively in the past, and it quickly expanded to other departments like Accounting, Accounts Receivable, Distributor Sales, Accounts Payable to suppliers or the Technical Services department for all the operations of technicians dealing with installations, corrective or preventive maintenance etc. \u201cIn Accounts Receivable, for example,\u201d Elena L\u00f3pez explains, \u201cit plays a fairly significant role, because for us, financial KPIs are very important, such as (Days Sales Outstanding) or aging in order to see, customer by customer, what the situation is in terms of payment collection, default, deviations, etc., and make decisions based on this\u201d. Given the size of Nippon Gases, with 130 production plants and over 600 trucks undertaking distribution to supply its broad network of customers throughout Europe on time, the Enterprise Applications Director points out that \u201cour main cost in our production and distribution process is always energy and transport, so many of the analyses we carry out will optimize these two areas\u201d. As such, the Operations department plays a leading role. Jes\u00fas Gallego, the European Director of this department, which covers the air separation plants that produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon, and the coordination of distribution, explains how the analytical capacity provided by Tableau translates into improved processes and cost savings.  Likewise, the analytical power Tableau provides is also used to make proactive decisions. Jes\u00fas Gallego illustrates this point by explaining how analytics are applied to the process data of a compressor in a production plant. \u201cBy analyzing all of the variables that are involved and visualizing these calculations, Tableau can give us an early warning before an incident such as overheating occurs\u201d.  Forewarned, the Operations department can make preventive decisions, helping to improve the availability and reliability of the production plant. \u201cWithout Tableau, this could not be have done previously, because we had no way of visualizing so much data,\u201d says the Director. It is now also possible to gain a complete overview of all of the production stops that have occurred in plants, and as a result the cause will sometimes lead to a technical bulletin being sent out to the other plants in order to prevent similar incidents.   The advantage of Tableau lies not only in massive process automation, but also in the fact that if changes occur in consumption patterns, the update is automatically reflected in the analysis, allowing for improvement in the service provided to customers and ensuring a continued, reliable supply of gas in line with their needs. From Jes\u00fas Gallego\u2019s perspective, \u201cTableau has contributed to data democratization,\u201d with information that was previously kept within a small group of people with ample experience (heads of plants, logistics, etc.) now shared and accessible for the rest of the organization. The centralization of all the information in a single place, and the ease with which it can be visualized, has brought with it a change in decision-making with a data-driven model.  Elena L\u00f3pez maintains that \u201cthanks to Tableau, decisions previously based on highly experienced people in our business are now also supported by objective data, which tells us where and how to act\u201d. As a result of this, Jes\u00fas Gallego adds, \u201cwe can now identify opportunities for carrying on with this process of continuous improvement which, without Tableau, would have gone unnoticed among the huge amount of data we handle\u201d.  The next step, according to Angel Montero, is the company\u2019s analytics maturity process, with the goal of becoming a Data-Driven organization, so that every member will be able to consume data in a democratized, unified manner in order to make better decisions in line with the organization's strategic objectives and goals at all times. To achieve this, there is a cultural challenge that will have to be overcome, adapting the technology to the people and creating a management model that allows analytics to be incorporated into employees\u2019 everyday routine."

In the last 100 years, the company has grown to serve over 350,000 medical facilities and covers 13 markets with over 12,000 employees. Within Zuellig Pharma is the Digital and Data Solutions team focused on delivering transformational solutions to make healthcare more accessible. With Tableau, the team has been able to provide the company and its customers with actionable insights to better manage supply chain processes, improve patient engagement, and respond to healthcare challenges such as COVID-19. While Zuellig Pharma may be an established company, it approaches digital and data with a nimble attitude, cultivating a focus on data analytics combined with actionable insights and technology such as blockchain. This allows it to develop timely solutions such as eZVax, a vaccine management solution that\u2019s facilitated delivery of over two million COVID-19 vaccinations. \u201cWe will be looking at a very different healthcare landscape in the next five to ten years, and data and digital will be at the forefront. Key to adding value and addressing the pain points in the industry will be the ability to take the wealth of data generated daily, identify what\u2019s important, and apply those insights to optimize solutions and create new ones,\u201d said Daniel Laverick, Vice President and Head of Digital and Data Solutions, Zuellig Pharma. One way Tableau supports Zuellig Pharma\u2019s mission is by powering ZiP Suite, a real-time data depository offering insights on inventory, pricing, prescriptions and more. The company shares these insights with pharmaceutical customers to help them improve patient engagement and adherence and price their products more competitively. In addition, Tableau as a tool for guided call scripts has helped improve sales force engagement. In one example, as many as 70% of clients followed up on purchase recommendations and call durations between sales reps and customers doubled, leading to the eventual purchase of goods. \u201cOne of the benefits we\u2019ve experienced using Tableau is the ease and ability to unlock actionable insights. We\u2019re also seeing more of our customers coming to us with different pain points and wanting to co-create solutions. Tableau supports that process by making it easy to visualize the data we need,\u201d said Laverick. Zuellig Pharma encourages all employees to sharpen their skills and remain relevant by keeping training a key focus. The business has also pivoted to an Agile way of working and within the Digital and Data Solutions team, there are daily standups to refine the way they manage data. \u201cI personally empower my team to push boundaries and to not be afraid to try new things. Communication is key and if something isn\u2019t working, we learn from it and move on to the next solution,\u201d said Laverick. The team is also helping equip the future workforce with data skills. In partnership with Singapore universities and other educational institutions, Zuellig Pharma has delivered training programmes in which it works with students to solve real-world problems using Tableau visualisations. Asked to share the vision for Zuellig Pharma\u2019s data journey, Laverick shared the team\u2019s focus on building an integrated digital platform that serves as a single source of truth for customers\u2019 growing needs across the region. \u201cTrying to collect, connect and understand data in its multiple forms will continue to drive the business. Whether it\u2019s AI, analytics, or the metaverse, there\u2019s a growing demand for data analytics, which continues to be a key engine to drive future innovations across the Digital & Data team,\u201d said Laverick."

Through its First Media and Link Net brands, the company serves both residential and enterprise markets with a mission to transform lives by providing innovative and exceptional broadband and media services and solutions. Underpinning Link Net\u2019s mission is a growing data culture with employees across the company using Tableau for everything from network monitoring and analysis through to product strategy. It\u2019s a shift in culture for the company where responsibility for data analysis and reporting previously fell to the IT team. Back then, the IT team had a long list of requests for reports which they prepared by scripting or coding. However, a business need to interact with the data provided, led Link Net to Tableau. \u201cIt all started with our marketing team who wanted an interactive tool to present data at every meeting and to provide analysis to the board of management and related departments,\u201d said Brian Bagus Putra, Head of MIS Analytic and Reporting of PT Link Net Tbk. Today, marketing, engineering, sales, product, contact center, and technical support teams are all using Tableau to perform analysis and explore new ideas independently from IT. The result is immediate access to clear, accurate data to guide strategic decisions. Shift to interactive and collaborative data analysis Link Net initially considered three different solutions to simplify data analysis and reporting for non-IT users. The company also wanted to centralize analysis and reporting, so everyone could access the same data at once rather than circulating files by email. Tableau was selected for its ease of use and interactive features. Tableau partner VISIDATA supported the implementation, including server setup and training. Leaders were onboarded first with IT preparing data and building dashboards before transitioning ownership to divisional and departmental MIS teams. Tableau is now connected to several data sources, including SQL Server, Google BigQuery, PostgreSQL (JDBC), Google Sheets, and Excel. Tableau Creators in each division and department use Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server to analyze data and build dashboards. The dashboards are then published to a portal where they can be explored and viewed by leaders and other team members. Now, each division and department can operate this independently, and it is easier to present data and can display the latest dashboards directly from the web portal rather than building presentation slides. Data can also be easily shared. For example, sales and marketing teams have created a joint dashboard that helps them collaboratively monitor and react to sales and product trends. Promoting a data-driven culture Over the past 5 years, Link Net\u2019s Tableau user community has grown by over 75% and the company has come to rely on Tableau to inform its strategy and manage performance. For example, the marketing team uses Tableau to better understand campaign performance, sales trends, and customer behavior. All these insights inform opportunities to improve customer acquisition and retention. The engineering team uses Tableau to analyze and monitor network performance in real-time, helping them anticipate and quickly resolve any issues. Tableau is also used to track product and market trends, helping to inform Link Net\u2019s product development and pricing and ensuring the company stays competitive. Link Net also uses Tableau for deeper analysis to find actionable insight by monitoring retention and collection process and performance as part of churn management. Through these and other use cases, Link Net has experienced a number of benefits. These include increased process efficiencies, revenue and subscribers' growth. \u201cTableau has made it easier for our leaders to access the data they need to make quick decisions and to anticipate and respond to challenges. This has included adapting to new market conditions created by the pandemic,\u201d said Brian. \u201cTableau also provides us with the analysis that brings new ideas, ultimately helping us provide the best services for our customers.\u201d       Our mission is to help our clients rapidly implement and get immediate returns from reliable and proven Bl and Data Management system.

        "company": "PolicyLink logo",
        "content": " Designed to equip policymakers and housing advocates with data on the extent and nature of rent debt in their communities, PolicyLink and its community partners created this Rent Debt Dashboard to inform the local, state, and national advocacy to eliminate debt and prevent mass eviction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mounting rent debt and the potential for mass eviction is one of the most pressing equity issues created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Low-wage workers \u2014 disproportionately people of color \u2014 who\u2019ve suffered job and income losses due to the pandemic represent most of the millions of renters in debt. (See dashboard for characteristics of renters behind on rent. With the Supreme Court\u2019s invalidation of the federal emergency eviction moratorium on August 26, 2021, and the lack of local moratoria in most places, those renters were facing imminent risk of eviction and homelessness.  Throughout the Pandemic, eliminating rent debt has remained an equity imperative and a moral, economic, and public health necessity. Renters of color have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and were more likely to owe back rent, making them more vulnerable to eviction risk.  No rental assistance existed until December 2020 and by July 2021 only 11 percent of the funds were distributed. This left millions of renters in limbo. Data on the share of households behind on rent comes directly from the Census Pulse survey, which has been asking the question \u201cIs this household currently caught up on rent payments?\u201d every two weeks since mid-August 2020. Results revealed the following: The CARES Act provided important unemployment benefits and cash assistance as well as an eviction moratorium that helped many pandemic-impacted renters, however, undocumented and mixed-status families were ineligible for assistance and the moratorium ended in July of 2020, leaving renters unprotected until the CDC enacted its moratorium in early September 2020. The CDC administratively extended the initial order three times: through March 31,June 30, and July 31, 2021. Absent meaningful financial assistance to pay back rent, the moratorium simply delayed eviction, yet the federal government provided no rent relief until December. Amidst the continued spread of COVID-19, evictions will have disastrous impacts on public health: Research during the pandemic found that states that allowed evictions to proceed had more Covid infections and deaths than those with eviction moratoria. And particularly at a time when rents are increasing everywhere, eviction will increase homelessness, with its devastating consequences for health and well-being and significant costs for local governments. Following the Advocacy Explorer approach, here is a look at the data advocacy approach PolicyLink and partners adopted in pursuit of their collective goal:  The steps of landscape analysis, stakeholder, and power mapping were completed before this particular advocacy need. PolicyLink\u2019s stakeholders are established and consist of a large advocacy network that identifies policymakers nationally at the city, county, and state levels. The idea for gathering detailed rent debt estimates emerged as a response to the needs observed on the ground, by various community partners within the PolicyLink network. These local partners took the lead in identifying elected officials who sat on county boards, state budget committees, and those voting on the proposed rent relief legislation.  Example:Raise the Roof Coalition\nTargeted Stakeholder: Contra Costa County, CA Board of Supervisors\nData to engage and advance policies: Fact Sheet: COVID-19 Evictions in Contra Costa County This data discovery journey started with a request by PolicyLink partner, Raise the Roof! Coalition,  to estimate how many households were struggling with back rent and, therefore, at risk for eviction if the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors allowed its eviction moratorium to expire. Another tenant advocate partner in San Mateo County suggested that having an estimate of how much back rent was owed would be helpful, and the Right to the City Alliance said that more access to the Household Pulse Survey would be helpful. The data discovery phase utilized the following sources: The estimates presented in the initial Rent Debt Dashboard included data gathered and analyzed before August 30, 2021. View methodology here. As the campaign evolved, the methodology was updated to include a larger number of geographic areas, being inclusive of the massive rent debt crisis, primarily driven by the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout. Low-wage workers, who are disproportionately workers of color, were hardest hit by Covid-related job losses and are most vulnerable to suffering from rent debt. The pandemic exacerbated pre-existing housing insecurity for renters of color \u2014 especially women of color \u2014 who were already most likely to be rent-burdened and at risk of eviction. With the update, the Rent Debt Dashboard now includes estimates of the number of renter households in all states and counties, 558 cities and census-designated places (those with at least 10,000 renter households), and 15 metropolitan regions. And as the federal relief programs started to provide support, the dashboard also described methods used for incorporating Emergency Rental Assistance data from the US Treasury into the \u201cRelief Map.\u201d View the full methodology. The question of how many months the household is behind on rent was added in the Phase 3.2 Pulse Survey, beginning July 21, 2021. Prior to this question being added, national estimates of the distribution of rent arrears were derived from the University of Southern California\u2019s Center for Economic and Social Research\u2019s \u201cUnderstanding Coronavirus in America\u201d panel survey. The Pulse survey data was preferable for many reasons: This shift to using the Pulse data on the distribution of arrears has had a significant impact on rent debt estimates, due to the higher share of households that are less than three months behind in the Pulse survey (as compared with the USC survey). Rent debt estimates are now based on two sources of data: PolicyLink created awareness for the Rent Debt Dashboard through the following engagement activities that included communications, PR, community outreach, and speaking at events.   For Policylink and its partners, this successful advocacy campaign was powered by an intentional, methodical approach to the use of data in its advocacy. The collaborators were able to quickly draw out their landscape analysis to identify and map stakeholders and power brokers, convene those influencers, and clearly communicate--in part through locally-relevant data-- a shared vision for a policy initiative. What began as a data tool to assist those advocating for renters during the pandemic recovery, continues to impact public policy debates and concerns about the rent debt crisis in America. The authors behind this work include Sarah Treuhaft, Michelle Huang, Alex Ramiller, Justin Scoggins, Abbie Langston, and Selena Tan.  Explore the currentmethodology used for estimating the number of renter households behind on rent and the total and per household rent debt for the United States as a whole.

        "content": "This story was originally published by our Tableau Premium partner in Romania, btProvider. The original white paper can be found here.  OTP Bank Romania, a subsidiary of OTP Group, is an integrated and self-financed provider of financial services in Romania.  When the pandemic started, the international health crisis changed customer behaviour and influenced the overall activities of most industries in the world economy. The banking sector faced many challenges that tested its resilience, adaptation capacity and its power to make real-time changes. At OTP Bank Romania, digitalisation and data analysis played a major role in the process of understanding the impact of the pandemic on customers. Specialists from OTP problematised what kind of effects the pandemic would have on the economy and how customers would react in these challenging times.   OTP Bank Romania started their digital transformation well before the pandemic began. This initiative included a lot of processes to further improve the customer experience, internal efficiencies and to allow employees to interact much more with customers.  \u201cOTP Bank Romania started the digital transformation journey about two years ago, putting the customer at the centre of everything we do,\u201d says Constantin Mares, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Digital Division, at OTP Bank Romania. \u201cTherefore, we tried to bring everything that is top-notch experience and technology when it comes to our customers.\u201d  Most significantly, they also started an agile transformation in changing and adjusting the way of everyday work. \u201cBefore working from home, we gathered at a table, looked at the data, reports, analytics, discussed them and explained the terms,\u201d says Cristian Popa, CRM Manager at OTP Bank Romania. \u201cAfter working from home, the data had to speak for itself, and Tableau helped in this process.\u201d   It\u2019s imperative that financial services institutions have a solid analytics infrastructure that can handle data and automation at scale. With Tableau, any business team can use visual analytics to ask additional questions and fully explore the data, instead of merely crunching the numbers.  Customers expect banks to connect all the dots and deliver omni-channel experiences that are seamless, personalized, and insightful. Whether customers visit branch locations or engage on mobile apps, it\u2019s essential that at enterprise level, a bank fully understands, anticipates, and serves their needs.  OTP Bank overcame the challenges embedded in the concept of big data manipulation by using Tableau, which provided them with a real-time, dynamic self-service visual analytics platform.  The management team decided in January 2020 to implement Tableau with the help of data specialists from btProvider. After only 6 months, in June 2020 the deployment extended within the organisation.  \u201cbtProvider specialists managed in a short period to create and automate a dashboard that we are following on a monthly basis and now, with zero coding skills I can personalise these reports and follow up with more than 100 KPIs for our transformational program in OTP Bank,\u201d says Bogdan Chiriac, Portfolio Manager at OTP Bank.  In the above mentioned example, 6 people were working on approximately 100 KPIs on a monthly basis: dragging things into PowerPoint, crunching the data and trying to understand it. After implementing Tableau, just one 1 person now spends a maximum of 2-3 hours per month, doing all 100 KPIs, which are easy to access and understand, as well as extremely useful for those who access them.  Before using Tableau, most of the reports delivered by  the bank\u2019s departments, as well as the data processing required to produce these reports, were done manually. This took exponentially longer to create these reports and there was an increased focus on the actual delivery, rather than spending time on actually analysing and explaining the results and subsequently taking timely and appropriate actions and making decisions.  So far, 169 people in OTP Bank Romania use Tableau, and above 120 are working in various branches and the other users operate at the OTPs headquarters, as the initial push was to service the areas with the highest informational gap.  OTP Bank puts a lot of emphasis on the continuous development of a structured data culture in the company. They are constantly upgrading their processes and they started to see more and more what else they could do with their data. The pandemic accelerated the adoption process of a true data culture at OTP Bank. They are focusing on strategic partnerships for continued innovation to drive an even better customer experience.  Today, as a result of the implementation and adoption of Tableau, the company aims to gain as much customer insight as possible at this moment in their journey, without having to inconvenience customers by asking the same questions again and again. Using Tableau, they are better prepared to quickly find the required answers, an aspect that provides a highly valuable competitive advantage in the Romanian banking sector. The journey is not over yet, as more and more areas from the bank move towards Tableau usage. Data visualisation empowered them to make faster decisions, to navigate through data with ease and to observe and analyses the stories that data tells with curiosity.  \u201cNowadays, navigating a journey to a data-driven organisation requires the willingness to adapt to new challenges, requires being objective-oriented, and requires massive support from the entire organisation on all levels,\u201d says Alex Stancescu, Head of Analytics at btProvider. \u201cOTP Bank Romania, managed to inoculate all these in the company\u2019s DNA.\u201d "

        "company": "Ocado",
        "content": "Ocado Retail is alive to the value of data in every customer interaction. This modern organisation \u2013 the world\u2019s largest dedicated online supermarket \u2013 has standardised on a forward-thinking Tableau embedded analytics strategy to package these insights and monetise them externally. The outcome is the Ocado Retail Data Platform that provides more than 400 fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) suppliers with connected intelligence into product performance and customer shopping behaviour.  The platform leverages the unique nature of the Ocado.com retail data set, the largest and most comprehensive e-commerce data set in the market. Tableau interactive visualisations embedded into dashboards, analytics, and reporting, gives suppliers the fast, easy insights needed to drive sales growth, improve media campaign performance, and win market share. Suppliers that use Ocado\u2019s Retail Data Platform grow 4% faster than those that don\u2019t. And Ocado has ambitions to grow the number of suppliers using the platform from the current 400 to 750. Ocado Retail is a joint venture between Marks & Spencer Group and Ocado Group, a technology-led UK retail business providing leading online grocery services in the UK. Ocado Retail is responsible for ocado.com and Zoom by Ocado, a fast-growing, same-day grocery service. As a digital-only retailer, Ocado Retail collects a treasure trove of data on its customers. Everything from the groceries customers add to their basket, when they buy, and how they navigate Ocado.com is captured in entirety and in real-time. Moving this data from a third party to in-house has become a priority for Ocado Retail, in order to both capture the revenue potential and create an even more rewarding customer experience. Until recently, Ocado Retail relied on a third-party organisation to manage this data commercialisation process but opted to bring the strategy in-house in order to have more control over the data and its development. The result is the Ocado Retail Data Platform: a modern, innovative data platform that is reimagining how Ocado monetises its wealth of retail data and transforming relationships with its growing supplier community \u2013 predominantly leading FMCG organisations. \u201cThe Ocado Retail Data Platform helps hundreds of suppliers to explore insights and use that intelligence to drive sales growth, improve media campaign performance, and win market share,\u201d says Jack Johnson, Head of Retail Data, Ocado Retail. \u201cIt provides our suppliers with embedded dashboard analytics into their product and category performance, including complete department data across all key metrics and customer shopping behaviour \u2013 not just for suppliers\u2019 own brands, but competing ones too.\u201d  Tableau is the heartbeat of this retail data monetisation strategy. The analytics platform provides Ocado Retail\u2019s FMCG suppliers with connected, real-time insight into their brands, from primary sales data and supply chain/product availability, to promotions and whole category web analytics. Suppliers have access to a suite of dashboards tailored by department, giving them the flexibility to build the package that best suits their business needs. Suppliers can subscribe to one of four tiers, depending on the breadth of analytics they need.  \u201cTableau helps our retail supply partners to achieve clarity,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cThe dashboards we deliver provide the embedded analytics they need to become more agile, putting data at the centre of their decision-making.\u201d The main customers for these embedded analytics are national account managers within the FMCG supplier base, who are responsible for managing the relationship with Ocado Retail. Every day, these people use the insights to measure how their end-user customers shop and make decisions regarding range, pricing promotions, new product development, and other criteria. \u201cOur number one goal is to create a common data view between Ocado Retail and the suppliers, so everyone shares the same trusted view of data and talks the same language,\u201d says Johnson.  Basket analytics is one of the most popular Tableau insights, providing suppliers with unique intelligence into how customers shop for individual products. These insights help suppliers understand how customers navigate Ocado.com and how best to optimise decisions across category management. For example, Tableau dashboards show whether a customer reaches a supplier\u2019s product on Ocado.com via the search function, their stored \u2018favourites\u2019, the product description, or other means. \u201cSuppliers can modify their media strategy based on how customers behave. For example, if customers are adding the product into their basket directly from the home page, or perhaps using search more often than expected, this data can be leveraged for both the Ocado.com media plan and for their broader e-commerce strategy.\u201d Tableau is helping Ocado Retail and its community of suppliers to see and understand a vast array of retail data. And this in turn is fuelling growth on the Ocado Retail Data Platform. \u201cEveryone has access to great quality data, and everyone can get all the insights to do their job to the best of their capabilities. This is a game-changer for a company like Ocado,\u201d says Johnson. He adds, \u201cWe initially chose Tableau Cloud as it was designed to connect natively and securely to our existing cloud based database, without the need for any complicated and potentially risky data transfers. This made sharing data with external users simple and secure. It also allowed us to maintain control over who could access that data, and to what degree, with a combination of row level security and advance permission options.\u201d Biztory is a Premier Reseller Partner of Tableau and was instrumental in this implementation. \u201cWe were confident Biztory had the expertise to supercharge the development timelines for the Ocado Retail Data Platform. Instead of a development plan spanning years, we were able to go from project inception to delivery in just nine months. Biztory supported the development of the visualisations and have been an invaluable knowledge hub on embedded technologies. Between us we challenged the typical Tableau Cloud model and implemented a solution with all the benefits of using Tableau Server combined with the speed and scalability of Tableau Cloud,\u201d says Johnson. The analytics experience is as powerful as the data the suppliers are seeing. \u201cEven non-technical users can create interactive, real-time visualisations in minutes,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cIn just a few clicks, they can combine data sources, add filters, and drill down into specific information. Sharing a dashboard requires no programming. That means they can focus on studying the data, not dealing with the technology behind it.\u201d Unsurprisingly, a data culture is blossoming too. \u201cThe Ocado Retail data culture is growing almost as fast as the business itself. You can sense that people are energised by data, they are collaborating around the reports, and making trusted decisions on the back of the analytics they are seeing,\u201d says Johnson. Tableau has also become a valuable talking point during negotiations with suppliers evaluating the Ocado Retail Data Platform. Johnson again: \u201cWhen we mentioned the platform is based on Tableau, people sit up. It\u2019s a real differentiator for us, giving prospective suppliers the confidence that the data they will see is agile, actionable, and intuitive.\u201d"

        "title": "Amstelring creates knowledge-driven healthcare with Tableau Cloud",
        "company": "Amstelring",
        "content": "Amstelring is a professional healthcare organisation based in the Netherlands that specialises in the field of elderly care, nursing and treatment. With dozens of residential care centres and small-scale group homes based in the Netherlands within Amsterdam and surrounding cities, Amstelring enables the elderly and chronically ill to live with complex care needs while still remaining independent as much as possible. Amstelring offers specialist care such as: dementia care, stroke rehabilitation, transfer care at the VUmc, palliative care, care for Huntington's disease and acquired brain injury and mental healthcare. With this range of specialist care, Amstelring takes pride in offering the best quality of care not only for their clients but their employees too. Leveraging data therefore plays a crucial role in the day-to-day running of the business, particularly when supporting client independence and at the same time protecting their safety should immediate care be required. Becoming a data driven organisation which aims to fully capitalise on data requires the right tools and processes to turn raw data into immediate and actionable insights. Milou Homan, data analyst at Amstelring, shares the importance of data analytics for both clients and employees at Amstelring, and how Tableau is supporting their data visualisation needs with their implementation partner Infotopics. Two years prior to Amstelring using Tableau, data analytics systems were outsourced and heavily manual which meant that large amounts of data insights were overlooked and not being leveraged. Client safety alerts, like room motion sensors and client pendant alarms would go off regularly, but without the means to analyse this data, clients and staff were becoming overwhelmed. \u201cEach alarm indicated that a client needed immediate attention when in fact they didn\u2019t. Therefore they would then rush to the attention of the client and enter their room which would cause disruption and confusion,\u201d says Milou. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the means to understand the data on why these alarms were happening so regularly which was impacting client and employee experience due to unneeded disruption.\u201d It immediately became clear that a comprehensive data analytics platform was needed to centralise data from various silos across the organisation and create a single source of truth, for example to identify patterns of behaviour from clients triggering alarms and uncover other inefficiencies across the organisation. \u201cWe needed a platform that could help analyse the data and use the data to indicate if clients really required urgent help and attention. Knowing this would help to improve client care and also reduce the workload of our employees\u201d explains Milou. \u201cOur carers have so much work to do and if we made this right it would free up time for a more relaxed way of working\u201d. Amstelring is using Tableau to train their staff, reprogram their systems and visualise what is happening. By combining data and practical knowledge, they can ensure that clients are provided with alarms that best fit their individual needs. This has also reduced the volume of alarms, as sensors that didn\u2019t serve the right purpose were removed. The total number of notifications has been reduced by 50%.  \u201cWithout these unnecessary interruptions, employees can better focus on the client they are attending to, and clients do not feel like the employee is needed elsewhere,\u201d says Milou. \u201cIt is a big win for everyone. With Tableau, Amstelring has also transformed the way it maintains client healthcare information which is critical to ensuring that clients are always receiving the best quality of care possible. Previously, employees would be required to manually check records every 6 months to ensure client information was reviewed and up-to-date. However, given the number of clients residing in Amstelring care homes, employees would have to randomly select a sample of files to run through in detail and check if any information was missing and that healthcare plans were fully completed - this was heavily manual and subject to human error. Now, the status of all client healthcare plans can be visible in one place. \u201cWe have a quality of care dashboard that displays multiple data points to ensure that we have everything in the right place and flags anything missing so that processes are done more accurately and effectively\u201d said Milou. \u201cIt\u2019s so great that we can now see everything in one place with up-to-date insight into our quality of care at Amstelring with an overview of daily care for our clients. Historically this would take so much time but now it\u2019s as simple as filter and click and you will see any client files that need updating or have missing information. It\u2019s easy to use and directs employees to the right file to take action if needed\u201d Milou also added. This Tableau quality care dashboard can be created centrally and widely shared with employees across care homes, as it would only flag the application ID along with the incorrect or missing data. This notified care homes quickly which sped up the healthcare plan review process and avoided any confidential information being shared with employees who were not authorised to view the  client's personal details Since implementing Tableau toward the end of 2019 alongside partner Infotopics, Amstelring has already seen the benefits of truly leveraging data and as a result, a powerful new data-driven culture is starting to form at all levels of the organisation. \u201cWhat excites me is that after these projects we now have people across the organisation asking us \u2018when can it be my turn to use data,\u201d says Milou. With support from training provided from Infotopics \u201cwe\u2019re now able to empower other people within the organisation to use Tableau. The benefit is that it builds excitement, they don\u2019t need to wait for us and they can now freely use Tableau to create the insights they need to be successful.\u201d Amstelring has only scratched the surface and as Milou concludes \u201cwe would love to combine more data and analyse more trends to improve our overall quality of client care and just as importantly reduce the workload of our employees to improve their wellbeing and empower them to make data driven decisions.\u201d. Infotopics and Tableau are central to this change and with the Tableau platform and Infotopics\u2019 implementation strategy and training, Amstelring will continue to accelerate their knowledge-driven healthcare and improve the lives and well-being of so many to come."

        "title": "IDBS empowers R&D organisations around the world with self-service embedded analytics from Tableau",
        "company": "IDBS",
        "content": "IDBS creates powerful digital solutions for biopharma and other industries, helping over 50,000 researchers in 25 countries achieve faster breakthroughs, accelerate innovation, and bring new products to market. The company\u2019s diverse customer list includes 22 of the world\u2019s top 25 global pharmaceutical companies, along with research and development (R&D) driven organisations from sectors including biotechnology, chemicals, and healthcare. A key part of IDBS\u2019s innovative solutions is Tableau embedded analytics, which empowers scientists and researchers to explore data, interrogate their key findings and uncover hidden insights, all within the same intuitive platform. Here, Alberto Pascual, Director of Data Science and Analytics at IDBS, discusses why the company chose Tableau to power its analytics strategy and the powerful impact it\u2019s having on customers around the world. R&D plays a pivotal role in nearly every industry around the world, but many organisations continually face the same recurring data challenges, caused by outdated processes and infrastructure, that hamper overall research efficiency. \u201cA lot of organisations still store research findings in local spreadsheets or disparate data silos, while error prone manual integration and poorly contextualised data creates barriers that significantly slow down time to insight,\u201d says Alberto. \u201cAs a result, up to 40 percent of researchers\u2019 time is spent on admin, leaving little time to extract insights. Worse than that, only four percent of data is typically used in most organisations, meaning important findings are almost certainly being missed every day.\u201d IDBS\u2019s solutions, such as its market leading E-Workbook and new Polar platform, are designed to solve these endemic data challenges. Built on the company\u2019s three core pillars of Workflow, Integration, and Insights, they streamline data collection and R&D processes, helping to bring life-changing new pharmaceuticals to market much faster than previously possible.  \u201cSolutions like E-WorkBook empower R&D organisations by replacing old processes and disparate spreadsheets with much more efficient ways of working, collaborating and sharing,\u201d adds Alberto. \u201cNot only does it simplify digital data collection in a safe and compliant manner, but it also gives researchers the tools needed to immediately start interrogating their findings, collaborate with others and share key insights for further review.\u201d Central to this process is Tableau embedded analytics, which IDBS uses to underpin the \u2018insights\u2019 pillar of its solution, putting intuitive self-service analytics directly into the hands of researchers. \u201cA lot of self-service analytics solutions are too complicated to use for people who aren\u2019t data experts themselves, which usually results in low uptake amongst target users,\u201d says Alberto. \u201cWe believe that anyone, regardless of expertise, should be able to do advanced analytics, which requires hiding the technology\u2019s complexities and presenting users with a tool that\u2019s simple to use, but also powerful enough to perform complex analysis. Tableau embedded analytics allows us to do just that, facilitating data access, reporting, visualisation, exploration, searches and advanced data interrogation, all in real-time via the same intuitive interface.\u201d  Tableau\u2019s highly visual nature further enhances its appeal amongst customers, offering a huge variety of dashboards and graphical options to help researchers quickly spot small data anomalies and molecular outliers that could lead to a major scientific breakthrough. \u201cThe business impact is huge, both for us and our customers,\u201d continues Alberto. \u201cTogether with Tableau, we can unleash the power of scientific data and create tools which make a direct positive impact on all laboratories using IDBS solutions around the world.\u201d   Another major challenge faced by many research organisations is a lack of data democratisation. Too often, the tools needed to access, view, and interrogate data are restricted to just a handful of individuals within the organisation, making R&D processes long winded and unnecessarily complex. \u201cData democratisation is a problem we encounter regularly amongst customers,\u201d comments Alberto. \u201cAccess, usage, and the ability to easily share data needs to be as easy and fair as possible, but this is rarely the case.\u201d  \u201cFortunately, Tableau can connect to a huge range of different sources, creating a single, unified data platform that the whole organisation can consistently work from,\u201d says Alberto. \u201cFurthermore, the self-service functionality it offers means researchers are no longer reliant on specialist IT teams or data experts to uncover/share meaningful insights. Instead, they can easily do it all themselves.\u201d When considering which embedded analytics provider to partner with, IDBS evaluated several leading market solutions. However, Tableau quickly emerged as the clear winner for a number of reasons. These included the strength of the platform overall, its emphasis on rich visuals, and the support available from Tableau\u2019s incredible global community. \u201cWe wanted an analytics partner with a great out of the box embedded offering, a large user community and a long-term vision. Tableau ticked all those boxes and more,\u201d notes Alberto. \u201cTableau embedded analytics significantly simplifies our offering and accelerates our development cycles. Once conceptualised, it took just three months to take the solution to market. \u201cThe global developer community that supports Tableau is also hugely beneficial,\u201d adds Alberto. \u201cScientific visualisations are complex, but the Tableau community and partner ecosystem provides an extensive support network that IDBS is constantly benefitting from.\u201d \u201cWith the power of Tableau supporting our data science engine, we can bring a new wave of data intelligence to our customers, as well as R&D as a whole, which has been hugely valuable to everyone involved.\u201d"

The 1 connects these members with more than 2,000 brands to provide them with the best experiences and privileges. These brands include Central Group brands such as Central and Robinson department stores as well as partner brands such as Grab and Caltex. The 1 aims to be known as \u2018Your Everyday Lifestyle Application\u2019 for members and merges its expertise in data insight, MarTech, and CRM to deliver the best experience in digital. It uses Tableau to better understand members so that it can offer products and promotions tailored to their needs and interests. Tableau is also used to monitor the performance of campaigns and to identify opportunities for growth. Tableau has played a broader role in making data more accessible and fostering data-driven decision making at all levels of the organization. Prior to adopting Tableau, The 1 relied on the data team to provide everyone with the information they needed to make decisions. Requests for information were put into a queue and teams often had to wait almost 36 hours for a response. In addition, data management was time consuming given the large amount of data held for analytics. The 1 decided to adopt Tableau in order to allow teams to access and visualize their own data. Tableau was chosen in part because of its strong community where users at all levels can go to ask questions or find answers within existing posts online. The 1 also found hundreds of hours of training videos online to help facilitate adoption. BAC, a Tableau implementation partner, was engaged to provide on-site training to IT and infrastructure teams. The rest of the business leveraged resources from the Tableau community as well as the intuitive nature of the platform to learn and grow their own data skills.\nIn the four years since The 1 first adopted Tableau, the number of users has increased by more than 100%. The organization now has more than 200 employees using Tableau to access and analyze data on their own. These included employees from various departments such as Marketing, Operations, and Purchasing. \u201cTableau presents data visually and in a way that\u2019s easy to understand, so the business can self-serve and view performance by business, by branch or by product category,\u201d said Chartsatienpong. With this type of information more accessible, the data team is freed up from basic reporting to focus on in-depth analysis. For example, they can analyze purchases and points usage to better understand member behavior and how to design more relevant and engaging campaigns. Every campaign is measured as well, so The 1 can test and learn by comparing the effectiveness of different tactics and messages. Campaigns and offers can then be improved to optimize results. As The 1 progressed in its Tableau journey, it had to increase the efficiency of data management. The organization holds hundreds of millions of records which need to be accessed regularly for data analytics and refreshing this data into Tableau took up to six hours. The 1 decided to move its data into AWS Redshift and leverage Apache Parquet for more efficient data storage and retrieval. Supported by BAC, The 1 then installed the Tableau Hyper API to extract data from the Apache Parquet files. Now, data refreshes can be completed in just two or three hours and resource consumption of Tableau Server has been greatly reduced. \u201cWith advice and guidance from BAC, we can now manage big data more efficiently and ensure high availability of Tableau,\u201d said Chartsatienpong. In the future, The 1 sees Tableau supporting a greater focus on testing and learning so that it can optimize campaigns and business tactics and establish best practices. The 1 also anticipates an increasing use of AI and machine learning. \u201cDescriptive analytics such as sales monitoring or KPIs will be the basics that every company needs and with Tableau, they will be prepared with less resources and effort,\u201d said Chartsatienpong. \u201cAt the same time, AI and machine learning will be increasingly used for activities such as customer segmentation and product recommendations. We see this type of analysis becoming easier and anticipate Tableau having a role to play.\u201d     "

        "company": "Progressive Insurance",
        "content": "Progressive Insurance is the third largest insurer in the United States, serving 18 million customers with personal and commercial products for cars, homes, motorcycles, RVs, and boats, in addition to life policies and other insurance needs. The company is always on the leading edge of technology\u2014from launching the very first insurance website to pioneering apps for rating and managing policies. The company also leads the way in data culture. From the beginning, they\u2019ve relied on data analytics to make customer decisions, and Tableau helps them be more progressive than ever. \u201cAir, water\u2026 data.\u201d That's how Pawan Divakarla, a Data and Analytics leader at Progressive, describes how essential data is as an element at his company. We caught up with him to find out more about his philosophy on using data as a foundation for leadership and innovation, including why and how data is so key to the company\u2019s success. What are some of the biggest challenges you face in the insurance industry? We have many of the same challenges as financial services, but we have a product that customers may not want to use. It's the opposite of a phone where you want to buy it and you want to use it, which creates an interesting lens to view data. Another challenge is there's much more data coming nowadays. We've grown our customer base over the last few years and they\u2019re staying with us longer. So we have more logins, more bill pays, more of everything, which leads to the sheer volume of data that\u2019s growing and we have to manage it all. Progressive had data culture before it was a concept. Tell us about that. Data is in our DNA and insurance is data-driven. We believe in facts and in understanding the world through the lens of data. In the 1980\u2019s one of our founders coined the term \u2018reverence for data\u2019 because he believed our core values, people, and reverence for data were three foundational pillars to the business. We believe answers to customer problems and needs are in the data, from getting the best rate for the customer, to user experiences, to helping people settle claims. So data follows the insurance value chain in Progressive. How is that reverence for data built into your business strategy? We have a four-step flywheel of data. It starts with our reverence for data and revolves around finding the answer in the data. Second, we hire people who believe in that idea and seek data for answers. Third, we mine the data we have to discover new insights. Lastly, we use those insights to build new products and services, and when they become successful and produce more data, that takes us back to the top. Our flywheel of data got us to this point and will get us to the next growth phase. Data is a vital element at Progressive. It's like: Air, water\u2026 data. And how does your air\u2013water\u2013data philosophy get translated daily? We all revolve around data and have this unwritten philosophy that you bring data \u201cto the table\u201d, and so often people review data analytics in meetings. They'll make a case using data so it\u2019s more than opinions. Another example is my old boss, who presented me a hand-drawn stacked bar chart of data with numbers on it, like Tableau by hand. Those are just a few. When you see all these exhibits on a regular basis, you know this place oozes data. It's those experiences in just about every corner at Progressive tell me that we have reverence for data. How does data culture start from the top at Progressive? Our leaders have always led by example. They review data and then come to us with well-informed questions versus asking what's happening or what happened yesterday. They ask, \u2018Why is this happening?\u2019 They always want more. We try to pre-program commonly asked questions ahead of time and that is constantly changing because you've answered yesterday's questions. It creates another flywheel where we present interesting questions, which leads to them to think about other questions, and this turns into new insights that come out of that exercise. How do you integrate technology in your quest to be data-driven? We think of technology as a toolbox and we have several tools in it. It's about providing business value and whatever tool gets us there. Since we\u2019re an older company, we have a lot of legacy products and new tools, and we use what works best. Our introduction to Tableau started with one user in 2006 and has grown to hundreds because we have so much data and every day we're collecting more and more. We really like Tableau's mission to help people see and understand data. We constantly combine the insights to produce the next business value, so Tableau fits into that picture. We also have databases like SQL server, Oracle, Snowflake and tools like Excel and others that complement Tableau. What are some examples of using data to inform customer decisions? We have so many of them, every minute, every day. One unique tool is called Snapshot that analyzes driving behavior, because we believe that's predictable. We can use that to price and rate our customers as one metric. We\u2019re also in a very rate-sensitive environment, so it helps that customers get the right rate. Progressive also uses data for user experiences to make interactions as frictionless as possible. We know where pain points exist because of the data. We segment and look at the data in aggregate, but also disaggregate the data. You want to keep looking for the next needle in the haystack. Once you find it, then you can use it to improve the customer experience. How else does data help Progressive make decisions? There are many other data sets we watch and use for dashboards. Gasoline demand is correlated with the miles driven, so that\u2019s an important metric to track and translates into rates, for example. We know that more miles driven leads to more claims. It's also a barometer on the economy. If people are driving more, they're probably going to be switching cars more, which means more car sales, and insurance shopping. We also track unemployment because if someone is unemployed, they\u2019re not driving to work, which means they\u2019re at home and not driving as much. All of these also translate back to something that we could use to put better products and services for our customers. How does the emphasis on data help customer relationships? Customers expect companies to look at data and find solutions for pain points. If you're not watching the data and you don't see it, customers won\u2019t be happy, and they will show that by either not joining your company or leaving your company. Similarly to buying a house, you go to a real estate website, do a lot of research, and then meet with the realtor, you're going to ask more specific and pointed questions. Our data experience at Progressive is similar where folks use a self-service approach with a lot of information and data, and then they tend to ask really good questions, and that\u2019s been very helpful. How does data keep Progressive ahead of the competition? It's a very competitive marketplace. A lot of insurance is regulated, which means we file our rates, so others know what you're working on. There\u2019s an element of \u2018which company comes up with ideas first.\u2019 Our culture revolves around data and we're one of the leading institutions for data, but we don't take it for granted. Being aware that the first to find some of these insights does really matter. We've got a team who looks at what's next and new in the data that we didn't know yesterday. Hubris in this space isn\u2019t good because there are many existing companies innovating with data. A lot can change and companies with newer and different business models can overtake incumbents as \u201cinsurtechs,\u201d or insurance technology companies. That's something we think about and watch. In some ways we are our own insurtech, because we use data so much. I think we're on the leading edge, but you can fall off quickly if you're not focused on the mission that keeps you there. What are new data trends Progressive is looking at and using? There\u2019s the next frontiers of data and real-time data is one of them. Artificial intelligence and machine learning is big, and up-and-coming. Because we're running data at scale, data quality and data drift are going to be more important. Also, responsible use of data is becoming more important because in some places the data has bias, and models and algorithms can feed off the data bias, which can cause unintended outcomes. That's an area that we have to watch for and put the customer, their experience, and bias in the center as we make the decisions. Where does the data journey end at Progressive? Digital transformation is like an endless road and every milestone on that road brings more business value and more satisfied customers, and that's keeping the eye on the prize. It\u2019s definitely worth it because from the business value, it improves your bottom line, and from the customer standpoint, they will recommend your products and services to others."

        "title": "Utilizing Tableau as Essential Infrastructure Enabling Management Visualization and Process Reforms through SFA",
        "company": "Hitachi Solutions",
        "content": "It\u2019s a feeling shared by an increasing number of managers: \u201cI want to make active use of data to reform sales processes and visualize the management of the business.\u201d Hitachi Solutions, Ltd. actively utilizes SFA to that end and continues to steadily produce results. Hitachi Solutions plays a central role in the IT sector at the Hitachi Group. Through the information and telecommunications systems business, Hitachi Solutions provides a variety of global solutions that support social lifestyles and business activities. The company has four offices within Japan and eight more overseas. Adding in its five Hitachi Solutions Group subsidiaries, the company has over 12,000 employees globally. Kazuo Hata, General Manager of the 1st Inside Sales Department in the Sales Operations Division of Hitachi Solutions, reflects on their past business activities as follows. \u201cIn the past, we had a lot of meetings for the sake of having meetings. The sales forecasts reported at those meetings were kept within 99-101% of a predetermined budget. The corporate culture was such that business realities were not easily presented up front. For that reason, it was difficult to determine the extent to which certain projects were active and their incoming order acceptance rate, making it difficult to predict sales and earnings.\u201d To resolve these issues, the company decided on a \u201cfull restructuring of SFA\u201d in May 2017. Alongside this, the company also began building data lakes and a BI platform. \u201cThe term SFA contains the word \u2018sales,\u2019 and the core idea there is that all personnel input data that is then used for business management purposes. In other words, this is a management tool, so I felt that if a data utilization platform is not set up alongside the tool, it will be impossible to derive much benefit from it.\u201d \u201cWe were actually considering internal data lakes as a separate project from the full restructuring of SFA,\u201d said Takafumi Kosaka, Group Manager of the 1st Group, Operational Reforms and Digitalization Promotion Center at IT/DX Promotion HQ at Hitachi Solutions. The Hitachi Group was integrating operations across the Group as a whole by transitioning away from individual company-specific systems to a shared system provided by the Group. Kosaka explains that this change made it impossible to have free control over data the way that companies did with their company-specific systems, so there were issues to resolve with respect to user operations and inefficiency. \u201cResolving these issues required internal company data lakes and data usage, which immediately catalyzed initiatives aimed at bringing those things about.\u201d The first stage of data utilization was the provision of raw data in CSV format. The second stage was the provision of processed data that incorporated user needs. However, similar aggregation/analysis work was performed in each respective user department, creating more of a workload than was necessary. \u201cTo resolve these issues, in January 2018 we began to look at the possibility of introducing BI products as a data usage platform for the entire company,\u201d said Aki Shirako, Senior Staff of 1st Group, Operational Reforms and Digitalization Promotion Center at IT/DX Promotion HQ at Hitachi Solutions. It was here, he said, that Tableau was raised as a possible solution. Ultimately, Tableau was adopted as the company-wide BI platform. So why did Hitachi Solutions ultimately select Tableau? Shirako gives three main reasons. The first reason is how easy it is to read Tableau dashboards. He said the dashboards were well-liked because they are bright, simple, and polished. Second, the dashboards are easy for users to customize, making it easy to achieve self-service BI. The IT Department has limited access to personnel, so it is difficult for it to maintain all content (e.g. dashboards, reports). And since there is no limit on how much user data needs will crop up based on changes in businesses and circumstances handled by specific departments, they considered the feasibility of self-service BI to be a hard requirement. \u201cTableau has intuitive user controls, and users can create their own dashboards just by referencing videos available online. I felt that these factors meant self-service BI was possible.\u201d Third, Tableau enables you to start small. Licenses are subscription-based rather than single-purchase, making it easy to start using the service with low initial cost. Hitachi Solutions began with 25 licenses as a trial phase, then increased to 150 licenses six months later. The company then increased the relevant budget the next fiscal year, suddenly acquiring a large number of licenses. The ease with which users can decide to increase their number of licenses while still using the service was another big benefit of Tableau. Adopting Tableau as the company\u2019s BI platform yielded the following types of benefits. SFA-registered cases totaling over three times budget\n\n\n\u201cWhen we first started working on the full restructuring of SFA, we aimed to have the total volume of SFA cases exceed 200% of the budget by March 2020,\u201d said Hata. In reality, SFA-registered cases reached 315% of the budget, marking what Hata says was a fundamental transformation of a company culture that only allowed \u201c99 to 101% of budget to be presented up front.\u201d \u201cAs a result, we are able to make fine-tuned predictions regarding how many leads exist at a given point in time and how sales will shift on that basis.\u201d SFA usage spreading even outside of sales\n\n\nAlthough SFA was initially used only by the Sales Department, it currently has many users even outside of the Sales Department, with license numbers tripling over a four-year period. SFA is steadily becoming established in its core role as the \u201cmanagement tool for the entire company.\u201d Reducing time spent in meetings\n\n\nAs of March 2020, Sales Department meetings had been reduced to two-thirds. In the Inside Sales Department, which Hata leads, zero performance meetings had been held as of the end of March 2021. Cost reduction benefits\n\n\nThe streamlining of operations has also helped to reduce costs. In the first fiscal year of implementation alone, those cost reductions totaled four times investment, including SFA.\u3002 Improvements to business performance\n\n\nPerformance has improved throughout the company since Tableau was first introduced. In the recently established Inside Sales Department, business results have reached 355% of previous-year levels. All of this is believed to be due to a virtuous cycle in which the reduction in unnecessary meetings has led to an increase in opportunities for business discussions with customers. Hitachi Solutions\u2019 current objective is to incorporate all business activities into dashboards by 2027 and enable all staff members to share and utilize them. The company is also aiming to eliminate all performance meetings and conduct company management using real-time data.\u3002 In this way, Hitachi Solutions is in the process of achieving a type of company management that makes use of all data input by all company personnel. This is truly thanks to DX, and the findings derived from this experience are being passed along to Hitachi Solutions\u2019 customers. \u201cHitachi Solutions has been working for many years to provide the latest technologies alongside solutions that are flexible combinations of various products and services,\u201d said Ryosuke Suzuki, Chief Engineer of the 2nd Cross-Market Services Group, Cross-Market Services HQ at Hitachi Solutions. Additionally, the company\u2019s data usage business has existed for over 20 years, and in 2019 it formed a business alliance with Tableau.\u3002 One specific DX-related solution offered by the company based on that expertise and that alliance is its \u201cBI concierge service.\u201d This service helps customers set up data-powered systems by helping them create roadmaps and organize issues along the way, then provides assistance with implementation and improvement of the system itself, as well as with data usage and the establishment of data usage practices at the customer\u2019s company. This service enables customers to draw on others\u2019 expertise and experience to take the shortest possible route to DX promotion that will have a positive impact on their company\u2019s business management. \u201cThe key to making DX succeed is how to best utilize the untapped goldmine of underutilized data,\u201d said Suzuki. The Hitachi Group has over 30,000 Tableau users and has implemented Tableau for customers on over 100 sites, winning the company the Partner Award for both 2021 and 2022. \u201cDrawing on these accomplishments and this expertise, we hope to continue helping our customers utilize Tableau and achieve DX in the future.\u201d"

The company\u2019s brand promise is to \u2018provide surprisingly-friendly solutions for the ones who treasure those tiny moments at home\u2019. These solutions range from air treatment, refrigeration, laundry, large cooking and other kitchen appliances to floor care and lighting\u2014making Midea\u2019s product portfolio one of the most comprehensive in its industry. Midea is headquartered in Southern China, but is a truly global company with more than 100,000 employees and operations in more than 200 countries. The company also works with retailers globally to take its products to market and it has adopted Tableau to analyze data from these retailers. The insights gained help Midea identify opportunities for improvement and expansion and have led to millions of dollars in sales. In the past, Midea analyzed data using spreadsheets, but those not experienced with data analytics found the results hard to comprehend. The company turned to Tableau to make it easier for employees to understand their data, regardless of their previous experience or understanding of data and analytics. In particular, Midea wanted to identify opportunities to expand its retail footprint.It also wanted more insight into customer and competitor trends so that it could improve its product line and better cater to customer needs. Midea partnered with Oak Consulting to implement Tableau and leveraged their expertise to build dashboards and visualize data in the best way possible. Some of the dashboards created help Midea visualize the data received from retail stores so that it can understand market penetration rates and make better decisions about where to expand. Midea has also used Tableau to create a target list of ideal customers and monitor the progress made by the sales team. The ability to prioritize high potential customers has been especially important during the pandemic, given the difficulty in traveling and the need to ensure there are no wasted trips. The strategy has proved successful as well with Midea gaining more than US$10 million in sales in three months, all from new accounts on its target list. Data is now helping Midea shape its product strategy and increase its competitive advantage. For example, the company has dashboards that allow it to better understand customers\u2019 purchasing habits and what product features are most in demand. It also has dashboards that help it identify market changes more quickly and price products more competitively. Midea is now in the process of working with Oak Consulting to build new dashboards which would increase the number of employees using Tableau to understand their data. In the future, Midea sees data analytics being a basic requirement for decision making\u2014especially with all of the data being collected through IoT applications. \u201cI believe Tableau will be at the forefront and leading the charge into a future where data analytics is the necessity and where AI and machine learning are able to generate the analysis we need automatically,\u201d said Yeo Luo Han, Channel Management Specialist, APAC, Midea.

        "title": "SC Asset turns data into a valuable asset",
        "company": "SC Asset",
        "content": "SC Asset is a top luxury real estate development firm in Thailand. The firm\u2019s mission is to make every morning a \u201cgood morning\u201d for every customer and it offers homes and living solutions that support customers to have a better quality of life. These include luxurious condominiums and townhomes as well as single detached houses and office buildings. Understanding the value of data, the firm has established a Corporate Data Science team. The team is responsible for consolidating data across digital channels and legacy systems and for providing employees with insights to make decisions, bolster the firm\u2019s strategy, and improve the customer experience. Using Tableau, the Corporate Data Science team has made it possible for employees to self-serve and access data in real-time, from anywhere at any time. It has reduced time spent on reporting by up to 60% and enabled employees to make fast and informed decisions. In the past, SC Asset had a BI tool in place to support some business units. However, the rest of the firm relied largely on the IT team to create the reports needed to support activities such as inventory management. On average, these reports would take several weeks to produce, making it difficult for employees to get an up-to-date view of what was happening within the business. In addition, the firm\u2019s data was siloed across legacy systems. This made it almost impossible to get a single view of customers and their journey and make fact-based decisions. Data management, security, and governance were managed separately as projects. Seeking to leverage more value from its data, the firm decided to trial Tableau. The primary purpose of the trial was to ensure Tableau matched the needs of employees and could be easily adopted. \u201cWhat we learned through our trial is that Tableau encourages non-technical users through features like drag-and-drop reports. Tableau also has a large user community that we can leverage to find out about new use cases,\u201d said Charoenpanichsiri. Still, there was a learning curve for employees who had come to rely on IT for reporting. Training was therefore an important part of the implementation process and was supported by an internal engagement campaign which promoted data as a valuable asset. SC Asset partnered with Bara Advanced Infotech Co., Ltd on the Data Warehouse and Data Analytics project which involved connecting Tableau to core systems such as supply chain systems, sales and marketing systems, and SC Asset\u2019s internal Bann Ru Jai mobile application. Tableau was also used to set the standard for data management, security, governance, and accessibility across business units. The firm worked with its partner to develop Tableau training and delivered user training for each implementation phase. It also conducted a Tableau dashboard roadshow to showcase dashboards to relevant business units. Additional training on specific dashboards has been provided to smaller user groups on occasion. SC Asset now has more than 100 employees using Tableau. This represents a 40% growth in users from the firm\u2019s initial implementation. The Corporate Data Science team are the primary users, but individuals from several departments are also using Tableau as Viewers. These include Accounts, Finance, Marketing, Product Development, Business Support, Customer and Home Service, Contact Centre, Quality Control, Customer Management, Sustainable Living Solution, IT and Internal Audit. There are plans to run a data hackathon to draw in more users and also a roadmap which SC Asset calls \u2018TabPy\u2019 which includes courses and campaigns to help users become proficient in data analytics with Python. Through these and other initiatives, SC Asset also wants to inspire users to upskill their talents, leveling up from Tableau Viewers to Explorers and from Explorers to Creators. The Tableau community supports SC Asset\u2019s increasing data maturity with support and information on how to build more complex formulas to answer more complex business questions. Tableau has transformed how the firm views and understands its data. Reports can now be produced in days as opposed to weeks and many employees are equipped with the skills to self-serve and conduct their own analysis on the data provided. The Corporate Data Science team has also created a number of automated reports which employees can access from anywhere. These reports allow employees to visualize data in real-time, helping them to make fast and informed decisions. This has been especially crucial during the pandemic as executives needed data at their fingertips to react quickly to new situations. \u201cOne of the benefits of Tableau during the pandemic has been the accessibility of data. Our users can access reports from anywhere, in real-time and have discussions with their colleagues knowing they are looking at the same source of truth,\u201d said Charoenpanichsiri. One dashboard that\u2019s especially useful for the firm is its inventory dashboard which makes it easy to see where there are unsold units and also where there is too much stock vs where there are shortages. The dashboard helps users make the best decisions when forward planning how to manage their inventory and make the highest margins. SC Asset also has quality control dashboards that enable multiple departments to access the same data and work together to monitor quality. In terms of quality control, the firm emphasizes cost effectiveness and uses data to compare things such as vendor capabilities, quantities, and defects. Tableau has also made it easier for SC Asset to capture customer profiles and track objectives and key results related to the end-to-end customer lifecycle. It has also helped the firm to track and react faster to customer feedback. SC Asset has also enhanced the customer experience in regards to maintenance and repair issues. For example, by analyzing the relationship between demographics and essential details about a property, the firm can better predict the need for and manage services such as pest control, gardening, and lifestyle services. Leveraging data in this way will become even more important as customer behavior changes more rapidly. \u201cIn the future, we envision customer behavior changing in a microsecond. We also envision less brand loyalty and a greater focus on data privacy. Consequently, we\u2019ll be looking at Tableau to help us make data analytics faster, easier, and more ingenious,\u201d said Charoenpanichsiri.   "

        "company": "Jaguar Land Rover",
        "content": "Jaguar Land Rover will become a more agile creator of the world\u2019s most desirable luxury vehicles and services for the most discerning of customers with a strategy that is designed to create a new benchmark in environmental, societal and community impact for a luxury business.  It is committed to producing a pure electric Jaguar portfolio by 2025, with zero tailgate-emissions for all vehicles by 2035, and zero emissions in the supply chain, products and operations by 2039. No doubt this makes an incredibly impactful sustainability statement.  We spoke to Clive Benford, Jaguar Land Rover Data Office Director, about how Jaguar Land Rover manages this in the face of global competition and complex supply chains. Clive explains that Jaguar Land Rover does this profitably and globally, while recognising local markets and regulations do not always move at the same pace.  In some ways it is a perfect storm. Electric is a once-in-a-generation engineering challenge. Cars are  now software products,  computers on wheels. And there is a changing ownership model, with consumers looking to hire or use a car as a service.  \u2018Reimagine\u2019 is our strategy to become an electric-first business with a focus on modern luxury by design. The goal is to create new benchmarks in quality and efficiency for the luxury sector.  Our CEO Thierry Bollor\u00e9 described it best: \u201cThe central nervous system of our new structure will be a radical digital transformation. Data is the backbone of new products, the lifecycle of existing products, the quality of our manufacturing, the oxygen of our supply chain, and the services we can provide to our customers in the future.\u201d    Put simply, it is to empower all our employees to interrogate their data, find insights and develop valuable use cases themselves. We do this with a robust governance framework, so our employees trust the data, and can share insights freely and securely. This has improved collaboration, which is huge for us. The company\u2019s intelligence is in the brains of its employees, and in a complex business you need all of those different perspectives. The modern world is full of experts in micro-domains. If we are to reimagine the Jaguar Land Rover business, and the automotive sector, we need to create this new data-first mindset.  We want to use Tableau to democratise data and analytics. Rather than confine data analytics to a central, corporate data analytics team, the goal is to give as many people as possible the skills, tools, and confidence to explore and analyse their own data. Today, Jaguar Land Rover has more than 1,300 employees actively creating dashboards and analyses, and more than 5,000 exploring this data and finding insights for themselves.  We created an Analytics Centre of Excellence in 2017, and between 2017 and 2020 we delivered more \u00a3200 million in value to the business from more data-driven decisions. Tableau was used on all this work as the primary tool for exploring data and sharing insights.  In 2021 we stepped this up a gear as we formed and grew a digital centre of excellence, called InDigital, by merging and expanding our Intelligent Automation and Data Analytics centres. The new combined team targets \u00a3250 million of business value per year from digital and data.  We were in a cycle where Tableau would increase in popularity, demand and usage would go up, and we would hit server capacity. That was restraining us. Switching to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with Tableau Cloud removes that restriction. It provides us with\u202funlimited scale for data analysis, with employees able to explore and analyse their data securely from anywhere.  Very much so. The numbers of employees exploring data is consistently increasing. What is pleasing is that content is being created across every function of the business. For instance, right now the most active areas of the business interacting with their data include retail business planning, quality management for new part designs, and just-in-time manufacturing. \n \nThe impact is being felt across the business. Thanks to our self-service model, data-driven decisions are helping smooth issues in the supply chain and reduce discounts on dealer forecourts. \n \nThe beauty of Tableau is its ease of use. The more people we can get using data in their work the better, but for this to happen, to move away from Excel, you need to make data accessible and trusted and the new tools and platforms easy to use. It\u2019s so easy to find and action insights with Tableau. \n \nMy role is about making as easy as possible for people to generate value from data and collaborate around data.  As an example of how we do this, we\u2019d found dashboards created in Tableau tended to be shared and used by people the creator knew in their function \u2013 HR with HR, engineering with engineering. This is understandable, it isn\u2019t their role to identify every user across Jaguar Land Rover that can benefit from their work. But by creating a new framework and changing the permissions and policies we\u2019ve made it safe and easy for employees to share insights more widely. The impact of a policy driven security model was almost immediate, within a month the server logs showed a significant increase in cross-organisation collaboration, which is so critical to innovation and business performance.  There are 21,000 laptop users in Jaguar Land Rover; or, 21,000 possible data analysts. The goal is to get them all excited about the potential of a data-driven culture and to get them using Tableau. In fact, I\u2019d like non-connected employees, from production line to logistics, to be included too. Data-driven decisions will enhance all areas of our business. \n \nWe have a long way to go, but we have reached a tipping point. Our sponsors are always asking how we can build even more excitement around data and agree that Tableau is now the standard platform that everyone should have access to. \n \nEveryone benefits from being data-driven. It creates momentum, it encourages innovation, and drives continual improvement \u2013 both from a personal and business perspective. \n \nTableau will be a strategic partner to accelerate our Digital transformation. We have recently entered a new agreement that gives us 20,000 Tableau licenses including 5,000 Creators for Jaguar Land Rover employees and an additional 11,000 licenses for our Retailer network. With the right training, support and community activities in place, everyone will be able to be part of our data driven culture. "

        "company": "Mizuho Bank",
        "content": "Mizuho Bank,Ltd. provides banking services and other financial services primarily to individuals, SMEs, large corporations, financial and public sectors, and both Japanese and non-Japanese companies overseas. The Global Transaction Banking Dept. Business Development & Risk Management Team is responsible for planning Mizuho's transaction banking business worldwide. \u201dFor Global Transaction Banking Sales, before proposing a solution to a customer, we need to thoroughly understand the customer\u2019s cash flow situation by looking at the amount of funds being transferred globally across the entirety of Mizuho Bank as well as visualizing Mizuho Bank's transaction data for each customer,\u201d says Yoshisuke Maeda, Managing Director of the Business Development & Risk Management Team. He claims that there is a massive amount of data to be analyzed for that purpose, and it is not uncommon for the amount of data to exceed millions of units per month. \u201dIn the past, we would download data in CSV format from several servers and import it into a database product for analysis,\u201d says Shiori Muramatsu, Vice President of the Business Development & Risk Management Team. She reflected that highly time-consuming data aggregation work would be performed dozens of times every month. \u201cMoreover, there was a limitation on the volume of data we could handle at one time, and depending on the objective of the report, we had to do some aggregation in advance to avoid exceeding that limitation.\u201d Feeling they were being held back by this, Muramatsu chose Tableau as a way to resolve their issues. They first began using Tableau Desktop in April 2018. To spread the benefits throughout the entire organization, she created proposals for projects and presented them to Maeda. Reflecting on that time, Maeda said, \u201cI was impressed not only by the content of the presentations, but also by how strongly she felt about it\u201d. \u201cAt the time, we were actually considering ways to enhance our competitiveness in the Asia region. I determined Muramatsu\u2019s proposal would be a big contribution to those efforts, so I decided to give a greenlight for the launch of the project.\u201d The project was officially approved in October 2019. Muramatsu worked to push the project forward together with Nobuko Izuma, who is also Vice President of the Business Development & Risk Management Team. In July 2020, Ahra Ko joined the team as a key member. In August 2020, the first production release was carried out to provide planning analysis functionality for Tokyo headquarters. Izuma explains the system configuration as follows.\n\n\u201cWe used AWS because of an umbrella agreement with our IT Department, and we built an environment that could run Tableau Desktop, Prep, and Tableau Server. For ETL (Extract/Transform/Load), we outsource data that is important or needs complex processing, and other data is processed by users using Tableau Prep.\u201d In addition to building this environment, we also actively conducted an internal promotion to increase the number of users within the bank. \u201cNot only did we want to educate users, we wanted to make the whole organization data driven. We added our own elements to the Tableau Blueprint, which was introduced by the Tableau Customer Success Team, and created a roadmap,\u201d says Muramatsu. \u201cBased on this roadmap, we are working to find personnel capable of using Tableau in advance, both in Japan and overseas, and we have personnel take official training programs hosted by Tableau, amongst other initiatives.\u201d This contributed to promote understanding of Tableau, not only within the department but amongst personnel in a wide range of relevant departments, and increased the number of Tableau users to around 300. Fifteen people have already participated in the training session held for talent discovery purposes. So why did Muramatsu choose Tableau for a data analysis platform? Muramatsu gives three main reasons. First of all, Tableau can produce high-level visual representations of cash flow data, which contain a high volume of data for each record and are difficult to handle. \u201cIn order to understand cash flow status, it is necessary to use dynamic visualizations that enable you to drill down from aggregate data to check on specific details, then return back to aggregate data again. With Tableau, this can be accomplished with a single click of the mouse. For example, you can show the movement of funds for specific regions on a map.\u201d Secondly, Tableau has a data update alert feature. By sending a notification email to users right when data is updated, \u201cClient data will go directly to the user, who is in charge of the sales,\u201d says Muramatsu, describing how Tableau makes it easier to utilize data. Finally, Tableau can be used for agile development that responds to ever-changing user needs. \u201cI am in charge of developing and improving dashboards based on user requests,\u201d says Ahra Ko. \u201cI can immediately have users see the dashboard I create and have total control to change it on the spot, enabling me to quickly respond to user feedback.\u201d The Business Development & Risk Management Team has already created over 100 dashboards, and some of those are improved and updated every day. By implementing Tableau on the company platform as a business intelligence (BI) tool, the Global Transaction Banking Dept. has seen the following benefits. 1. Agile Development and Cost Reduction Through Insourcing By insourcing most dashboard creation, we have reduced costs for work that was previously outsourced. Development speed has also increased dramatically. After training and some hands-on experience, we think even non-IT personnel can develop their own dashboards. 2. Faster Decision-making via DX Over 100 dashboards have been created in the year after implementation, and 80% of those were for information that could not previously be visualized. It is also possible to conduct analysis that goes back and forth between macro and micro perspectives, which means both planning and sales are able to use Tableau to help them make decisions quickly. 3. Taking work styles and customer solutions to the next level through an enhanced data-driven approach Whereas previously data analysis required months, high-quality analysis can now be done at incredible speeds in days or weeks. The alert feature prompts Sales to take their action, making it easier to bring up customer data in Tableau to find an opening for a sales pitch before a customer visit, amongst other things. These initiatives are viewed highly throughout the entire Mizuho Group. Yuichi Hirano, Assistant to the Director in the Security & Data Management Dept. at Mizuho Financial Group, gave the following comments. \u201cI view the use of Tableau in the Global Transaction Banking Dept. as a good example of a tool\u2019s advantages fitting well with the needs of the bank\u2019s business arm. In our department, we provide support for data-related problem-solving and develop frameworks to support the implementation of business policy at Mizuho. Through initiatives like this, we hope to provide the support that the business arm needs to utilize the tools best suited to its objectives.\u201d The plan for 2021 and beyond is to enable more overseas offices to use Tableau and add sales support functionality. \u201cOur goal is to promote global cooperation,\u201d says Muramatsu. \u201cUltimately, we would like to create a shared platform that can be used to view the same data all over the world.\u201d"

        "title": "Yves Rocher boosts its international sales teams\u2019 performance with Tableau",
        "company": "Yves Rocher",
        "content": "The Rocher Group is a French family-owned group founded in 1959 by Yves Rocher; it operates in around 100 countries. The Yves Rocher cosmetics brand currently has 30 million customers and 3,000 stores worldwide. Yves Rocher markets its products through four distribution networks: Retail and Business Development, mail order, e-commerce, and direct sales. Customer data are of strategic importance in managing the business. Since the beginning, the Brand has been a pioneer in customer relations, in terms of both its many sales outlets and its mail order sales. Emilie Latimier, Global Business Analyst Manager at Yves Rocher, tells us more about how Yves Rocher has capitalized on Tableau to innovate, from optimizing cross-functional team collaboration to improving its sales teams\u2019 performance. Prior to Tableau being implemented, each of our subsidiaries had its own monthly sales reporting tool per channel and its own methods of calculating sales. With a structure like this, a market manager in charge of 10 countries might receive up to 40 monthly sales reports, all in different formats (1 report per sales channel for each subsidiary). Comparing the data was difficult, if not impossible. This is why the company decided to implement a structure and a tool that would provide consistent data in order to deploy its sales performance management policy. Being aware of the strategic value of data, the Group wanted to create a data-driven culture. So we decided to work on standardizing the data and KPIs, to better understand sales trends. To achieve this, we decided to adopt a common definition and common formulas of indicators for all the subsidiaries. However, at the end of this stage, the market managers continued to receive dozens of pdf files and Excel tables containing information that was still difficult to read and use. We really needed a tool that would allow us to compile the data in an intelligible and visual way. After researching the market, we chose Tableau and decided to deploy the solution at the Yves Rocher Brand level. We worked on an initial retail use case by creating a dashboard for managing sales in retail chains and in-store productivity. To achieve this, we set up a cross-functional team comprising staff responsible for monitoring the performance of the points of sale and of the CRM. By grouping together this user population, our objective was to configure the solution to meet the information needs of each business. Technically, we linked the Tableau solution to our database. These data are automatically retrieved by the solution each month and displayed in the reporting dashboards. The solution was deployed in the Customer Experience, Controlling, and Marketing departments. The Tableau solution was enthusiastically received and quickly adopted. And for good reason: Staff members have gone from black and white pdf reports that are difficult to use to automatic, visual dashboards that are easy to manipulate. We were so excited by the Tableau solution that we wanted to roll it out across the entire company right away. But it was better to proceed one step at a time. For the solution to be adopted by all users, it is essential that it is deployed gradually so as not to lose the user. By using Dataviz, users can visualize sales trends immediately. They are able to choose specific filter levels according to their needs, whether they are analyzing monthly or quarterly direct sales. Tableau is an agile and flexible solution that saves time and gives teams autonomy. Information can be searched by channel, geographic region, turnover, number of till receipts, shopping cart averages, traffic, conversion rate, etc. This view enables them to quickly identify business risks and opportunities, and to implement more relevant actions, making them more agile. Moreover, in an omnichannel sales model, Tableau is a collaborative solution that supports the breakdown of information. On the one hand, by making the data available to all staff members, with the same level of information for everyone. And on the other hand, by allowing operations managers in retail, direct sales, mail order, and e-commerce to quickly visualize all reports, regardless of the sales channel. This exchange of information generates contacts between the sales channels and creates collective intelligence for managing business performance. In a year and a half we have gone from 1 to 20 use cases, covering retail, product performance management, pricing strategy, monitoring of e-commerce sites and social selling, as well as CRM performance. We have increased the skills of our business analysts in creating dashboards through training and coaching in order to develop our Tableau reporting tools internally. We have also deployed the solution in all of the brand\u2019s central functions and set up internal training courses to promote the development of a true self-service data culture, in particular by giving the business teams more autonomy. Tableau has become the analysis tool of the Yves Rocher brand with 200 active users. Our priority is to focus on consolidating what has been achieved over the last 12 months and to make the various populations and new entrants think instinctively of using Tableau. We want to go further through a training program to make all departments professional in understanding data, so that every decision is taken based on the data of the ecosystem. In addition, we are entering a new phase with the deployment of our omnichannel monitoring project in our subsidiaries. Tableau will enable operational management of business performance on a daily basis. The challenge is to provide greater granularity and more precise KPIs in order to react to data on a daily basis and thus to become more reactive and agile. We started this project on the French market, with the aim of extending it to other countries over the next few years."

        "title": "Tableau Used to Manage FUJIFILM Print & Gifts",
        "company": "Fujifilm Imaging Systems",
        "content": "Background to Implementation\n\nEstablishment of Cross-product data infrastructure grabs attention In the transition from film to digital media, the way we take photos and enjoy them has changed dramatically. However, there still remain many who want photos printed on paper or a paper album they can use to reflect on their memories with enjoyment. To serve these needs, FUJIFILM Corporation (hereinafter FUJIFILM) introduced FUJIFILM Prints & Gifts, which enables users to easily place orders for various print services with their smartphones. \u201cWe already had a service in place that enabled users to easily order prints online, since this was set up in 1998,\u201d says Masanori Todo of FUJIFILM Imaging Systems Co., Ltd, which is involved in the planning and operation of this service. At FUJIFILM Imaging Systems Co., Ltd, Todo is a manager in the No. 2 Special Sales Department of the Regional Volume Sales and Special Sales Division at Consumer Sales HQ. He explains that they rebranded the existing service in July 2018, and that this service is a more convenient version of the previous one. \u201cWe also provide a membership-based shopping service for consumers called FUJIFILM Mall, and members of that service can make use of FUJIFILM Prints & Gifts.\u201d In marketing for e-commerce sites like this, using data to monitor user trends is essential. Although they had long collected and used various data for that purpose, they \u201cjust couldn\u2019t seem to find a use that met their needs,\u201d reflects Yusuke Sato, who is also a manager in the No. 2 Special Sales Department alongside Todo. \u201cThis service is a sort of portal site, and different staff are responsible for different products. As a result, staff would have different perspectives on how to use tools and data, which tended to introduce noise into the process. With this sort of dynamic, it wasn\u2019t possible to put together precise policies that take a broader perspective on the service as a whole. We felt that we needed a data infrastructure that cut across all products.\u201d   Tableau Implementation and Operation\n\nCentralizing Data in Cloud Storage and Analyzing with Tableau They chose Tableau as the tool to build that data infrastructure. \u201dI previously worked at FUJIFILM head offices in their Digital Marketing Strategy (\u201cDM-Sen\u201d) department, and that\u2019s where I was when we began using Tableau in 2016,\u201d says Todo. The reason they adopted Tableau was that the manager of the Fujifilm Way Office, which promotes DX across FUJIFILM as a whole, had recommended \u201cusing Tableau to utilize data in marketing for consumer-oriented services.\u201d \u201cWe had been using pivot tables in Excel to conduct data analysis, but this didn\u2019t enable us to visualize the data to our satisfaction. So we took up the manager\u2019s suggestion and decided to use Tableau.\u201d A variety of data is used in the management of FUJIFILM Prints & Gifts, including incoming order data, sales data, customer information, and Google Analytics data. This data is first consolidated on the cloud for storage, and then it is made accessible to Tableau users via Tableau Bridge. Moreover, the cloud storage is also linked up with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, so this consolidated data is also used on the marketing cloud and to provide data feedback for MA measures. Naturally, this type of data can also be analyzed using Tableau. Why Tableau?\n\nEasy Visualization and Not Dependent on Individuals\u2019 Skillsets Todo explained why they decided to use Tableau as follows. \u201cWe decided to use Tableau because it can both analyze and visualize data. Through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, you can immediately view the data you want from any angle. It is also easy to combine multiple types of data for visualization without any errors. Excel always requires some manual labor, and you need to verify whether tables created by combining multiple types of data are actually correct or not. With Tableau, none of that work is necessary.\u201d In addition to this, \u201ccrucially, Tableau is not dependent on any individual staff member\u2019s skillset,\u201d says Sato. \u201cMany marketing and creative staff lack Excel skills, and it\u2019s not uncommon for them to misinterpret the data, either. However, if you prepare a dashboard in Tableau, anyone can analyze the data from the same perspective. The marketing staff responsible for each type of product can take it upon themselves to conduct a cross-sectional analysis that includes other products.\u201d Benefits of Tableau Implementation\n\nMore Precise Policies and Faster Decision-making Implementing Tableau has the following benefits: Speeding Up Data Utilization In the past, they would export various data in CSV format and import that into Excel for aggregation. But this work was time-consuming, and aggregation was performed once per month, explains Todo. With Tableau, however, aggregation is instantaneous and is now performed on a daily basis. High-precision Policy Development \u201cIn the past, decisions were made based on different data for each product. That made it difficult to draw on experience with other products, so we had trouble improving the precision of our measures and policies,\u201d said Sato. Since they started using Tableau, all marketing staff have been able to use data from the same perspective, and he said this makes it easier to create policies that draw on past experiences. \u201cAlso, when we are looking at the effectiveness of a campaign, there is now a consistency to how we look at the data. This makes it easier to evaluate over a longer span of six months to a year. We have now created many policies that are based on data.\u201d As marketing staff get access to more data and are able to utilize it more quickly, this has ripple effects on adjacent departments such as those handling digital advertising data, as those departments have more material to study and are able to work more swiftly. Speedy Meetings and Decision-making There have also been major changes to how policy planning and evaluation meetings are conducted. Although we previously held discussions at meetings based on paper materials, it is now standard to use Tableau screens and wrap meetings up in a short amount of time. \u201cIncreasingly, meetings can be completed just by sitting next to someone and glancing over Tableau. We don\u2019t even need to reserve a conference room. Even when working remotely, all we have to do is share a Tableau screen and decisions can be made without issue,\u201d says Sato. Future Developments\n\nUtilizing Web Ad Data and Linking Up with the Marketing Cloud \u201cGoing forward, we will import web ad data in order to analyze it on Tableau,\u201d says Sato. He explained that this is because the more data there is, the wider the range of policies that can be formulated, and this will further improve the precision of those policies. \u201cFUJIFILM Business Expert Corporation, our in-house advertising agency, has already been using Salesforce Datorama. We are currently preparing to link up our systems.\u201d Meanwhile, Todo explains, they are also looking at using the results of Tableau analysis on the Marketing Cloud. \u201cWe currently export the results of segment analysis conducted in Tableau as CSV files and import those into the Marketing Cloud, but we would like to automate this process.\u201d"

        "title": "Using Tableau to Visualize Massive Data in Smart Factories",
        "company": "Kioxia Iwate Corporation",
        "content": "Background to Implementation The Essence of Semiconductor Manufacturing is Rapid Response to Unforeseen Circumstances First inventing NAND flash memory in 1987, then establishing 3D flash memory technology in 2007, KIOXIA Group continues to be a global leader in the semiconductor memory industry. Within KIOXIA Group, the KIOXIA Iwate Corporation (\u201cKIOXIA Iwate\u201d) has implemented the largest manufacturing building and most advanced facilities, and it is responsible for production of BiCS FLASH\u2122 3D flash memory. \u201cSince semiconductor development and manufacturing test the physical limits of the process, they are different from other types of manufacturing and are similar to agriculture, in a sense,\u201d said KIOXIA Iwate President and CEO Koichiro Shibayama. He explains that, when pushed to the physical limits, unexpected events are more likely to occur and it is not uncommon for things to deviate from the plan. \u201cThe essence of this industry is actually dealing with these unexpected events in itself. This is what makes it so hard for other companies to enter the industry.\u201d To enable this, it is essential to rapidly gather massive amounts of data generated at factories and make quick management decisions with respect to circumstances that are changing day by day. For that reason, KIOXIA Iwate is working to transform its plants into smart factories, and these factories generate billions of units of data on a daily basis, Shibayama explains. \u201cFor example, if manufacturing equipment breaks down, we have to quickly determine what kind of specialist to call and what parts to replace. Semiconductor supplies, which are already strained, may be delayed if these decisions come too late. Of course, manual processing of this incoming data will never get it ready in time. Instead, we need a way to instantly see the data with one click and use it in our decision-making right then and there.\u201d Tableau Implementation and Operation One Year After Implementation, Half of Personnel are Tableau Users What should we do to address these needs? The answer that KIOXIA Iwate drew to this conclusion: Tableau. \u201cWe started developing a plan to create a venue for sharing information in May 2020, but we didn\u2019t have a specific tool in mind at first,\u201d said Naoyuki Ando, General Manager of the IT Promotion Department at KIOXIA Iwate. They started out by having outside consultants come in to teach them the tools and state of affairs. \u201cThen we had them suggest three types of products, and in July 2020 we decided to use Tableau.\u201d The IT Promotion Department had never used Tableau before, so they began by mastering the tool through training provided by Tableau Software, Inc. Tableau Software, Inc. was also asked to handle data collection and other environment-building, and implementation took place between summer and fall 2020. Next, we began working on visualizing manufacturing data. Budget control was implemented for daily manufacturing activities, and data on equipment problems was shared. In April 2021, we began operating dashboards for quality control (e.g. yield rates) and dashboards for manufacturing management that import data from production planning systems. In August 2021, manufacturing-related dashboards were expanded further. \u201cStarting with around ten users initially, we now have approximately 500 people using Tableau, which is half of our company\u2019s total workforce,\u201d explains Sho Hironai, IT Promotion Lead in the IT Promotion Department of KIOXIA Iwate. \u201cUltimately, we want to expand Tableau to all personnel except frontline workers.\u201d Why Tableau? Praise for Intuitive Controls, Support, and Easy Rollout So why was Tableau chosen from among the three products considered? Hironai gives three general reasons. First is that Tableau\u2019s controls are intuitive, and Prep can be used to flexibly link up to various data sources. \u201cSince there is a high volume of data involved, we especially appreciated how easy it is to filter data. Drill down and other features can also be used more flexibly than with other BI products.\u201d Second, Tableau provides a robust amount of data and strong support structure. If users have any questions, he says, they can look up many of the answers on the internet. If they still can\u2019t resolve the issue, they can contact Tableau Software, Inc. directly. To make further use of these advantages, the company also signed up for Premium Support in November 2021 when they achieved 500 Tableau users. Third is just how easy it is to roll out. \u201cI have been using Tableau since the summer of my first year with the company. Although I had no experience with the program, I was able to create a dashboard after about two weeks,\u201d said Shiona Yaegashi, IT Promotion staff in the IT Promotion Department of KIOXIA Iwate. If the user has received some simple training in advance, she says, almost nothing in Tableau should be difficult, and using the software should be fun. Benefits of Tableau Implementation Faster Creation of Reference Materials and Quicker Decision-making Using Tableau in smart factories has yielded the following benefits. Reports Created in Less Time \u201cAlthough there was already a system in place for collecting data from manufacturing plants in real time, Excel was used to aggregate this data and create daily reports,\u201d explains Hironai. He reflects on how this process wasted two to three hours every day. \u201cMost of that work is now no longer needed. We have cut down the time spent on creating reports by 78%.\u201d Improving the Accuracy and Speed of Decision-making There has been an improvement in the speed of decision-making when a problem occurs on-site. Previously, dozens of relevant personnel needed to come together based on the reference materials created, but now they can simply look at the dashboard, have a discussion, and make a decision without meeting. Moreover, since everyone is looking at the same data, discussions will be more precise and to the point. The amount of time required to address a given issue is somewhere between half and a third of what it was before, although this varies from case to case. Cultivating a Data-driven Culture Using Tableau on an everyday basis is also changing the mindset of personnel. \u201cMore personnel are beginning their days by checking the status of things on their dashboard before beginning their daily work,\u201d Ando explains. He adds that personnel are also showing interest in dashboards outside the manufacturing department. Some members of the accounting department have begun using dashboards. \u201cThere has also been talk of using the tools in areas such as electrical power usage analysis. Moving forward, I hope we can spread this company culture to other companies in the Group.\u201d Future Developments Capture a Wider Range of Data to Support the Independent Growth of Personnel Although Tableau is currently used to visualize equipment data in factories, Shibayama says he would like to import more infrastructure data and data needed for decision-making at large plants such as chemical plants and similar facilities as reference material for management decisions. In the future, he adds, he would also like to conduct discussions with partners and other external companies based on this data in order to make external business decisions. Meanwhile, he also says he expects Tableau to contribute greatly to creating an environment in which personnel can achieve independent growth. \u201cThere are many young staff at our company, but semiconductor manufacturing is a complex and difficult job in which many different matters are intertwined, making it difficult to master in a short period of time. Of course, we offer internal company training and the opportunity to be taught by more senior staff, but that will not be fast enough. However, with a system like Tableau, even staff who have yet to acquire the necessary skills have an easier time making proper decisions. I look forward to seeing this sort of system expanded further in the future.\u201d"

        "company": "BMW Group Asia",
        "content": "Founded in 1985, BMW Group Asia is the regional office overseeing 14 importer markets across East Asia and South Asia for both BMW and MINI brands. These stretch from New Caledonia and Tahiti in the East to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the West and Nepal in the North. It plays the role of a business incubator for these markets, introducing product and technology that best caters to customers\u2019 needs in this part of the world. To manage aftersales parts and services, customer retention, and customer satisfaction ratings across the entire dealer network in the region, BMW Group Asia needed a way to manage and extract insights from its data. Fernando Ferrer, Customer Support Director, BMW Group Asia, shared, \u201cHandling KPIs for one market is tough enough, but if you multiply that by 14, the complexity increases exponentially. We needed to find a data visualization tool to manage this information, and our business, more efficiently. After evaluating a variety of solutions, BMW Group Asia decided Tableau was the optimal solution and engaged Billigence to support the implementation. Asked about the business impact of Tableau, Ferrer said, \"Tableau plays an essential role in helping us drive performance, and I'm happy to say our business is now approaching pre-pandemic levels.\" BMW Group Asia's Customer Support team alone handles an extensive amount of data, for everything from parts and labor, to warranties and technical support. It wanted to consolidate the data into simplified dashboards to make it easier to analyze. Billigence, a Tableau partner and business intelligence consultancy, was brought in to bring these dashboards to life and help the business extract deeper insights from the data. The consultants from Billigence worked closely with BMW Group Asia to understand the business's pain points and visualize its data in the most useful way. One of the barriers to adoption was the team's reliance on existing spreadsheets. To overcome this, Ferrer led from the front and switched to reviewing all performance data in Tableau. Multiple training sessions and enablement workshops were held to broaden the team's knowledge of data literacy and the Tableau platform. In addition, internal meetings were held to break down data silos within the business and agree on definitions of metrics to be tracked. Currently all area managers within BMW Group Asia's customer support team use Tableau, and other departments are exploring using Tableau as well. Tableau acts as their single source of truth and also has automated reporting, leading to cost and time savings. \"We still have spreadsheets and other sources of data as backup, but we primarily use Tableau to steer the business,\" said Ferrer. \"It gives us granular insights into our data that help us adapt and address issues quickly.\" One visualization BMW Group Asia has is the customer retention dashboard. It allows the department to track which customers are most loyal and identify segments that it needs to take action to retain.  Another key dashboard tracks BMW Group Asia's Net Promoter Score (NPS) in each market, helping the business react faster to customer feedback and take necessary actions to improve its processes or services.  These and other visualizations created during the pandemic helped compensate for the fact that area managers were unable to travel and access the usual intelligence gained from dealer visits.  \"We rely on this data to manage our business, and in the past, it was all scattered in different databases,\" said Ferrer. \"Tableau helped us bring all our KPIs and metrics into one place so we could review performance online. It was difficult at first, but everyone quickly adjusted to the new normal, and, with Tableau and other digital tools implemented during that time, we've brought the business back to where it was before the pandemic.\" Next, BMW Group Asia plans to create external-facing dashboards for dealers. This will improve collaboration between BMW Group Asia and dealers and ultimately allow for better customer relationship management.  "

        "company": "Seattle Seahawks",
        "content": "The Seattle Seahawks, Super Bowl XLVIII champions and three-time NFC champions, are an iconic part of Washington state sports. In fact, on game day, Lumen Field is the size of a small city, with more than 67,000 people in the stands. Their fans, lovingly known as \u201cthe 12s,\u201d are some of the most passionate fans in the NFL\u2013setting crowd noise records that register on regional seismometers. But the Seahawks are just as committed to their fans, using data to create winning experiences on and off the field.  Data Culture isn\u2019t a stretch goal for the Seattle Seahawks, it\u2019s deeply woven into everything they do, starting with Seahawks President Chuck Arnold, whose motto is \u201cWe can measure everything, and we should. What isn\u2019t measured isn\u2019t managed.\u201d The entire organization is on an unwavering mission to find opportunities in Tableau that improve and innovate the fan experience and empower teams to take action on insights\u2014scoring points with customers and fueling a data-driven culture for the long haul.  But it wasn\u2019t always this way. Though fan feedback has always been a top priority for the Seahawks, for many years, business operations had difficulties organizing and processing the data from surveys and other sources to glean timely, actionable insights. Overflowing spreadsheets, multiple data sources, and other data roadblocks got in the way, and it wasn\u2019t getting any better.  But like sports, timing is everything. Though the Seahawks were using Tableau Cloud for simple dashboards, it sat on the data sidelines. But when a data analyst created a stadium suite visualizer in Tableau to track suite revenue, it was a game-changer. \u201cRight away the dashboard showed the power of Tableau,\u201d said Jeff Dunn, Vice President of Business Strategy & Analytics. \u201cSuddenly, we see this great visual that was much more user friendly than the customized version we purchased from a consultant.\u201d Dunn also noted that it\u2019s easy to develop or tweak dashboards on a desktop or phone anytime, anywhere. This was also critical in a stadium environment where movement is a constant. \u201cOne of our primary objectives is to have the best fan experience in all of sports,\u201d said Jeff Dunn. \u201cThere are so many inputs we can analyze to improve that experience, so we need to make sure we\u2019re collecting all those data points and making them actionable to make decisions based on data.\u201d That positive experience was the turning point to create a formal data analytics group, putting the right people and tools in place, with Tableau Cloud as the foundation. \u201cTableau allowed us to have a fully-hosted environment, and we didn\u2019t have to manage everything on our small team. We couldn\u2019t have done it without that help,\u201d Paimon Jaberi, Director of Business Strategy and Analytics, said. He pointed out that the Tableau learning curve flattened with an active, robust online Tableau community, technical support, and resources that made all the difference for easier adoption.  With Tableau on board, the Seahawks took the first step on their data journey. The collective team then focused on the \u201chow\u201d for implementing this new program. \u201cWe looked at what do we want to measure? How do we want to establish success? What are the metrics we're going to look at for our teammates to put in the data that we can measure and see results,\u201d Amy Sprangers, Chief Revenue Officer, said. Once these processes and benchmarks were developed, Tableau was transitioned into an integral, daily part of the Seahawks\u2019 20 lines of business and functions\u2014from the stadium operations staff to the C-suite. One of the larger data initiatives was game day stadium operations, which plotted their fans\u2019 every move to make improvements every step of the way: entrance and exit procedures, parking, walking through the security concourses, food and beverage, Wi-Fi, entertainment, and other aspects of the attendee experience. Data insights would also be used for ticketing, sales, customer service, suite sales, premium seating, corporate partnerships, and sponsors. It was a dizzying array of dashboards, but the Seahawks were 100% committed to all the stories the data told. With the Seahawks fan experience as job #1, data was leveraged whenever and wherever it could be. One of the most visible and key areas was the NFL Voice of the Fan survey. \u201cThose are super important to us. When people are telling you about their experience, that's incredibly valuable and we take that to heart that they\u2019re taking the time to let us know,\u201d Jaberi said.  One of the consistent pieces of survey feedback for years was difficulty hearing in some of the stadium seats during the games, but they couldn\u2019t pinpoint which seats or the source of the problem. Jaberi said, \u201cOur fans were providing us this great data that we could do something with, but we didn't have that culture or the tools before Tableau.\u201d  When they used a Tableau Heat Map to input the data, the four corners of stadium lit up in red. With these locations identified, they could act on the problem, adjusting speakers in those seating areas. \u201cIt was an immediate example of how we could take that data and use in the right way. It was a very efficient way to solve a fan problem and make that experience better for them,\u201d Sprangers added. The team also relied on Tableau Heat Maps for other data-driven insights to improve the fan experience. Another identified issue was slow exiting out of the northeast side of the stadium. The data showed that the pinch point was a railroad east of the stadium, restricting the ability to get out of that side of the stadium quickly. \u201cWith this data, it gave us more power to make a change, invest capital and resources, because we had hard data to back that decision,\u201d Dunn said.  This attention to fan feedback has also resulted in subtle improvements that matter to fans\u2014like moving a craft beer kiosk from one location to another based on preferences shown at different stadium locations.  Fans also love the Seahawks back no matter what. Even without fans in attendance at games during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Seahawks continued a connection with their fans, maintaining their ranking as one of the top-rated teams for the fan experience.  The Seahawks also fully exploit the visual aspects of Tableau. For instance, their ticketing sales dashboard is visualized as Lumen Field\u2019s seat map, which, as Jaberi pointed out, makes the data much more engaging for stakeholders, especially those in a non-traditional data role, like an executive, stadium worker, or sales.  Tableau\u2019s impact is also seen in how the data analytics team assesses new business tools and systems. As Jaberi put it, \u201cAfter being exposed to how robust and how great the Tableau community is, it\u2019s the gold standard when we\u2019re evaluating products and platforms.\u201d He said asking question about how active the online community is, how comprehensive the resources are to learn the product or troubleshoot, and other markers are key in gauging a new product\u2019s worthiness.  In addition to the fan experience, the Seahawks integrate Tableau into other areas of the business\u2014from gathering insights for closing new corporate partner contracts to retooling its revenue models. The Seahawks also conduct data-driven work for their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs and developed a community relations dashboard. \u201cIt's become important and powerful that we proudly show ownership to highlight our impact,\u201d Sprangers said. Bringing on Tableau as an essential part of Seahawks business strategy was a big undertaking and required a game plan to increase and amplify Data Culture\u2014but it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Here are the key plays that contributed to a robust Data Culture: Cultivating data champions. With everyone using Tableau from the top down, group leaders are natural data champions and show how dashboards help them operate their department in a better way\u2014whether it\u2019s efficiency, cost-savings, and other metrics. \u201cBecause you can see the power quickly in a visual way, it helps get people on teams to embrace Tableau. Once they start building dashboards they want to dive deeper with new ones,\u201d Dunn said.  Celebrating wins. Using data insights isn\u2019t just about the endgame, it\u2019s also about championing everyone\u2019s work when a team hits their goals. Sprangers pointed out, \u201cRecognizing achievements has been a huge key to our success, our growth as an organization, and being data-driven.\u201d When a goal is achieved, it\u2019s highlighted in the dashboard and amplified through widely-shared celebration emails and team acknowledgements. Developing community. Tableau Cloud also became the catalyst for collaboration through its widespread use with the Seahawks. Teams went from working in silos to working together much more often. Because data across the organization is open and transparent, dashboards can be shared out and customized for other teams, and best practices exchanged in their online community.   Optimizing Tableau usage. All employees are trained to ensure data goes into Tableau Cloud consistently so that a suite sale, fan interaction, community event, or other activity is surfaced correctly in dashboard reporting. \u201cTableau offers some great ways to use hyperlinks to connect different dashboards, and it\u2019s easy to point and dive deeper with click-throughs and drill downs to drive meetings and our insights,\u201d Jaberi said. The Seahawks have embraced data culture with Tableau dashboards as the catalyst. As the team strives to deliver the best fan experience, work towards positive social change, and be a community leader, Tableau will continue to be an integral part of the team.  Sprangers said, \u201cI think about how we've used data as a journey, how far we've come, and how successfully it's been adopted all the way through the organization to be a data-driven organization. We're excited to become even more innovative in the future.\u201d"

        "company": "Yorkshire Building Society",
        "content": "Yorkshire Building Society is bucking the trend. As competitors increasingly turn their back on retail branches in favour of digital channels, this leading society is investing in a hybrid physical and digital model to deliver a differentiated and rewarding customer experience.  Tableau Cloud provides the \u2018purposeful analytics\u2019 to power this strategy. Branch and area managers use the agile visual analytics to explore every facet of branch performance. With everyone now sharing one common dashboard view of branch performance, the Society\u2019s Director of Retail Distribution believes the organisation is experiencing, \u201cthe highest rate of customer retention we have ever seen.\u201d Yorkshire Building Society is one of the UK\u2019s largest and most successful building societies with more than 230 branches and local agencies across the country. The Society has more than \u00a345 billion in assets and employs 3,000 people.  The Society believes wholeheartedly in the future of face-to-face service. Indeed, it has more outlets than most comparably sized competitors. Over the longer term, the Society will also look to expand its network into new towns and cities where there is customer demand but where the Society currently has no presence. However, a branch infrastructure comes at a cost. Yorkshire Building Society needs timely, accurate and complete intelligence to ensure every branch is operating efficiently, offering the financial services customers need, and delivering an optimal customer experience.  Until recently however, those data insights were locked away in separate, fragmented systems and processes, making it harder for people to make agile, trusted decisions. Jonathan Wager, BIS Insight Manager explains, \u201cWe had a \u2018cottage industry\u2019 of different business intelligence solutions, which resulted in multiple versions of the truth. Our aim was to support \u2018purposeful analytics\u2019 at the Society by using a single source of trusted data and the power of interactive data visualization to make strategic branch decisions.\u201d This is where Tableau comes in. Yorkshire Building Society standardised on the Tableau visual analytics platform, with branch managers, retail managers and area managers all now connected to the same, shared, single view of data. It empowers users to ask and answer their own questions and helps users gain deep insights without compromising speed. Jonathan again: \u201cBefore Tableau, branch managers were somewhat \u2018in the dark\u2019 about branch performance. They were several steps removed from the data. Using self-service analytics, they have a visual representation of key KPIs and they can quickly monitor performance opportunities.\u201d This view is echoed by Gary Fowler, Director of Retail Distribution. \u201cIn the past, if you asked 100 managers how they were performing, you would get 100 different answers. Now we can see instantly how the business is performing. Tableau has sparked their curiosity in analytics. People are interested to know what\u2019s happening in each branch. Armed with these immediate insights, we are more agile and more informed as an organisation.\u201d Just as remarkably, the vast majority of users do not have \u2018data\u2019 in their job title. These are first and foremost financial services managers \u2013 not data scientists. \u201cTableau puts people first. It\u2019s intuitive, visual and immensely popular with the teams. That ease of use has changed people\u2019s relationship with data. A data culture is emerging, where every decision is based on evidence not intuition,\u201d says Jonathan. Tableau is the tool of choice for branch analytics. Dashboards underpin everything from branch insights, underwriting service delivery and product performance analysis, to customer service analysis, mortgage collections, and digital channel analysis. \u201cOur branch managers are light years ahead of where they were, in terms of how they use data,\u201d says Gary.   For example, a manager can review how customers are using the branch through the shared analytics providing informed insight into customer footfall, the type of enquiries, volume of financial transactions, and other processes, thereby determining how the branch can operate to ensure it provides optimal member value. Teams can also compare inter-branch performance. Jonathan explains, \u201cIf two branches have a similar profile, but one is outperforming the other, we can look at the outliers for that discrepancy. Do we need to adjust the product portfolio at the branch? Is more training needed? We are making data-driven decisions like these every day using Tableau.\u201d  A scatter-based comparative view also shows branch managers how they rank against other branches, on measures such as the number of new accounts opened or the average balance held per customer. According to Gary, \u201cThis purposeful analytics is a key enabler in helping the Society support a healthy, hybrid digital and physical infrastructure. We are experiencing the highest customer retention we have ever seen \u2013 and Tableau is instrumental in achieving high levels of customer satisfaction and retention.\u201d Yorkshire Building Society is different to a bank. With no shareholders to answer to, the focus is predominantly on members\u2019 needs. Every penny spent as a society is members\u2019 money \u2013 and Tableau is helping to ensure that money is spent wisely, optimising branch performance. Jonathan concludes, \u201cFor us, as a building society, it means delivering three central ambitions: helping people to have a place to call home and helping them towards greater financial wellbeing, whilst creating long-term value for our members.\u201d"

        "title": "Data drives McDonald\u2019s to a better customer experience",
        "company": "McDonald’s",
        "content": "This story is a condensed version of one produced by our partner, Inviso by Devoteam. The original can be viewed here. A core principle of the McDonald\u2019s customer experience is the ease and speed of ordering and receiving a meal. But for a restaurant with a menu of over 100 items, delivering on this promise requires that the entire restaurant runs like a well-oiled machine. Each employee must know their exact role, and every part of the process needs to run seamlessly, starting with the customer placing an order, the food being prepared, drinks poured, and the meal packed in tray or bag, before finally being delivered to the customer. Food Folk is the master franchisee for McDonalds\u2019 Nordic operations and as its Head of Finance, Jacob Hansen had a mission to help McDonald\u2019s Danish franchisees and Restaurant Managers to use their data to create an even better customer experience. The good news for Jacob was that McDonald\u2019s has been relatively good at collecting data from their thousands of daily customer interactions; now they just needed to find a way to present their data in an easy and accessible way - making the data come alive in the organization.\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst, we didn\u2019t have an effective way to share data,\u201d says Jacob. \u201cWe created manual reports in Excel that were sent by email. I knew that there must be a better way to do it, like creating dashboards with real-time data.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSecondly, we could use our data even better,\u201d he continues, \u201cThere was the potential to get an even better overview of the business and optimize it.\u201d The first step McDonald\u2019s and Inviso by Devoteam took together was building a collection of interactive dashboards in Tableau that covered what both used to be shown in the manual reports, as well as a host of new data that was previously unavailable. The reports contain a number of advantages for the company: An example of how data has helped McDonald\u2019s improve in the KPI called \u2018speed of service\u2019. This is a measure of the time it takes from when an order is registered, until the meal is delivered to the customer. Speed of service was one of the data points that was not possible to see before working with Inviso. Jacob explains: \u201cBefore we got the dashboards, the Restaurant Managers could not see \u2018what is great\u2019. Maybe they knew their own speed of service at a high level, but when they could not compare with other restaurants, it was of little worth to know.\u201d When they were able to access the new data in interactive dashboards, it gave a completely new opportunity to see how a single restaurant is performing in relation to the others on a specific point. Jacob continues: \u201cNow they can see how they are performing compared to the other restaurants. But what is even more important is that they can now click through the dashboards and find out why their speed of service is different than expected. Now they can easily zoom into e.g. the point of the day when service is not as fast as expected, or the time of the week when it happens. It means that they can now see when the problems start and launch solutions that are within their own circle of influence.\u201d The possibility to diagnose problems and pinpoint precisely when they originate has led to McDonald\u2019s restaurants throughout Denmark improving their average speed of service by 6% and increasing drive-through customers served per hour by 20% in 2020; impressive results in a year where restaurants\u2019 operations have fundamentally changed due to COVID-19. McDonald\u2019s has a strong performance culture. Among the employees there is a focus to always deliver service of the highest quality - and be the best at doing it. Therefore the introduction of these dashboards has fit in well with the company culture. At a few of the restaurants Jacob has visited, the dashboards have crossed from the digital to physical world, printed and hung up on the wall in the break room as motivation to be the top restaurant. \u201cThe dashboards have a strong motivation effect, there is no doubt about it,\u201d says Jacob. \u201cNow we act more on facts and less on gut feeling, and we can see that the whole organization has really taken to it, the dashboards have been viewed over 100.000 times already. We are just getting started working with data and creating transparency in our business. We have come a long way, but there are still so many ways we can go from here.\u201d Learn more about how Tableau has helped McDonald\u2019s create a better customer experience in this webinar."

        "title": "Predictive analytics help University of Utah Health optimize telehealth revenues and balance ICU capacity during COVID-19",
        "company": "University of Utah Health",
        "content": "Academic medical center University of Utah (U of U) Health, based in Salt Lake City, has five hospitals and twelve clinics serving communities across a six-state Mountain West region of the US, along with a thriving education and research practice. Like many health systems, it faced daunting operational and economic challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unpredictable rates and patterns of infection made it hard to plan for ICU and hospital bed capacity, while the shutdown of many on-site clinical services threatened to cause significant revenue loss. Faced with these challenges, U of U Health proactively pursued strategies driven by data visualization technology, and predictive analytics to find ways of providing the best care and patient outcomes while remaining solvent as a business. This effort amounted to a giant acceleration of the health system's digital transformation. \u201cWe really did about 5-10 years' worth of advancement in just a couple of months,\u201d said Charlton Park, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Analytics Officer at University of Utah Health. \u201cLike so many other clinics and institutions, the pandemic hit us hard, and there wasn't time to build a whole new practice from scratch\u2014we had to ramp up using the infrastructure we already had.\u201d In the case of replacing revenue and care opportunities potentially lost due to the shutdown, that meant taking U of U Health's nascent telehealth program from 800 or so monthly remote visits\u2014mostly urgent care sessions at the community clinics and pre-op/follow-up consulting for some specialty care\u2014to more than 11,000 telehealth visits per week across all locations at the pandemic's peak. Since reopening some services for in-person care, U of U Health has seen its telehealth model continue to thrive. \u201cOur clinicians and patients have truly embraced this remote method of interaction,\u201d said Park. \u201cEven today, our telehealth workload is around 5,000-6,000 visits weekly, and we expect it to stay at the level going forward.\u201d Analytics and Tableau visualizations played a big part in making this rapid ramp-up possible. Using data, U of U Health tracked the adoption of telehealth services across its practices and locations, identifying the specialties where it was most effective and allocating resources accordingly. At the same time, they tracked patient experience using survey feedback data and other outcomes to readily see where patients got the most benefit from telehealth and where their experience needed improvement. This represented a new learning curve for the organization during an already difficult time, and up-to-the-minute visualizations driven by relevant data were essential for keeping pace. Continuity of care during the pandemic was also the focus of other critical U of U Health initiatives involving visual analytics. Bed space was a high priority for COVID-19 patients, particularly in ICUs, but some of that space was also needed for other patients, such as those recovering from surgical procedures. To balance this capacity, they drew on a diverse set of data sources, including risk adjustment data, patient demographics, comorbidity statistics, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores, to build probabilistic models showing likelihood of ICU dependency in non-COVID-19 cases. By collating this data and visualizing it in a Tableau dashboard, surgeons could make informed decisions about the best cases to move forward with in what order, helping minimize adverse impacts on patients and health system alike. Clinicians applied similar predictive analytics and data visualizations to optimize the use of other hospital and clinical resources, such as exam rooms, further increasing operational efficiency and the patient experience. U of U Health has also applied predictive modeling and visual analytics in other emerging areas, including using data transparency to address vaccination hesitancy by tracking vaccines delivered to internal staff and sharing those numbers with the public. \u201cAnalytics and visualization have been key to providing excellent ongoing patient care,\u201d said Park, \u201cand to sustaining our operations in ways we can afford. Healthcare is a capital-intense business; we have a lot of brick and mortar to support, so the more efficiently we use that space, the better. At the same time, we value patient experience and outcomes above all else. Tableau has been instrumental in helping us meet these optimization challenges throughout the COVID-19 crisis and pushing us to be more predictive with our use of resources going forward.\u201d"

        "company": "Carsome",
        "content": "As Southeast Asia\u2019s largest integrated car e-commerce platform, Carsome is at the forefront of digitizing the region\u2019s used car industry and elevating the experience of both buyers and sellers. The company\u2019s end-to-end solutions for consumers and dealers include everything from inspection to ownership transfer to financing and promise a hassle-free service that\u2019s trusted, convenient, and efficient. Throughout its six years of operation, Carsome has gained a wealth of data points about the region\u2019s used car industry, which it uses to understand customer behaviour, inventory, and pricing. Tableau has simplified the analysis of this data, providing Carsome with faster insights which in return help to improve the customer experience. Carsome\u2019s analysis of demand and supply and clickstream analytics is extensive. It combines raw data from multiple sources and presents it in an easy-to-consume format to help employees make better and smarter decisions. For example, they can decide which inventory to source based on demand and fine-tune pricing algorithms to deliver the best value to sellers. The challenge before Tableau was that analysis consumed too much time, and it was difficult to drill down into the details. Insights were delayed, and employees could get lost in a barrage of dashboards and data that was not always relevant to their role. \u201cDecisions can be especially tough when we don\u2019t have all the information and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for us to have the whole story,\u201d said Piyush Palkar, Chief Data Officer at Carsome. \u201cWhether we\u2019re helping someone find their dream car or helping them get the best value for their used car, we can make sure every decision we make is the best one for our customers.\u201d Replacing its previous BI tool with Tableau has helped Carsome get the whole story from its data quickly and easily. Analysis can be performed at a much faster pace, and the visualizations are easy to digest so that users can see critical information at a glance. \u201cGetting faster insights to make faster decisions is the key to success in any business today. We are now able to easily do drill-down and bottom-up analysis as well as slicing and dicing the data quickly,\u201d said Palkar. \u201cTableau supports us with automated dashboards that provide up-to-date information and help us narrow in on what\u2019s important.\u201d For example, when evaluating funnel analytics, Carsome can quickly identify where drop-offs are occurring and direct its focus to the underlying cause. Carsome chose Tableau for a number of reasons, including its features, value, and massive community of users, which makes it easy to onboard BI resources. Deployment time was also a consideration for the fast-moving startup, and, in the end, it only took the company a couple of days to install and configure Tableau Server. Close to 300 employees have been onboarded so far as Carsome keeps growing and actively builds its data culture. The company wants to empower individuals at all levels with a sense of how data can add value to their work, and it holds frequent training sessions and weekly user groups to build data literacy. \u201cMany employees are already feeling empowered after discovering that much of the information they want is readily available, and there\u2019s no need for them to learn to write SQL scripts,\u201d said Palkar. While the data team supports various cross-functional teams with visualizations and reports, some employees take the initiative to create their own. Encouraged by the company, many have also turned to Tableau\u2019s broader community of users to seek answers and support. As a result of all these efforts, Carsome has seen a significant improvement in self-service and data-led decision making. For example, car inspectors and retail managers are able to come up with price proposals on their own using the company\u2019s Reserve Price Proposal & Price Prediction dashboard. There's also great collaboration around data, with employees sharing and commenting on Tableau workbooks to communicate and digest complex ideas and numbers. Carsome\u2019s business is centered on improving the experience of buyers and sellers, and they are, of course, the clear beneficiaries of its data transformation. For example, the decisions made with Tableau help to ensure Carsome has the cars that buyers want and allows the business development teams to recommend the best cars to dealers as well. Carsome is now building on these benefits by enriching the data in Tableau and making it a golden source of curated, validated, and trusted data. A new datalake plays an integral part in this and brings together production and third party market data where even machine learning model inputs are feeded back to Tableau. In the future, Palkar anticipates automation and augmented analytics will help Carsome do much more with its data by decreasing the time spent organizing and preparing datasets. \u201cIn time, we should be able to ask more questions of our data without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Or, to put it simply, we can worry less about tying our shoes and focus more on running.\u201d"

        "content": "The University of Texas at Austin is home to a diverse population of 50,000 students and 24,000 faculty and staff. A top global academic institution, it\u2019s also one of the largest public research universities in the country, with an annual budget of more than $650 million. To drive further success as a world-class university, Shiva Jaganathan, Chief Data Officer of Institutional Reporting, Research, and Information Systems leverages data as a strategic asset to deliver crucial insights to leadership on class structure, faculty awards, and other key areas. Prioritizing quick wins to gain traction, Jaganathan needed an agile approach to data access. Instead of investing time and effort required for typical data management tasks\u2014the data warehouse connecting to enterprise data resources and getting reports\u2014he used the university data available at that time. This method expedited analytics so decision-makers could quickly gain insights and generate data demand, a core component of data culture. One of Jaganathan\u2019s responsibilities was to help the leadership with recruitment and retention of top-performing faculty for university\u2019s main areas of growth and study, which was closely linked to planning for the unplanned. Analyzing teaching effectiveness, research projects and funding, student demand, and faculty productivity, Jaganathan ensured that classes had the right faculty ratio for classes and hybrid instruction during the pandemic, and for return to campus. Surveying and analyzing responses from students and faculty about their preferences for hybrid or remote instruction, the university was able to make short- and long-term decisions about class structure and the best use of the university\u2019s limited campus space.  Tableau dashboards also provided the capability to model response options for future scenarios related to the pandemic or other emergency situations, offering speed and flexibility to build a more resilient experience for students and faculty. Dashboards were also instrumental in uncovering insights for university leadership to understand diversity, equity, and inclusion metrics among its faculty for its awards distribution. Though UT Austin consistently nominated and awarded faculty across racial and gender lines, the analysis helped the university identify and address specific gaps in the awards nomination process. This data analysis was also crucial to understand UT Austin\u2019s competitiveness with other peer institutions. Uncovering these insights also improved both recruitment and retention efforts. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that we are recognizing the faculty research productivity and nominating them for major awards and retaining those faculty,\u201d Jaganathan said. Taking a deeper dive in faculty productivity, Jaganathan\u2019s team collaborated with an external firm, and developed a new score called \u201cNon-awards Scholarly Research Index\u201d to include metrics such as journal articles, citations, awards, and other indicators of productivity, then standardized that data by years of experience. As a result of this partnership, the analytics team developed a Tableau dashboard for the university provost and senior leadership. This dashboard serves as one of the tools to make informed decisions on faculty awards nominations. This generated even more interest in data as leadership manages the university through a time of significant change in the higher education experience  and workforce expectations. The university\u2019s work with Tableau also helped to foster a culture where data became an asset to drive better decision making. \u201cPutting valuable information into the hands of decision makers will continue to foster the university\u2019s data culture and improve its performance, no matter what changes lie ahead,\u201d Jaganathan explains."

        "company": "Duke Health",
        "content": "Duke University Health Systems (DUHS) has more than 22K employees and is the second largest private employer in North Carolina with a network of health services, hospitals, support services, and biomedical research. The DUHS IT team often works with the Duke University IT group and other internal organizations. Through the dedication of a small group of employees, there is now a growing data analytics community where data democracy, knowledge exchange, and team innovation thrive. Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server were integral to leveraging the massive amount of information across Duke. There was a Tableau User Group that brought together Tableau users at Duke to share best practices and new ideas, but no group existed to address the underlying data questions that feed Tableau in the first place\u2013what data exists, who can access it, and how can it be better. Claire Howell, Clinical Data Strategy Manager on the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) IT Clinical Data Strategy Team, and Rebecca McDaniel, Duke University IT Solutions Architect learned this first-hand when they worked on a data project together. Both had a passion for Tableau but realized they knew different pieces of information about data that others on their teams didn\u2019t. This insight put the spotlight on the unintentional information silos across departments, and an opportunity to centralize information for data analytics employees. As McDaniel put it, \u201cWe believed that before you can fully tap into the abilities of Tableau, you have to first create a foundation of information accessibility. Accessibility is empowerment. By empowering individuals to access data, they can then work together to maximize the use of those tools.\u201d  Joining forces with a larger team and surveying the analytics teams across Duke, Howell and McDaniel determined that a department-agnostic space\u2014a data analytics community\u2014was the strong foundation needed to help break down those barriers that existed in accessing data across the organization. \u201cWe tried to find this balance of not wanting to be too structured because we want it to be open source, but for people to feel empowered to make decisions themselves and to run with ideas,\u201d Howell said. What made the community even more effective for data accessibility was that it included both bottoms-up participation and executive sponsors to champion programs, provide transparency about decisions affecting data analytics teams, and shine a light on leadership and community priorities. Additionally, the community intentionally partnered with existing groups rather than duplicate efforts. For example, instead of creating a new Tableau User Group within the Duke Analytics Community, Duke Analytics Community members are routed to the Tableau User Group. With the perseverance put in, the data analytics community has become a success on many levels\u2014not just for its members, but for amplifying data culture across Duke. Data accessibility is woven into the group\u2019s DNA. As Howell put it, \u201cIt's been amazing how people have been so generous with sharing information. Leadership is coming in and allowing that space to be the stage to hear from analysts and try to get feedback on how things can be improved or better. It's been really rewarding.\u201d Some of the major results included: Reinforcing the power of the community beyond data analytics, the core team launched a logo contest for its ever-growing members without high hopes for a big response. Instead, ideas were submitted from more than a dozen members. \u201cIf we create the space for it, it turns out people do want to share, and helpful members are happy to respond. Seeing that happen organically doesn\u2019t feel like credit to us, it\u2019s the group,\u201d McDaniel said. This is just the beginning for the Duke Analytics Community.

        "title": "CDO Perspective: How data culture transformed Belcorp, the Latin America beauty giant",
        "company": "Belcorp",
        "content": "The largest pandemic of the century, economic turmoil, and drastic changes to the beauty consumer behavior, - while  many companies would see the scenario as a tremendous threat - Belcorp, a Latin American beauty corporation with headquarters in Peru and operations in 13 different countries, took the challenge to step up and fast-forward its digital transformation.   Change is not a stranger to Belcorp\u2019s Chief Technology, Data & Digital Officer Venkat Gopalan\u2019s repertoire. Since he joined the company 2 years ago, Belcorp went through a major digital transformation that touched every aspect of the business using technology as an enabler and people as the core of the strategy. With COVID-19, the company was challenged to stretch its boundaries, rethink its line of beauty products, and the way they have been doing business for the past 53 years. Gopalan and his team were ready for the changes and excited by the possibilities that the crisis may bring.  The results couldn't have been more impressive, the company was able to reduce its time to market by 40%, delivered 400% more projects in comparison to the previous 18 months, and was able to sustain its double-digit digital sales growth. Tableau functioned as a cockpit to manage the different pieces of the project, ensuring the best results in every single stage. \u201cWe feel that every crisis is an opportunity,\u201d says Gopalan. He continues, \u201cIt has been challenging, but I think that for every technology professional it is the opportunity of a lifetime to be part of the crisis and to reshape businesses. We can only reflect back in 5 to 10 years from now and say \u2018Oh, we were part of this\u2019. Now we are heads down so it\u2019s hard to see.\u201d  At the beginning of the pandemic, Gopalan and the executive committee, who usually meet once a month, shifted to meeting more often. \u201cWe had a number of sessions to analyze consumer adoption rates, what was happening to the market, and COVID-19 rates across the globe. Together, we would look at different scenarios (worst case, realistic and optimistic), assuring that cashflow and operation expenses were in control.\u201d  Questions like \u201cHow do we take advantage from this worldwide crisis?\u201d and \u201cHow do we look at the future?\u201d played a big role in these sessions. Being a data-driven company was crucial to acquiring the right answers and shaping what would soon become the future of Belcorp, a consumer-centric company and a fully digital business (spoiler: Tableau is not only part of the solution, but it\u2019s also deeply embedded in Belcorp\u2019s culture and its response to the crisis). Direct Selling, or door to door sales as it\u2019s often called in Latin America, has been part of Belcorp\u2019s backbone since its inception. The company was founded to empower women to become entrepreneurs and now has more than 800,000 independent consultants onboard. The pandemic and the inability to sell door to door shifted much of the face-to-face interactions to a new online model.  Belcorp\u2019s digital transformation turned into digital acceleration during the pandemic as consumer behaviors and preferences changed.  \u201cWe are transforming the consultants into social sellers, beauty advisors and influencers,\u201d explains Gopalan. \u201cIn our new model, every consultant will have their own online store. The consumer buys from this store and Belcorp ships directly to the consumer. This new model changes the business logistics and allows us to obtain improved insights on how to manage the relationship, and customer purchase behaviors.\u201d  This new online channel empowers consultants to reach more consumers outside of their usual network through social platforms and networks and encourages online sales. The beauty advisors can use their product expertise to showcase their favorite products and strengthen their relationship with customers online. \u201cThis stimulates sales through social media, which is crucial for us\u201d says Gopalan.  Belcorp was also able to shorten its consultant onboarding process from one full week to 15 minutes, making it more inclusive and available to a broader audience. From the final consumer's perspective, the new model allows personalization across the entire customer journey and reduces the lead time between making the purchase and receiving the final product. \u201cWe aspire to be the leaders in digital selling - and for that - we need to keep the consumer in the center of the business\u201d says Gopalan. To better understand and manage customer's insights he established a Customer Relationship Management team. Consumers are demanding more immediacy and customization through all the touch points, Tableau enables the eCRM team to transform insights into actions and quickly respond to the consumer preferences and needs.  During the pandemic, for example, there were many changes in consumer habits: \u201csome of the products they used before were no longer necessary, women were no longer wearing makeup on a daily basis. On the other hand, we saw an upcoming trend on skin care products and hand sanitizer\u201d, the reduction of the go-to market time enabled the company to bring innovation to the customer in less time while keeping up with the market trends.  \u201cWhile some of the customer behavior changes are here to stay for long term, some will be short term. Human beings are social in nature, they want to connect, feel and touch things in the stores so we do see a coming back some time next year\u201d anticipates Gopalan. By then, their eCRM team will have enough insights to continue delivering amazing, personalized experience to the customers.  Data Analytics and Artificial intelligence (AI) are a big part of Belcorp's strategy. Gopalan, who believes in continuous learning and is constantly in the forefront of technology and its evolution, has over 22 years of leading large-scale transformations for Fortune 100 companies across the globe and has experience of the impact AI can have across different verticals.  \u201cFrom cost efficiency to revenue increase, AI can have a tremendous impact on a company's financial results and accelerate its growth\u201d he explains.  To be able to explore AI\u2019s full potential, Belcorp first had to modernize its Business Intelligence, democratize its data with a self-service BI, and establish a data culture. The process started in 2018, and that was the beginning of a successful partnership between Tableau and Belcorp.  The project started with a few standard training sessions, and very soon the business teams realized that they no longer required the support of the BI team to perform daily analytical tasks. They were empowered to conduct their own analysis and make data-based decisions. As the adoption rate spiked so did the need to create a continuous learning environment to promote data culture and elevate its results, thus Belcorp Data Academy was born.  Data Academy goes far beyond advanced data training, or the learning paths that until recently, were part of Belcorp's daily life. Data Academy represents a change of mindset. It was conceived by Gopalan, together with the Business Intelligence team, to be the transformation that he expects to see in the company.   Data Academy has a very clear mission and set of values: \"To empower business people with technological skills that allow them to make decisions based on data, and for that we provide them with the best analytics development program in the market.\"   To create the Data Academy, Gopalan and the Business Intelligence team looked for benchmarks in the market, and established partnerships with key education leaders to design a program that catered to Belcorp\u2019s needs.   The program was designed taking in consideration 6 different career paths with specific objectives for each curriculum. It uses gamification as a tool to engage participants and is periodically evaluated using Kirkpatrick\u2019s model. Before rolling the program across the organization, Gopalan personally trained the executive committee. \u201cIf we want to change the mindset, it needs to be done from top to bottom.\u201d    Gopalan\u2019s vision was to evolve from looking at current data to predictive analytics. Now that Belcorp has reached this stage, the goal is to evolve to prescriptive analytics by 2023. \u201cWe know it\u2019s ambitious but are we\u2019re putting a tremendous amount of effort on this strategy to get there.\u201d  Empowering the right people with the right technology, and continuous learning tools has amazing results. Belcorp now has more than 3000 active Tableau users, more than 11,000 dashboards, and has extremely engaged internal data community. Being a data-driven company also helped the team deliver 400% more projects in comparison to the previous 18 months.  Gopalan says, \u201cWe created a very productive data community where businesses can take advantage of analytics to empower the whole organization\u201d. The data community is managed through an internal online social network where users can interact, share content, ask questions, and ultimately have some fun. To engage with the team there is a busy calendar that includes trivia competitions, webinars and fun events.  In the backend of Data Academy, Tableau is used as a powerhouse to track its evolution and daily status. \u201cEverything is in Tableau - who is learning what and how much they have learned in the courses. Every leader can track the progress of each member of their team through a dashboard\u201d Gopalan explains. Becoming an AI-driven organization by 2023 is Gopalan\u2019s main challenge. To get there, he manages a Monthly Transformation Office where he and his committee can define goals and review the progress. \u201cI set the agenda with the current transformations, dashboards and business cases - everything is in Tableau\u201d Gopalan explains.  Tableau serves as a cockpit to integrate all of the company data. Through the platform, they were able to capture and track the whole digital transformation. \u201cI am not a big fan of PowerPoint or Excel so everything is in Tableau - from the 170 capabilities we mapped, to technology adoption scale, and from consumer behavior insights to financial transactions, Tableau has it all.\u201d \u201cTableau has inspired me several times throughout my career. During the Tableau Conference 2019 I watched a keynote with a video that really caught my attention: \u2018We are data people\u2019\u201d says Gopalan.  The CDO records multiple videos to inspire his team and to promote data culture around Belcorp. \u201cAs a Leader, the role modeling is so crucial. What Leaders say and do can influence the whole company. I tend to create a lot of content and videos, because videos have a lot of power.\u201d Gopalan adapted Tableau\u2019s message to create his own version saying what data means to the business and what it means to people. \u201cData is beautiful and it becomes clear and transparent to everyone\u201d.  Hard work and a touch of humor are his recipe to success: \u201cWe try to have fun at Belcorp. It is not only about hard work but how we reach things in a very fun way and make life exciting for people. We feel that the power of data is so critical for everything.\u201d"

        "title": "Kdan Mobile builds a data culture to drive business growth",
        "company": "Kdan Mobile",
        "content": "Kdan Mobile Software Ltd. is a global SaaS provider led by Kenny Su, a software engineer and the company\u2019s founder and CEO. The company launched in 2009 with a PDF reader and now has a growing portfolio of cross-platform productivity and creativity solutions, including its e-signature service DottedSign, PDF and File Management Solution Document 365, and Creativity 365, a creative suite for designers and content creators. The company is currently expanding its portfolio into areas like Document AI following the completion of a successful Series B fundraising round totaling $16M USD. Tableau has supported the success of Kdan Mobile by helping the company build a data culture. The visual analytics platform enables employees at all levels within Kdan Mobile to make data-driven decisions and has had a positive impact on the company\u2019s bottom line. Results to date include a 50% improvement in return on ad spend (ROAS) for user acquisition and an 80% reduction in hours spent on weekly and monthly reporting. Kdan Mobile\u2019s Tableau-supported data journey began in 2019 when it decided to rebuild and expand its internal data team. Data Analyst Pei-Hsuan Hsia was one of those hired and joined with existing knowledge and experience with Tableau gained while in graduate school. So, when Kdan Mobile decided it needed a data analytics platform, Hsia recommended Tableau. \u201cTableau offers a really powerful way to explore and present data and with all of the resources available online, I was able to learn how to use it on my own,\u201d said Hsia. Ease of use and availability of training factored into Kdan Mobile\u2019s decision to use Tableau, but equally important was Tableau\u2019s flexibility. With data held in several databases, both cloud-based and local, the company needed a solution that could integrate with and combine multiple sources of information. Kdan Mobile brought in a consultant to work alongside its backend engineer and data team to set up Tableau Server and establish an internal dashboard for analytics of their various products across platforms. The company had previously used an external solution to monitor the performance of its iOS and Android apps. With Tableau, Kdan Mobile was able to manage these analytics internally and extend monitoring to its Windows apps. The project was completed within a quarter, helping to increase the data team\u2019s confidence in Tableau and leading to new use cases. Kdan Mobile used Tableau to create a Finance and Fundraising Index to prepare for its Series B fundraising round. The dashboards supported the finance team in preparing data on product lines and global revenue, including breakdown of different revenue streams. The use of Tableau also improved the way data was evaluated, helping to ensure compliance through the permission-based access features. Today, Tableau is used across Kdan Mobile's entire business and supports the objectives and key results (OKR) methodology it uses to set and monitor goals. For example, Kdan Mobile has a dashboard in Tableau that\u2019s continually refreshed with information like daily revenue and daily advertising costs. The dashboard acts as the company\u2019s kanban board, helping everyone visualize progress and identify any gaps that might impact the ability to meet their goals. Tableau has also helped Kdan Mobile optimize its user acquisition funnel and monetization model. In the past, team members would gather for three-hour meetings on a monthly basis to review this model and find opportunities to increase ROI. The meetings entailed taking data monitored by three different laptops and writing the numbers on the wall for discussion. Due to the complexity and time commitment, it was only possible to have those meetings on a monthly basis, limiting the opportunities for product and business leaders to adjust strategy. Now, through Tableau, adjustments can be made more often based on real-time data access. Now, all of the data can be visualized in a single dashboard, helping Kdan Mobile better understand where and when to invest its budget and to capitalize on previously unseen opportunities. Analysis is 6x more efficient and has led to a 50% increase in ROAS. Kdan Mobile\u2019s use of Tableau has grown quickly in the past two years with almost every team now leveraging dashboards to make key decisions. For example, product teams have a feature usage dashboard that helps them decide which features to focus on or replace. Marketing and business development teams have dashboards that monitor stats like sign-ups and provide insights on how to best design and adjust promotional strategies. Adoption has been supported and encouraged through the promotion of online learning and peer-to-peer sharing. For example, every Friday there\u2019s a session where people can come together to discuss data-related topics and share best practices. I-Hsiu Tseng, Data Analytics Manager at Kdan Mobile, shared that there has been a real culture change within the company as people become more comfortable and confident in exploring their own data. \u201cWe see a data-driven mindset being essential for every organization in the near future and we\u2019ve achieved that at Kdan Mobile where everyone could be considered to be part of our expanded data team,\u201d said Tseng. \u201cMany of those employees used to wait in line for us to create dashboards. Now they can access and explore data on their own and come to us for discussion. It has reduced time spent performing manual and complicated calculations and improved communication and collaboration.\u201d The insights and efficiency provided by Tableau also support Kdan Mobile\u2019s global expansion where it has a whole new set of challenges and metrics to track. \u201cWithout Tableau, we might need to hire five times as many people. However, the transparency and insights it provides helps us with a number of activities, from product development to setting smart campaign strategies,\u201d said US-based VP of Marketing & Strategy Wei-Chung Wang."

        "title": "Vicinity Centres takes insight-driven approach to retail asset management",
        "company": "Vicinity Centres ",
        "content": "Vicinity Centres is one of Australia\u2019s leading retail property groups with $22 billion in retail assets under management across 60 shopping centres in six states. These centres include premium locations like the Queen Victoria Building in Sydney and Australia\u2019s number one retail destination, Chadstone \u2013 The Fashion Capital. Shopping centres are a complex ecosystem of retailers and customers, with financial performance influenced by geographic location, demographics, and the mix of retail stores. Understanding these complex influences is crucial for making effective decisions around marketing, leasing, centre development, and capital allocation and that\u2019s one of the reasons why Vicinity has been steadily building its in-house data science and insights capabilities. With Tableau, Vicinity\u2019s centre management and leasing teams across Australia can now access a range of data points to better inform decision-making and help manage initiatives like social distancing inside shopping centres. Some of these data points were previously siloed in spreadsheets while some were simply not captured at all. \u201cThe journey we\u2019ve been on has been about putting as much data as we can in the hands of our people so they can make more informed decisions. Alongside this, there\u2019s been a real effort to improve our data collection,\u201d said Coleman. As an example, Vicinity has installed traffic counters at each shopping centre to gather robust data on footfall. It\u2019s also expanded its collection and analysis of Wi-Fi data, bank card transaction data, demographics, and mobile phone location data to create insights that can improve retailer and customer experiences. All data is stored in a centralised data lake, with a data warehouse on top containing more usable datasets, including machine learning and forecasting models. Tableau is used to visualise these datasets and provide business users with easy, immediate access to insights. For instance, leasing executives now have a suite of Tableau dashboards that enable\ninteractive analysis of tenant performance, examining specific stores, categories, centres, and retail brands. The insights gained help to ensure each retailer is placed in the right location for more sustainable profitability allowing Vicinity to leverage the full value of their shopping centre space. Vicinity\u2019s adoption of Tableau has scaled from 130 licenses in 2015 to 750 licenses as at September 2021. The majority of these licenses are held by Tableau Viewers who are able to access more than 300 live dashboards from Vicinity\u2019s Tableau insights portal. The portal\u2014accessed via the Vicinity intranet\u2014was developed leveraging best practice from Tableau on how to establish an effective folder and permissions structure. It features groups and sub-groups linked to topics and job roles and includes links to educational resources for new users. And while onboarding was a challenge in the beginning, the use of the portal has grown to include more than 600 employees and receives more than 30,000 dashboard views monthly. One of the hurdles to onboarding was familiarising users with a whole new way to access data. To help, Vicinity created online training videos and set up a dedicated Tableau support email. It also established a Tableau Creators group in Microsoft Teams to share updates, events, and training opportunities. Awareness and uptake of Tableau has also grown as a result of the platform being embedded into key business processes like Vicinity\u2019s shopping centre budget and planning process undertaken semi-annually. In addition to pushing out data for daily analysis and reporting, Vicinity\u2019s Data Science & Insights team has leveraged Tableau to support a number of key initiatives. One of these is an ongoing drive to reduce consumption of energy which has both an impact on environment and profitability. Vicinity particularly wanted to reduce peak consumption, on which energy tariffs are based. This in mind, the Data Science & Insights team built a machine learning algorithm to analyse factors like footfall, weather, day and time, to forecast energy demand 24 hours in advance. The forecasts, which are visualised using Tableau, are then used by centre-based operations teams to enact strategies that reduce peak consumption. This initiative has resulted in significant cost avoidance as well as additional analysis to optimise use of solar energy and help Vicinity in its pursuit to achieve net zero carbon emissions. Tableau has also been leveraged to navigate the impacts of COVID-19. For example, Vicinity has created a Vision, Strategy, Action plan KPI dashboard to track COVID-19 recovery and general shopping centre performance. Additional dashboards help Vicinity track and manage leasing performance which has been particularly complex during COVID-19 due to the need to more closely monitor retail debt, store closures and COVID-related lease variations. Previously, debt data was difficult and time consuming to track. However, with COVID-19 it became a business-critical metric, leading the Data Science and Insights team to collate the data into its data warehouse and provide stakeholders with curated dashboards based on their role within the debt reporting and collection process. Actions triggered by this data contributed to a 36% improvement in Vicinity\u2019s debt position from May 2020 to May 2021. Another key initiative related to COVID-19 has been the use of Tableau dashboards to help manage social distancing and keep retailers and consumers safe. For example, over the 2020 Christmas period, Vicinity used Tableau to analyse Wi-Fi location data and identify areas of concern and understand how much traffic could cause them to become congested. Key stakeholders were then informed of areas of concern and provided with a near-live dashboard showing current and predicted levels of traffic. This data-driven approach not only helped Vicinity navigate the Christmas period without issue, but also gave the business a competitive advantage through extensive media coverage and public commentary. While Vicinity has established a sophisticated data science capability and an increasingly data-driven culture, it sees many opportunities ahead. For example, there are many processes within Vicinity that could benefit from data automation such as automated pricing recommendations for Vicinity\u2019s casual mall leasing space short term leases for specific \u2018kiosk\u2019 areas within the malls. There\u2019s also room to grow the business\u2019 community of data experts and further enable employees to make sense of their own data. \u201cWe\u2019ve built a really strong centralised data team, but there\u2019s definitely an opportunity for each individual department to take more ownership of their data and how it\u2019s consumed,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cAdditionally, if we look at where we\u2019re at today, a lot of the models and dashboards we produce are focused on better understanding and managing our centres. In the future, we see an opportunity to leverage this IP to benefit our retail partners more directly.\u201d"

They actively support the trend of improving small businesses by stimulating large enterprises, making society more interesting, and improving the world as a whole. To that end, they aim to provide service at a world-class level of quality, continually making improvements to the products themselves as well as their responses to customer inquiries. Tableau is used as the analytical platform that underlies all of this. \u201cAt freee, we have been data-driven since our founding and also got into analytics at a very early stage,\u201d said freee CIO Teppei Tosa. He says that many personnel are capable of actually writing lines of SQL. \u201cHowever, the organization has grown so rapidly that I can no longer say that everyone can write SQL. In order to sustain a data-driven company culture, it was necessary to create an environment in which people who can write SQL and those who can\u2019t are able to talk to each other on the same playing field.\u201d Regarding the time before Tableau was implemented, \u201cWe built a data warehouse with Amazon Redshift and extracted data using Redash,\u201d said Analytics manager Yosuke Sekikawa. He explained that to produce data, people would write their own queries and visualize the results in Redash or in a spreadsheet. \u201cHowever, this approach had limitations. Since visualization was labor-intensive, only one pattern of visualization was possible, and this made exploratory analysis difficult.\u201d   To resolve these problems, freee began considering how to create a new analytical infrastructure. They would select an analytical tool that can be used with Google BigQuery, to which they would be extracting data. \u201cSince we knew we would be using Google, our first candidates were the BI products that Google had acquired,\u201d said Sekikawa. However, they ultimately selected Tableau and submitted the proposal to adopt Tableau to the CIO (Tosa). Tosa approved of Tableau implementation immediately. He explained the reasons as follows: \u201cI already knew of Tableau. I thought it was a good idea to implement something that would be easy to use on the front lines, and I felt that it sufficiently guaranteed security as well.\u201d The big prerequisite to approving of Tableau was ROI visualization. After using it for six months, they compiled a performance report to see what impact had been made. The first team to use Tableau was the Support Team. This team was proactive about using Tableau from the very beginning, said Sekikawa. Next, they began performing analysis for the purpose of improving products. They also started visualizing product usage rates and churn rates. They implemented Objectives and Key Results (OKR) as a method of objective management. Further, they worked to quantify performance. There are three major reasons why Tableau was selected over competing BI products. First, as stated, Tableau is easy to use for users on the front lines. Since Tableau enables even those who can\u2019t write SQL to conduct exploratory analysis, it eliminates disparities in technical skill. freee is a growth company, and it is expected to have much more analysis to do in the years ahead. It needs an analysis platform that is guaranteed to be able to handle that work. Since Tableau is easy to use, the quality of the analysis dashboard can be standardized to improve the precision of analysis performed. Second, Tableau enables you to start small. \u201cBefore deploying throughout the company, we needed to measure our ROI. This required us to start small,\u201d said Sekikawa. However, it was surprisingly difficult to start small with competing BI products. \u201cBy contrast, Tableau offered a price structure that makes it easy to start small.\u201d Third, many personnel can use Tableau effectively. \u201cWe had several people join the company even outside of Analytics who had experience using Tableau, so we felt we could expect to be able to promote its use even outside of specific teams. Moreover, there are lots of people throughout the world in general who can use Tableau, so we determined that we would be able to avoid situations such as data analysis becoming a job that only one person knows how to carry out.\u201d \u201cImplementing Tableau benefited the Support Team in two major ways,\u201d said Hiroaki Suzuki, who assists the Support Team as an Analytics Data Scientist. Greatly reduce time spent on data extraction and hypothesis testing\n\n\nFirst, the data extraction process was made much simpler. \u201cPreviously, we created ten to twenty spreadsheets through Redash every time we wanted to visualize KPI. Now we can just use Tableau to conduct multifaceted analysis with one Viz.\u201d Simple Exploratory Analysis\n\n\nSecond, Tableau has made exploratory analysis much simpler. \u201cSince analytical parameters can now be changed without using SQL, it\u2019s easier to derive hypotheses from the data. Teams who used to take around 32 hours from data extraction to hypothesis formation now take two hours. It is also easier to visualize the full query funnel and simpler to drill down, so it\u2019s easier to see what needs to be bolstered.\u201d Speed up the improvement cycle\n\n\nThis sort of streamlining has also sped up the improvement cycle. \u201cIn the past, each project would complete two improvement cycles at most per quarter. Since we implemented Tableau, this has been boosted to three cycles,\u201d said Sekikawa. With results like these, Tosa predicts that \u201ceven based just on what we see now, we should be able to recover our initial investment in one year.\u201d \u201cMoving forward, we are interested in linking Tableau with our operational platform, Salesforce,\u201d said Sekikawa. He explained that, ultimately, they would like to embed Tableau\u2019s Viz into Salesforce. If this were possible, the Customer Success Team and others could conduct data-backed decision-making as a part of their daily work. Additionally, enabling performance management visualizations in Salesforce would likely streamline the process by which accounting and operational departments compare results. \u201cfreee has a different design philosophy than conventional accounting systems, and I feel that Tableau takes a similar approach,\u201d said Tosa. It shows great power to open up tasks to everyone that were once restricted to specialists. \u201cWe plan to continue actively utilizing Tableau moving forward, growing the company through data-driven decision-making.\u201d"

        "content": "TDK Group continues to utilize technology to give back to society and achieve a sustainable, happy community. At present, under the Digi-TDK banner, we are moving ahead with two types of transformations, \u201cEnergy Transformation (EX)\u201d and \u201cDigital Transformation (DX),\u201d to accelerate our sustainability initiatives. Active utilization of data plays a key role in sustaining these efforts. \u201cThere was already a strong awareness of the importance of making decisions based on data,\u201d said Takao Aoki, who is responsible for business intelligence-related systems in TDK\u2019s Information Systems Division and is currently leading the Tableau Implementation Team in the Business Systems - Operational Support Group. However, before the implementation of Tableau, Excel VBA was the primary tool used for in-house development. Although there was an effort made to implement BI products, users were not able to make use of them as well as anticipated, and users often ended up performing analysis with Excel sheets. \u201cWe did provide some tools developed from scratch for VBA or the web, but they were not good for data visualization. Even if the tools were used to output cross tables, it was common practice for users to run that data through Excel as a secondary process,\u201d said Aoki. \u201cIn addition, we also actually tried out other products for which we had licenses and tested other similar well-known tools in the self BI sector, but we never quite managed to enable completely unrestricted self-service analysis of data.\u201d   One day, a division head came to Aoki with a question. \u201cMy subordinates are having a lot of their time every month eaten up by data analysis. Some people have recommended Tableau recently. Could we use that?\u201d Aoki\u2019s team took this and offered the division head an improvement idea using Tableau Desktop. This idea ended up being a success that satisfied users. Later, the Marketing Division also expressed interest in using Tableau, and Tableau Server was installed. In 2019, the service was expanded throughout the entire company and has become TDK\u2019s standard BI platform. Tableau usage has been skyrocketing ever since, reaching around 1,100 users and over 10,000 monthly accesses in July 2021. One particularly active hub of Tableau use has been the Communication Devices Business Group, which is responsible for the production of 5G chip antennas at the Electronic Components Business Company. Manabu Echigoya, head of the Production Technology Department in Mobile RF Components Supervision in the same group, explained as follows. \u201cWe used Tableau Prep Builder to combine into a single database the log data / process performance data saved on the Oracle database and the product information data saved on PostgreSQL. We then published that to Tableau Server for analysis. Tableau is easy to use, so there\u2019s a constant flow of data to analyze. We\u2019ve been working on IoT for five years now, but I think it\u2019s thanks to Tableau that our analysis platform is finally in place.\u201d There are three major reasons why Tableau was adopted as the company-wide BI platform. The first is how intuitive it is to operate. \u201cTo achieve self-service BI, the user needs to find the tools easy to use,\u201d said Aoki. Since Tableau is similar in concept to a pivot table in Excel and intuitive to use, it is simple to select filters and there are many variations of formulas available. The second reason is the beautiful visualizations. Even with default settings, Tableau creates attractive graphs that draw users\u2019 interest, said Aoki. According to Satoshi Tsukiyama, Section Head in the Production Technology Department for Mobile RF Components Supervision (Communication Devices Business Group), the third reason is \u201cthe importance of rapidly importing massive amounts of data from a wide range of data sources. Even big data with tens of millions of rows can be published using Tableau in just a few minutes.\u201d Echigoya and Tsukiyama describe the benefits of Tableau usage as follows. Instantaneous, intuitive data visualization\n\n\u201cTableau enables us to easily visualize data,\u201d said Tsukiyama. \u201cWe could of course make graphs in Excel, but Tableau enables us to make graphs instantly and more intuitively. In terms of the user experience, it is ten times faster and allows a lot of freedom. Even though I can\u2019t program, Tableau makes me feel like I\u2019ve become a programmer.\u201d Large reduction in data aggregation time\n\n\u201cWe managed to really cut down on data aggregation time,\u201d said Echigoya. \u201cPreviously, we would spend days cleaning our data in Excel, but now it\u2019s done in a flash. For some tasks, this has cut down work hours by 99%. Personally, I am completely enamored with Tableau Prep.\u201d Changes how we view data\n\n\u201cYou can only show results on Excel sheets, but with Tableau you can really dig into the background of those results,\u201d said Echigoya. \u201cYou can also automatically tabulate equipment utilization rates and process yield rates, as well as show the latest data for each day in Viz. As a result, it\u2019s easier to determine the causes of problems when they arise, and we\u2019ve drastically lowered the amount of time it takes to make improvements.\u201d \u201cOur vision for the future is to achieve end-to-end product traceability by linking the entire process from ordering to production, inventory, sales, and shipment,\u201d said Tsukiyama. If this process could be visualized, he said, then the PDCA cycle could be moved through more quickly. \u201cWe would also like to work on production capacity simulation based on data analysis in order to better serve ever-changing customer demands.\u201d \u201cIdeally, all data would be linked together,\u201d said Echigoya. \u201cNot just internal factory data or internal company data, but also market data from outside the company. I expect that Tableau will fulfill an important role as a platform that connects all of this data together.\u201d Aoki said that in the future, they will develop more data sources to import into Tableau to better handle these kinds of requests from business divisions. \u201cAll of the data we want is already on the Tableau Server, so what\u2019s left is simply selecting an analytical approach. The Tableau Implementation Team is going to focus on building up the environment to be able to provide this system on a global scale.\u201d"

        "content": "Global network provider, Telef\u00f3nica, is one the largest telecommunications companies in the world, with 345 million customers (in 2020) and a comprehensive service offering. The company launched Telef\u00f3nica Tech, headquartered in Madrid, to unlock the power of integrated technology, combining expertise around IoT, Cloud, Security, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data to create innovative new solutions for B2B customers. While many companies collect large volumes of data, turning it into actionable insights and creating new revenue streams can be challenging; requiring the expertise of data scientists and a dedicated analytics platform. Individual businesses also lack an industry-wide context for their data, which Telef\u00f3nica has access to via its vast sources of cross-sector anonymized data. We spoke to Elena Gil Lizasoain, Global Director of Product and Business Operations, and Francisco Celeiro, Global Head of Product Development, in IoT & Big Data Telef\u00f3nica Tech, about the role of Tableau in unlocking insights that bring new opportunities and services, customer-centricity, and higher revenues to customers across multiple sectors globally. Elena: Our vision is to help customers to use data as a differentiator. As part of Telef\u00f3nica, we have access to an enormous volume of data from billions of data points, including connected devices, customer technology, and mobile data. Many customers don\u2019t have the resources to be able to analyse such large volumes of data in-house, so we offer professional services to help them define a strategy and give them access to data scientists and analytics capabilities. We can even aggregate their data with our own anonymised data to get more accurate insights in their industry.\n  Francisco: After processing data, our centre of excellence works to deliver a use case for each customer. We\u2019re uniquely placed to help our customers to really push boundaries with the endless opportunities from real insights, and we can do that across any industry. To give you some examples, our mobile phone data can be leveraged to track the movement of millions of people anonymously, which could be useful to help transport companies plan new routes, or to help governments plan how much budget to allocate to tourism. As we build smarter cities we have the scale to bring together all those different data streams and to turn them into actionable insight.   Elena: Now more than ever companies are realising the importance of collecting data and extracting meaningful insights to drive smarter decisions, but as more services are digitalised, diversity of data is also growing at a rapid rate, which can make it hard to collate and process that data. Tableau is a very important partner for us and an essential part of our service offering. It simplifies collecting, aggregating, and visualising data, allowing customers to explore and analyse their data.  Francisco: You can't understate the importance of being able to deliver insights to the customer in a clear and attractive way. We translate a huge amount of data into a format that any employee can understand. We're also a multinational company and using Tableau Server allows us to create templated dashboards that we can adjust for every case to give customers consistency, and also personalisation.      Elena: We use Tableau across all functions of the company, from making programme recommendations to customers with a TV package, to optimising our infrastructure, streamlining product management, and even identifying where employees could use more training. Tableau is at the very core of our business.\n  Francisco: Hundreds of millions of global smartphone users are Telef\u00f3nica customers. From a business intelligence perspective that\u2019s massive. We can cross sell, use insights to manage the customer relationships, reduce churn, and understand next best actions for our customers and our business. It makes every part of our business more efficient and helps us achieve our goals, while guiding employees to make smarter decisions. Data supports all our strategies at Telef\u00f3nica, it is the powerhouse that fuels all of our decisions now. Our culture has changed completely. Our data culture has become intrinsic to us.   Elena: Tableau will continue to complement our capabilities as we grow and enhance our service offering. We really value its versatility, ease of use, and how scalable and flexible it is. It\u2019s also a very stable platform, which is great to help us deliver on our commitments with customers. In terms of where we go next, we\u2019re still in the process of unlocking the full potential of IoT, Big Data, and AI. There\u2019s going to be a huge amount of data from sensors out in the field that will reveal a lot of useful insights \u2013 we call it the AI of Things. Tableau is going to remain an invaluable platform and a strategic partner for us as we extract the value from these technologies and expand our services to more sectors and customers."

        "company": "Griffith University",
        "content": "Griffith University is a comprehensive, research-intensive university, ranking in the top 2% of universities worldwide. The university\u2019s teaching and research spans six campuses in South East Queensland and it has a staff of 4,000 supporting 55,000 students each year. As an organization of this size, Griffith generates a vast amount of data, and it has developed a robust business intelligence (BI) function that optimizes data for strategic and operational planning. With Tableau, the BI and Analytics team has developed more than 150 dashboards that provide deep insights into the university\u2019s research, learning and teaching, staff, and students. The team is also helping to build a strong data culture within the university and there are now 1,600 employees using Tableau for activities like planning, budgeting, and forecasting. Like many other higher education institutions, Griffith\u2019s activities are broadly split across research and education. The university tracks a range of metrics that help it plan and manage these activities and maintain its competitive position. To manage its research activities and understand the impact of grants, the university tracks things like how many projects have been published or cited. To manage resource planning and teaching allocation, it tracks a range of human resources metrics. Mark Jeffrey, Senior Strategic Leader BI and Analytics at Griffith University shared that most of the university\u2019s data relates to its students. \u201cWe look at the entire lifecycle of the student, from the point of application through to when they graduate and then, ideally, when they return as a postgraduate or a Higher Degree Research student. We also collect data to understand their graduate outcomes and how their field of employment ties back to their program of study,\u201d said Jeffrey. With the help of Tableau, Griffith is using this data to understand better the student journey and how it can better support people to move through it. It\u2019s also optimizing the intelligence gained from all of the other data it collects to help employees at all levels make data-driven decisions. Tableau was brought in by the BI and Analytics team to replace a legacy analytics tool that was overly complex and a burden to manage. For instance, every time there was an upgrade to the infrastructure, there was real concern something would break, and dashboards would have to be rebuilt. As data volumes grew, there was also extra work involved in managing the infrastructure. When transitioning to Tableau, the team focused on reducing complexity and making dashboards easier to understand. Tableau has also helped to reduce the complexity of managing infrastructure. The university primarily uses Tableau Server, which connects directly to a data warehouse that holds a rich array of curated data that\u2019s been collected over 10 years. Around 250GB of data is sent from the data warehouse into Tableau every day, while Tableau also connects directly to a few SQL server environments. \u201cWe love Tableau Server and the simplicity of the architecture, which makes it really easy to update and interact with the infrastructure. The Tableau Knowledge Base is also full of specific examples which help us troubleshoot any issues and improve things like our refresh speeds,\u201d said Jeffrey. \u201cOur analysts and the Data Warehouse team work closely together to curate the data in the best possible way so we can get the best performance and value from our analytics.\u201d When the BI and Analytics team launched Tableau to the university three years ago, they began with three simple dashboards and took the time to gain feedback and establish some best practices. Ever since the team has remained committed to providing users with the best possible experience, and it uses Tableau itself to understand trends in user behavior. \u201cWith Tableau, we\u2019re only limited by our ability to ask questions. It tells us everything we need to know about the performance of our dashboards and how they\u2019re being used,\u201d said Jeffrey. Over the last year, the team has had an increasing focus on adoption. It has run a number of live online events to give employees the opportunity to learn more about Tableau and how it can support them in their work. The format of the events has enabled attendees to submit any questions anonymously, which has resulted in increased engagement. The Business and Analytics team frequently promotes new features and dashboards and it has created an entire portal on the university\u2019s intranet where staff can access a range of dashboards and reports. The team has also built a recommendation engine with Tableau, which it uses to point users to dashboards that are relevant to their role. All of these activities have helped drive uptake of Tableau, and there are now 1,600 total users across the university, with around 800 active in any given week. There are also between 50-70 users who are set up as Explorers and support different functional areas of the university. Most importantly, there\u2019s a greater understanding of data analytics across the university, with dashboards increasingly used to inform decision-making. The next step for the BI and Analytics team is to work with users to help them better leverage their data in real-time, rather than relying on static reports. \u201cWhile there\u2019s always a need to digest and reflect on data, we can see a future where more people are also using their data in real-time to make the best decisions they can,\u201d said Jeffrey."

It does this by enriching customers\u2019 data with its own data set and then creating and activating different segments for advertising. One of the key reasons customers sign up for Zeotap is the quality and scale of its data. So it\u2019s vital for the sales team to understand the quality and volume of available data and to be able to share this with prospective customers. \"One of our challenges in the past was the delay in everyone having access to this type of information,\u201d said Gunnu Sirohi, Business Intelligence Manager at Zeotap. \u201cIf someone wanted to understand something about our data, the Analytics team would need to crunch through billions of rows to prepare the analysis. It could take days or even weeks at times.\u201d Zeotap evaluated several solutions to streamline analysis and reporting before choosing Tableau. The company had already embedded Tableau into its CIP solution and was able to work with the same partner, Goldstone Technologies, to implement Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server for internal data sharing. \"Goldstone has played a critical role in helping us embed Tableau into our product and our business. They\u2019ve helped with setting up authentication, ensuring we remain GDPR compliant, and also manipulating dashboards, so they align to our product user interface,\u201d said Sirohi. Sirohi added that the implementation of Tableau for internal use was seamless. It involved connecting Tableau to the company\u2019s PostgreSQL database, running custom SQL, and setting up new dashboards. The dashboards, which are refreshed automatically, have eliminated the need for the Analytics team to manually create new reports for sales every time there\u2019s a new request for proposal. In addition, the sales team can access the data they need immediately, rather than waiting an average of three to four days. In addition to resolving the issue of long wait times for data, Tableau has helped Zeotap gain deeper insights into sales and revenue data. In particular, executives can better understand which products and segments contribute the most revenue and therefore make more informed decisions about cross-selling and upselling strategies. The company\u2019s use of Tableau is growing, with 50 employees accessing the platform, up from just 20 one year ago. These include executives as well as sales, sales enablement, and marketing teams. To upskill employees, Zeotap took advantage of the 90 days of free learning offered by Tableau early on in the pandemic, and it is continuing to run regular training sessions internally. The Analytics team also actively seeks out best practices and gets daily inspiration from other businesses via Tableau\u2019s Viz of the Day. Moving forward, Zeotap plans to connect its other systems to Salesforce, including Salesforce, NetSuite, and finance tools. \u201cAs we grow, we see Tableau becoming our single source of truth for everything, which will make it even easier for employees to be self-reliant when it comes to data and analytics,\u201d said Sirohi.

        "title": "Sysco LABS leverages customer behavior insights to help field reps transition customers to self-service",
        "company": "Sysco LABS",
        "content": "Global food service supplier Sysco operates 326 distribution facilities worldwide and serves more than 600,000 customer locations. The company's modernization efforts in recent years have focused on innovations in e-commerce that enable customers to self-serve their inventory needs in lieu of relying on assistance from a sales representative. During the COVID-19 pandemic, that evolution was put to the test, as Sysco relied on self-service methods to help its customers stay in business, while also protecting against its own losses. The journey to this success started in 2019, when Sysco LABS, a tech subsidiary within the company, rolled out the Sysco e-commerce app, called Sysco Shop, and formed a product analytics team to better understand customer orders placed across the mishmash of tracking systems being used for sales accounting. Based on this data, they began using Tableau to visualize order activity more clearly and in greater detail, and to enable insights for the sales and sales leadership teams.  \u201cWe stood up a sales-facing dashboard showing all orders placed by customers and internal associates,\u201d said Megan Oertel, director of product analytics at Sysco LABS. \u201cThis helped us promote the self-service model, because we could see by account or by geographic area where our e-commerce platform was being used, which customers were engaging with it, and where they needed help from the reps.\u201d Enabling self-service for customers provided several key advantages to Oertel's team and to the Sysco business overall. Sales associates now spend less time keying in customer orders and more time on value-driven activities. Shop incorporates cross-sell and upsell opportunities into the shopper's experience, rather than relying on sales associates to initiate those discussions. Most importantly for Oertel's team, having customers do the shopping for themselves makes it possible to track their behavior.  \u201cIf they don't shop, we can't tailor our offerings to what they need,\u201d Oertel said. \u201cWe need the data. If the shopper is in there clicking around, only then can we surface items directly to them, give them targeted promotions, and change the flow of their experience to make it more personalized and intuitive.\u201d   To promote better intelligence about customer needs, Oertel's team set up event tagging in Sysco Shop to capture and analyze business data, such as what customers search for and how those searches relate to what they end up ordering. This data is then streamed into other visualizations using Tableau, offering insights into customer behavior, improving the customer experience, and enabling Sysco sales reps to take meaningful, timely action. For example, insights into how many customers went directly to their saved lists without searching or browsing for additional items informed successful new campaigns and UI enhancements, such as product suggestions, email reminders, and enabling hover-over in the UI for getting more information about a product. Currently, Oertel's team stores all Sysco Shop data in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 and Amazon Redshift cloud solution. Tableau connects easily to AWS and to sales personnel data stored in Microsoft Active Directory and Salesforce B2B Commerce Cloud to enable personalized experiences for all sales associates, enabling them to readily visualize and investigate data that is specific to their accounts. The Sysco LABS Deployment and Demo Center delivered trainings, webinars, and recorded guidance to get field reps familiar with the dashboards so they could help customers shift more easily to self-service shopping and ordering as needed. This team works closely with Oertel's analytics team to drive Tableau and Sysco Shop adoption across the Sysco enterprise. Six Sysco delivery managers (SDMs) on the deployment team engage with more than 1,000 sales associates and support personnel at 12-14 locations in each of the six sales territories, providing resources and support in the form of: These efforts were complemented by thoughtful metrics the deployment team derived for keeping adoption on track, particularly with their own personnel. \u201cOur SDMs have their compensation directly tied to the success of our technology platforms,\u201d said Amir Mahboobi, senior director of deployment at Sysco LABS. \u201cWe track KPIs related to adoption and usage of the platform by customers, which in turn, enables our sales reps to spend more time with our customers, creating value for them.  We also track softer factors, such as the gain in competencies each sales associate achieves over time with the SDM\u2019s help.\u201d Oertel emphatically endorses this approach. \u201cAs we learned from following Tableau Blueprint, changing the culture is an essential component of rolling out any transformational solution like this one,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd even though product analytics is just a small part of Sysco overall, we've made a big impact, and we wouldn't have been successful without the efforts of Amir and his team.\u201d For companies looking to build their deployment and adoption competency around Tableau-based e-commerce analytics solutions, Mahboobi offers the following advice: Widespread adoption of Sysco Shop was successful, and the business results have been significant. As of early May 2021, over 70% of orders in the e-commerce ordering platform were placed directly by customers instead of by sales consultants or support representatives, representing a 46% gain in customer-placed orders within one month after US-wide deployment. The analytics team also sent weekly emails to more than 7,000 personnel promoting the e-commerce data. Beyond enabling customer self-service, Oertel's team is committed to helping business units across Sysco with getting their own access to insights in real time through Sysco LABS dashboards. \u201cOur goal is to keep our analytics function lean and focused on ever better ways of making insights available from data,\u201d she said. \u201cTo make that possible, we're using the strengths of Tableau to help non-technical users easily ask questions from the data directly, instead of having to submit a request with our team.\u201d"

        "company": "Punchh",
        "content": "Founded in 2010, Punchh is a rapidly growing SaaS provider that helps physical retailers supercharge the in-store and online customer experience. Its products include an AI-powered customer engagement platform as well as solutions for loyalty and offer management. Through these solutions, Punchh helps retailers leverage their data to optimize customer engagement and maximize lifetime value. \"We surface dozens of metrics that help retailers understand and drive customer behavior. These include things like campaign results, average receipt size, and the frequency and timing of in-store visits,\" said Xin Heng, Vice President, Head of Data at Punchh. Many of these insights are enabled by Tableau, which is used to produce analytics for internal and external stakeholders. Punchh has also begun using Tableau to prototype new products, saving the company significant time and costs. Punchh's business is based on the value of data, so it's no surprise it has a strong data culture. The business' challenge before Tableau was that data was not always fast or easy to access, with spreadsheets used for internal analysis and reporting. Discussing the reasons Punchh adopted Tableau; Heng pointed to the need for efficient and evidence-based decision-making. \"Imagine an executive wanting data to make a decision tomorrow and being told it would take seven days,\" said Heng. \"They can't wait that long for a number to be crunched; they need data they can trust right away.\" Tableau has met Punchh's need for fast, accurate insights. It was chosen partly because of its large number of connectors, enabling data to be visualized from virtually any source. For now, Tableau connects directly to an organized file store in Punchh\u2019s data lake using AWS Athena. Tableau additionally connects to Snowflake and Databricks. This enables dashboards to be created and refreshed with the latest data from across the business, including POS, email, mobile, and SMS. It also means there's just one source of truth so that everyone can collaborate around the same data. For example, each team has a dashboard to monitor their own KPIs and KPIs shared across the business. They can also come together to explore the data, whether to uncover new insights or make predictions. Heng said that adoption had been easy because of employees' demand for data and because Tableau was intuitive to use. \"We no longer have different versions of spreadsheets flying around. Every single employee is using Tableau as their source of truth,\" said Heng. Punchh is also using Tableau to meet the needs of its customers. Custom dashboards complement the reporting and insights generated by its products and enable the business to be more responsive to individual customer requests. For example, Punchh's analysts can create a new dashboard in Tableau in as little as four hours, whereas before, web developers had to be brought in for data visualization. Depending on the complexity, the creation of a dashboard previously took anywhere from a couple of days to several weeks. Punchh is also using Tableau to prototype new products. In the past, the company would come up with a new concept and appoint a web developer to design a minimum viable product. Now, analysts can do this themselves in Tableau. Punchh began using Tableau four years ago, starting with Tableau Server. It has since transitioned to Tableau Cloud, which has given it the flexibility to scale while eliminating time spent managing upgrades and server capacity. The company has also benefited from the use of Tableau Extracts which has increased the speed and ease of working with large data sets. In particular, Punchh has experienced a 40% to 70% increase in performance by using Tableau Extracts to power live dashboards in its production environment. The additional speed has been beneficial during the pandemic, as Punchh has been inundated with customer requests for new data insights. \"For these once-in-a-lifetime events, you can't rely on conventional thinking. You need to get innovative and start asking different questions,\" said Heng. \"The trust and speed of data have been more important than ever during this time.\""

        "content": "Identifying and investigating fraudulent claims is extremely time consuming for many insurance companies. In 2017, there were approximately \u20ac13bn of detected and undetected fraudulent claims in Europe. These claims take valuable time away from insurers who need to treat genuine claims and serve customers quickly and efficiently. However, many insurance companies are stuck with disparate data sources, legacy systems and many employees working manually, making the ability to identify and weed out fraudulent claims extremely difficult. Anadolu Sigorta was founded in 1925 under the leadership of Isbank, Turkey's first national bank. Today it is Turkey\u2019s first national insurance company, employing over 1,200 staff and offering a wide range of non-life policies to customers throughout the country. Anadolu Sigorta is on a mission to implement a customer-focused approach to service, deliver new products and create a more efficient way to spot fraudulent claims - using data. In short, they have put data at the core of their innovation strategy. Here, Vedat Gunes, BI & Analytical Applications Manager at Anadolu Sigorta, shares how the company has transformed into a fully data-driven organisation, predicated on a powerful data culture where employees are developing business strategies and making decisions, based on data. Data has always played a big role in the insurance industry, for the underwriting process of policies and assessment of customers, but now it\u2019s at the very heart of the company, driving everything we do. All of our new business strategies and plans are now built on data, while prediction-based applications are being used to open new doors all the time from an operational perspective. In addition, we developed a social network platform to identify organized fraud cases and served it to our claim department usage and also we replaced our central fraud platform with inhouse developed fraud application and integrated to organized fraud detection application. We\u2019re creating a more accurate 360\u00b0 customer view, which in turn enables us to optimise pricing, develop new product offerings and put more meaningful KPIs in place like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), health anomaly metrics, and campaign predictions parameters. The main challenge is the efficient preparation and modelling of data. As a 95-year-old company, we had many legacy systems and applications throughout the business, creating a fragmented ecosystem that was extremely hard to work with. In many cases, we had two or three different production environments for the same process, which we were combine together in our unified data model on our data warehouse before attempting to extract insights. This led to problems with data quality and reliability, as well as effective governance, all of which needed to be resolved in order to achieve our data transformation goals which are shortening data preparation step for analytics and visualization, faster time to market, and simpler integration process to operational systems We also needed to overcome some cultural challenges. Many of our employees and external distributors were accustomed to working with list-based reports, so were resistant to change when it came to modern data visualization trends. Firstly, we\u2019re much more comfortable sharing insights with business users now, using highly visual, interactive Tableau dashboards, which enables them to explore their data with ease. Rather than trying to input everything into our data warehouse first, we can combine multiple data sources directly through Tableau and visualise it all together in a single dashboard, greatly improving the data quality and reliability in the process. Employees and customers know they can trust the data when using it to inform key decisions. Furthermore, Tableau\u2019s extensive suite of security tools gives us tight control over the data from a governance perspective. Once our employees and customers started to use Tableau, they quickly fell in love with it, leading to a rapid cultural shift that we thought would take a lot longer to achieve. We see an increasing number of business units adopting Tableau to improve their own business processes from business development to fraud prevention. Now all of our distribution channels use Tableau over legacy dashboard platform, which was Qlickview. We also use Tableau embedded analytics to distribute key data to over 4,500 insurance agents around Turkey. Tableau\u2019s automated report functionality means they have round-the-clock access to the latest customer details, claims information and product lists, all updated on a daily basis. Using the agency portal, greatly reducing the demand on our central BI and analytics team here. We are serving all visuals related with central fraud platform to our internal users with Tableau dashboards. We can say Tableau is the GUI of our fraud application. Users can consume all fraud related information via Tableau platform. Key data sets such as claims made, frequency of claims, transactional data and provisions can all be combined and analysed together in a single Tableau dashboard. Rather than relying on tables, employees can ask questions of the data and explore the insights they are uncovering. This makes identifying anomalies and marking them for further investigation much more efficient, which has dramatically cut fraudulent claims going unchallenged. Identify and use one platform to consolidate all your data! Also, make sure you consider all business users and their needs. Getting input from a wide range of people at an early stage will help avoid resistance further down the line. The IT department isn\u2019t doing data transformation for itself, but the chances of success will be much higher if everyone is on board from the start."

The Finnish company supports 2,500+ customers across more than 175 countries, with net sales topping \u20ac151 million in 2020. Basware uses Tableau embedded analytics to power its Basware Analytics solution, which gives customers a complete overview of their financial data, from procurement-to-payment (P2P), via a single, central platform. The resulting insights enable them to make faster, more informed decisions and streamline payment processes, delivering an average return on investment (ROI) of 315 percent. Basware\u2019s innovative P2P solution consolidates and automates finance and procurement functions across large IT environments, providing 100 percent visibility to customers on where their spend is going and exactly who they are doing business with. \u201cThe majority of our customers are multinational organisations with over $500 million in revenues a year,\u201d says Perttu Nihti, Chief Product Officer, Basware. \u201cThe large-scale nature of their operations means their data landscapes have become increasingly fragmented over time. This, combined with high external spend and invoice volumes, makes it harder and harder for them to maintain a comprehensive view of operations, or uncover key insights hidden within their data.\u201d By centralising their systems through Basware\u2019s P2P suite, customers can once again achieve the oversight they need to optimise operational efficiency, with key insights delivered via Basware Analytics, powered by Tableau. Basware Analytics is fully integrated into Basware\u2019s P2P suite, utilising Tableau embedded analytics to provide customers with vital business intelligence in key operational areas. These include \u2018spend insights\u2019, which break down current spending and help build high performance supply chains, \u2018process insights\u2019, which identify process inefficiencies and bottlenecks, and \u2018financial insights\u2019, which enable accurate forecasting of committed spend. Customers can also view the impact of invoicing activity on their carbon footprint and receive data driven recommendations for how to reduce it. \u201cA recent total economic impact analysis found that our P2P solution has an average payback time of just 11 months, with ROI in the region of 315 percent,\u201d notes Perttu. \u201cThis would be impossible to achieve without 100 percent visibility on both spending and processes, which further emphasises the power of embedded analytics and the huge impact it has on our customers\u2019 businesses.\u201d The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it more important than ever for organisations to know exactly who they are doing business with. This includes everything from finding new opportunities and optimising spending to negotiating contracts and establishing strong relationships with suppliers. Having complete visibility of both direct and indirect spending is fundamental to all of this, making accurate analytics essential. Recent features to be added include a \u2018payment performance analysis\u2019 dashboard, which lets customers analyse how long it takes to pay suppliers and identify/resolve any unnecessary delays. New \u2018committed spend analytics\u2019 also enables customers to build predictive capabilities for spend, including purchase orders, standing orders, invoices and more. All of this is curated through a single Tableau dashboard, providing a unified view that helps finance teams understand their ongoing currency exposure and cash reserve needs. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace, which means we need to be constantly looking ahead and finding innovative new ways to give our customers a competitive edge,\u201d concludes Perttu. \u201cOur partnership with Tableau allows us to do this every day, giving us the differentiator we need to remain the leading e-procurement solution in the world."

        "company": "University of Kentucky ",
        "content": "Colleges have a mission to prepare students for jobs in the real world. The University of Kentucky (UKY) had business and accounting programs ranging from introductory to advanced levels, but received feedback from recruiters that many graduates were lacking basic data skills needed for careers in the modern marketplace. A visionary dean at the school mandated a new data analytics program that would better position students for workplace success. But implementing the program meant overcoming certain hurdles. As a public university in a mostly rural state, UK faced barriers both real and perceived when engaging students on new technologies. Many attendees were in the first generation of their families to achieve higher education, and were later in adopting technical concepts due to lack of exposure. Along with this came a confidence problem\u2014a hesitancy to invest time learning a skill because the students couldn\u2019t picture the type of job where it would be valuable. The university needed to address these barriers and engage students in ways that would build confidence and make them stand out in a competitive job market. UKY built out a new curriculum using Tableau as a central teaching tool. The university started small, with a 4-week Tableau module in an elective course, but over 18 months the program blossomed in classrooms throughout the business school and beyond. Today, introductory courses in data analytics enroll more than 500 students per semester, while advanced classes teach data mining, modeling, and management. This expansion has led to developing an undergraduate minor program in Data Analytics, as well as integration with graduate programs such as the Master of Business Administration and Master of Public Health. The Tableau Desktop Specialist certification has also been a valuable asset. UK students can take this exam as soon as they complete the introductory data analytics course, and adding it to their resumes shows recruiters they have a proven proficiency in tackling data analytics concepts and bringing them to life through Tableau visualizations. For many students, Desktop Specialist also provides their first experience taking an online remote-proctored certification exam, helping to build their confidence for similar forms of future on-the-job training. Dan Stone, PhD, Director of Minor in Business Analytics & Rosenthal Endowed Chair shared that \u201cthe Desktop Specialist Exam has been a powerful and accessible achievement credential for our students.\u201d When Tableau first released the certification exam, more than 80% of the students in the data visualization classes took it, and most passed. Tableau and the Desktop Specialist exam continue giving students the exposure and confidence they need to keep pace with market expectations and develop the skills today's recruiters want to see. Dan\u2019s team began tracking the words in student resumes and found that \u201cTableau\u201d, \u201cdata visualization\u201d, \u201canalytics\u201d, and \u201cdata modeling\u201d were showing up much more frequently. \u201cWe now have recruiters from Silicon Valley and from tech companies who are coming to University of Kentucky for the first time, and our graduates are entering leadership roles at an earlier age than we ever would have expected,\u201d said Dan.  Modernizing its curriculum has helped UKY transform as an institution with a data-focused mindset. The university plans on rolling out more analytics training in its undergraduate and graduate business courses, and faculty are finding new ways for visualization platforms like Tableau to illuminate and expand their research activities."

        "company": "Prospitalia h-trak",
        "content": "Prospitalia h-trak was founded in 2002 to help healthcare providers capture and manage their data for purchasing, billing, and reporting. The company\u2019s flagship product is h-trak which allows customers to gather critical data at the point of care, including details of any consumables used during surgery. Combined with h-trak\u2019s powerful and flexible reporting capabilities, this helps hospitals and other healthcare providers manage their inventory and streamline administration. \u201cData is at the cornerstone of everything we do and key to the service we provide our customers,\u201d said Kirk Kikirekov, Managing Director of Prospitalia h-trak. \u201cThere are more than 1.4 million products used in critical care environments such as pacemakers and knee implants. Our customers need accurate information on how much they cost and how much insurers will pay. They also need to track and analyze how much they are consuming and spending, so they can be as cost-efficient as possible,\u201d Kikirekov continued. A new solution from Prospitalia h-trak helps to deliver these insights in real-time. Known as h-control, the solution leverages embedded analytics from Tableau to help customers reduce spending by as much as 10%. With h-control, Prospitalia h-trak wanted to provide the industry with a level of insight not possible with any other reporting tool. To achieve this, the company needed a solution that would allow it to take the data within h-trak and make it easier for customers to explore and quickly spot things like variations in spending, spending trends, and contract compliance. A previous analytics solution used by Prospitalia h-trak required too much coding to extend visualizations to customers. Tableau offered a flexible alternative with local support for the Australian business. \u201cAnother thing we liked about Tableau is that the visualizations you can create are quite powerful,\u201d said Kikirekov. \u201cIt gave us an opportunity to re-imagine the story we are trying to make with data so that our dashboards are even more useful for our customers.\u201d Prospitalia h-trak has since streamlined the creation of dashboards using Tableau\u2019s embedded analytics platform. Kikirekov explained that every night, customer data was uploaded from h-trak by creating an XML file that\u2019s transferred to a database connected to Tableau. This allows for the automatic refresh of dashboards within the h control product. The onboarding process with the h-control product is also very simple. Prospitalia h-trak simply creates the user accounts for our customers on the h-control system and then carries out a one-to-two-hour training session with customers. Customers now have data at their fingertips to understand how much they\u2019re spending on different products and procedures and pinpoint opportunities to control costs. One local health district was able to use the insights gained to reduce costs by $7M, which was 9% of its annual spend on consumables and implants. \u201cProspitalia h-trak is deeply involved with our customers on an ongoing basis, and we partner with them to provide continual advice and insights to improve their understanding of their data, and therefore improve their business,\u201d said Kikirekov. Prospitalia h-trak has hired an internal developer to build and enhance its dashboards and create new ones in response to customer needs. One of these was a dashboard to help a local health district track Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The customer had initially tracked PPE within a spreadsheet, but by using Tableau, it was easier to visualize supply and ensure items were reordered before they ran out. \u201cThe demand for PPE was 10x higher than it had ever been and there was a lot of nervousness about running out. The dashboard helped to alleviate the customer\u2019s concerns and ensure demand was met,\u201d said Kikirekov. Prospitalia h-trak is now investigating how it can apply data to help customers optimize and standardize their contracts. Tableau\u2019s embedded analytics platform will help to power this solution and uncover more opportunities for health care providers to maximize their volume-based contracts. Moving forward, Kikirekov would also like to help customers be more proactive and use their data for scenario planning. \u201cA lot of what we do is based on historical data, but we now want to use historical data to predict the future by modelling scenarios to enable better forecasting and planning,\u201d said Kikirekov."

As an innovative market leader in the hyper-connected era Invites Healthcare offers tailored digital healthcare management services, smart medical systems and solutions, and data-based clinical trial support for both B2B and B2C operations. Key services include Care8 DNA, a custom healthcare platform based on genetic testing, and Coach-coach Diabetes, a diabetes management app service, and focus is on improving customers\u2019 personalized health checkups and diagnosis capabilities. Through strategic partnerships with Korean and international medical institutions, Invites Healthcare provides services for integrated management of previously decentralized health data. Invites Healthcare naturally faces the challenge of aggregating health data containing sensitive customer information and analyzing large volumes of data to understand and analyze market topography. R&D Center manager Dongwook Nam told us, \u201cWe create dashboards displaying genetic information of many users and share it across the company as part of our efforts to improve customer experience. We use Tableau\u2019s visual data analysis tool for business intelligence (BI), which allows us to provide services in fundamental target marketing, marketing inflow, and genetic signature analysis.\u201d Prior to the introduction of Tableau, Invites Healthcare employees had to use an inordinate amount of time in preparing visualized reports, as data was decentralized across 10 different channels. Employees required a self-serviceable, coding-free business intelligence (BI) tool that could easily leverage data for insights and could share results across the company to enable timely data-driven decisions. Invites Healthcare introduced Tableau in sync with Care8 DNA launched in September last year. \u2018Tableau Basic Training\u2019 and online training sessions allowed working-level employees to leverage all of Tableau dashboard capabilities and produce customer insight in real-time.  In addition, by fostering a data-sharing corporate culture, all business divisions of Invites Healthcare had instant access to the data analysis reports produced by the R&D department, ready to be used for business operations. Ho-Chang Sun, VP of Invites Healthcare shared, \u201cPrior to the introduction of Tableau, we had to manually connect to servers, and the data generated from multiple channels was difficult to view at a glance. Tableau decreased weekly report turnaround time and presented the overall business status on a single visual dashboard, improving executives\u2019 satisfaction. Based on the experiences gained from previous deployments of Tableau in other businesses, the executives at Invites Healthcare considered introducing Tableau from the early stages of business. The outstanding features of Tableau were leveraged to improve data management capabilities, bolster security for sensitive customer health data, and build a reliable and trustworthy digital healthcare platform.  The Invites Healthcare marketing department, in particular, monitors on the Tableau dashboard in real time data Google Analytics, Naver Keyword Ads, Facebook and Instagram, and various other marketing channels and bases its marketing strategies on the analytic results. Hee-Sun Choi, a manager at Invites Healthcare shared that, \u201cThe online marketing advertising performance measured through Tableau-based automated reporting is helping us make quick decisions.\u201d The global proliferation of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has raised interest in health and well-being, and, by extension, digital healthcare. As current circumstances severely limit in-person contact, keeping accurate track of customer information collected online, purchase, and feedback all require rapid organization of data to improve existing services and develop new ones. Tableau\u2019s dashboard and its data-visualization has played a major role. Invites Healthcare uses Tableau dashboard feature to generate customer gene distribution charts based on Care8 DNA, a platform for tailored health management based on genetic testing. Furthermore, Invites Healthcare designated a biweekly Data Day to regularly provide newsletters containing the company\u2019s output of genetic data and relevant public data. Since this information was provided, the number of comments under the content posts increased by about 300%, confirming great customer interest in the data. Eunyoung Lee, manager in the Marketing Department at Invites Healthcare stated, \u201cTableau\u2019s interactive analytics dashboard allows us to measure marketing effectiveness in a timely manner, and this has enabled us to deliver customized newsletters to our customers with meaningful insights about their genetic data.\u201d"

        "content": "Engie is the leading French supplier of natural gas and green electricity. Its solutions are targeted at residential customers, local government authorities, business, and industry. The group has 160,000 employees worldwide. It has decided to speed up its transition to a carbon-neutral economy through more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solutions. In order to fully capitalize on all its data assets and to provide its customers with even greater efficiency, ENGIE wanted to take its data-centric approach even further. In 2018, after competitive tendering by the leaders in the data visualization market, the group chose Tableau, attracted by the capabilities of its solution, both from a technical and ergonomic point of view. From now on, with the help of all its employees, ENGIE\u2019s residential customer division in France will rely on data to make decisions and manage the group\u2019s business. Previously, ENGIE\u2019s residential customer division had a set of management tools at its disposal. But it did not have sufficiently intuitive and interactive dashboards to monitor solutions and projects in real time and to measure customer satisfaction. This type of dashboard is key for improving the digital journey of customers, identifying anomalies, and adjusting the way they are targeted through a multi-channel approach. In the absence of dedicated software, the data visualizations, which are essential for monitoring these indicators and making decisions, were performed on a case-by-case basis through JavaScript. Using Tableau has enabled the development cycle of a visualization to be reduced from three months to two weeks. For example, thanks to Tableau, ENGIE\u2019s residential customer division was able to quickly develop a valuable tool that could even be utilized by employees who are not data experts. In a single visualization, it presents an overview of the customer solutions, with access to all the figures associated with each solution. With a single dashboard, it is possible, for example, to visualize the types of customers (including socio-demographic data) and how each solution is positioned in relation to a particular population (in terms of sales, churn, renewal, etc.). As a result of this speed-up, three dashboards are now produced each month compared to two per year prior to using Tableau. Today, rapid analysis and visualization allow a better understanding of data; no project is launched without its data visualization component in Tableau. Even without technical expertise, the various project stakeholders (product manager, team leader, etc.) are able to carry out their own analyses independently. The reporting team is less overloaded and is able to deliver the expected studies/dashboards more quickly. The take-up rate for Tableau is very high. The initial three-year license purchase plan was achieved in one year, and the 260 users planned for 2020 were achieved in 2019. Today, almost 400 employees use Tableau on a daily basis. Today, rapid analysis and visualization allow a better understanding of data; no project is launched without its data visualization component in Tableau. Even without technical expertise, the various project stakeholders (product manager, team leader, etc.) are able to carry out their own analyses independently. Almost 400 employees use Tableau on a daily basis. The objective of ENGIE\u2019s residential customer division in France was to accelerate the growth of \u201cDIY.\u201d Mission accomplished. Initially, it was the reporting team that got to grips with the tool and taught itself how to use it. Then, easy access to the data was extended to advanced users in all the divisions. Now, they can create their own data visualizations entirely by themselves. This phase has enabled a catalog of dashboards to be created. A dataset dedicated to each activity (marketing campaigns, sales, relationships, etc.) is available for each team. Through exchanges and sharing with their peers, analysts are able to increase their skills, a prerequisite for capitalizing on all the possibilities offered by the Tableau solution. Although Tableau is an extremely advanced reporting tool, every employee must be convinced of the value that the company can derive from the data. They must also share a common culture on this subject. To facilitate this development, ENGIE\u2019s residential customer division has instituted communication and awareness-raising activities, particularly in the form of hackathons, to introduce the tool to users. For example, a DataViz Day was organized with Tableau\u2019s assistance, consisting of workshops and self-service areas where employees were able to experiment with the tool. The teams also have access to a data-oriented telephone hotline. \u201cImplementation of the Tableau solution has brought us many benefits. Every employee can now capitalize on the data to monitor the solutions, contracts sent to customers, signed documents returned, closing deadlines, and customer satisfaction. This approach is possible as a result of the implementation of a controlled and structured framework, with data prepared in advance and rules that enable their use to be put in context,\u201d explains Ahmed Zaidi, Reporting Team Manager at Engie."

        "company": "Dairy Farm Group",
        "content": "DFI Retail Group is a leading pan-Asian retailer which operates over 10,000 outlets, including grocery stores, convenience stores, health and beauty stores, and home furnishings stores. In 2019, DFI Retail Group turned to Tableau for an effective way to analyze the performance of its stores.  In order to drive consistency and performance across stores, there is a need to measure performance for each store.  It became too difficult to track and analyze all these within spreadsheets. Extracting insights took hours and days and required expertise using spreadsheet formulas.  The size of data sets was also an issue and meant that files sometimes failed to load. Seeking an alternative to spreadsheets, DFI Retail Group chose Tableau because it would allow employees to visualize and interact with their data and reduce the time spent on data analysis. It was also user friendly, meaning that employees could get started with Tableau relatively quickly. \u201cBased on our evaluation of different options, Tableau was the best fit for our needs due to cost, performance, and ease of use for end-users,\u201d said Eu Kwang Chin, IT Director at DFI Retail Group. For DFI Retail Group, there were three key components in building a strong DATA CULTURE. The first was support from management which included investment in the right technology as well as investment in time for employees to build and learn new skills. The second was an open-minded approach from business users who readily embraced opportunities to apply data insights to their daily activities. Finally, there was a team of \u201cbridge builders\u201d who helped to drive training and other enablement activities within DFI Retail Group.  Enablement activities included fortnightly Fast Start Workshops to bring new users onto Tableau. DFI Retail Group then held more frequent Advanced Workshops to enable power users.  To further support adoption, DFI Retail Group established templates for routine reporting and analysis. They also participated in a Tableau Data Doctor session where they had the opportunity to seek help with specific problems. This led to enhancements like faster load time for dashboards, helping DFI Retail Group optimize its use of Tableau.   DFI Retail Group was supported in its adoption journey by Tableau\u2019s Customer Success team. The team helped to orchestrate enablement activities based on the Tableau Blueprint which offers a step-by-step guide to becoming a data-driven organization. Tableau is now firmly embedded into the business, with adoption growing from 56 users to more than 400 in just over six months.   DFI Retail Group now has automated dashboards to analyze trading activities across markets, including sales and profit. The dashboards have reduced time spent on routine reporting and equipped employees to focus on more value added work, including business strategy and interactions with stakeholders. Employees can also drill down into the data in just a few clicks and get a comprehensive view of how each store, department, category, and even product is performing. \u201cEveryone in the team can now access the same insights, from anywhere, at any time. It helps team members to better prepare for their meetings with stakeholders and also allows management to pinpoint issues or opportunities and react quickly with a consistent set of numbers,\u201d said Eu Kwang Chin. DFI Retail Group credits the visualization capabilities of Tableau for helping it quickly tackle business problems. For example, when analyzing decreases in sales performance for a particular store, business metrics can be presented in a way to easily show which categories or brands have contributed to the change. Outliers or anomalies in the data can also be highlighted. In 2020, DFI Retail Group launched its own brand of products to sell in its grocery and convenience stores. The brand, known as Meadows offers great value to customers with high quality products at extremely competitive low prices. DFI Retail Group is using Tableau to provide visibility of business performance, thereby driving penetration of this brand to provide more value to customers.  The dashboards are highly visual with good use of charts and colours so that it is easy to identify call outs and discussion points. For example, management can easily see drop in penetration rate from one month to the next. They can then drill down into the underlying data in a few clicks to understand the contributing factors. These insights ultimately enable them to quickly adjust pricing or make other decisions to get sales and profits back on track. DFI Retail Group\u2019s adoption journey with Tableau has been positive and it continues to see strong momentum with new users coming on board and adding data literacy to their skillsets. There is also increasing consolidation and standardization of business performance dashboards across the group. Management and team members also have increasing visibility of business performance, with less reliance on external consultants. \u201cIn the past, there\u2019s always challenges to get the right data, organize them, and then putting in reports for analysis at speed. Business has struggled with getting the right insights timely. With Tableau, we can build fit for purpose dashboard/report visualization solutions that enable teams to perform. Digitalization is already accelerated due to COVID-19, and data platforms such as Tableau enables a data-driven way of working that allows us to adapt, adjust, and respond to a rapidly changing market,\u201d said Eu Kwang Chin."

Splunk uses SaaS based Enterprise Data Warehouse solution powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to acquire, integrate, organize data from multiple business applications. Historically, Splunk has used Tableau Server as the visualization engine for creating easy-to-use, filterable dashboards that allow internal teams to examine all analytics. Adoption of Tableau was so fast at Splunk that it soon proved difficult for server capacity and performance to keep up with the rate of growth. Splunk wanted to reduce server administrative burdens (like software upgrades, security patches, and so on) across all of its platforms and properties, including not just Tableau, but Linux and Amazon Web Services as well. As a cloud-first, fully software-as-a-service company themselves, Splunk knew the benefits of a cloud-based product like Tableau Cloud (powered by AWS) was an attractive solution to ease their scalability woes.     \u201cCentralizing and eliminating administrative tasks was a key driver for our migration,\u201d says Raj Seenu, Senior Director of Data Technologies at Splunk. \u201cIn the case of Tableau Cloud, we no longer have to designate an IT Ops person or data engineer to manage the platform\u2014those experts can now spend more time on other activities.\u201d By migrating to Tableau Cloud, Splunk not only decreased these administrative inefficiencies for its visualization workflows, but also greatly increased the speed and scale of its data processing, thanks to the compatibility of Tableau Cloud with AWS and various architectural improvements the team made to streamline data operations. \u201cWith Tableau Cloud,\u201d says Seenu, \u201cwe're now saving more than $300,000 per year in server and platform administration costs over the previous Tableau Server-based solution, and our dashboard performance has improved by a factor of 2x.\u201d Splunk kept its Tableau Cloud migration orderly and efficient by using a straightforward, four-step process: The entire migration happened over two days, with zero downtime as users were connected to the old platform right up to the time the new one was ready. At the end of the migration, Splunk designed and followed strict protocols and best practices for ongoing governance of the new cloud-based platform, including checklists, certifications, role-based data access, and a Center of Excellence to help the Splunk community with questions and issues related to adoption. \u201cSetting up user governance is key to a successful project, whether it's a migration or starting from scratch,\u201d says Adrian Rios, Senior Business Intelligence Analyst at Splunk. \u201cOur migration to Tableau Cloud benefited greatly from having a thoughtful, easy-to-execute governance model to work with.\u201d Migration has led to other benefits, as well. Cross-domain identity management and multifactor authentication capabilities in Tableau Cloud enable enhanced data access and security, and the roadmap includes plans to integrate Tableau reporting with the company's Salesforce CRM. Meanwhile, Splunk continues to gain solidarity and credibility with its customers by prioritizing its investment in cloud technologies\u2014a credo Splunk is always advising to them as a modern best practice. \u201cHaving Tableau in the cloud like our other properties is a real asset for us,\u201d says Seenu. \u201cWe get all the benefits of scalability and hands-off administration, and it demonstrates to our customers that we truly are cloud-first.\u201d"

        "title": "Vend makes Tableau its trusted source of truth",
        "company": "Vend",
        "content": "Founded in 2010, Vend is a cloud-based Point-of-Sale (POS) and retail management software company that helps retailers manage and grow their business. The software is used by retailers in over 100 countries, managing inventory, and rewarding customer loyalty. The software also provides retailers with real-time reporting, helping them make smarter decisions. Michelle Blyde, Business Intelligence Manager at Vend, shared that Vend takes a data-led approach to decision-making wherever possible, like its retailers. Blyde added, \u201cMost of our strategic decisions are made using the data we have within Tableau. We know the data is clean, up-to-date, and can be trusted, which is imperative to our business.\u201d Vend first began using Tableau over four years ago. In the time since it has come to serve as the main source of truth for the company\u2019s key business metrics. It\u2019s also improved the timeliness and accessibility of the data used for decision-making. Vend\u2019s Business Intelligence (BI) team is responsible for enabling management and other key stakeholders with data to make decisions and manage performance. Initially, the team used Tableau to generate dashboards and insights on-demand, reacting to requests from stakeholders. However, the approach meant that decision-makers lacked access to information like finance KPIs. It also meant the BI team was spending a lot of their time on reactive reporting instead of working on higher-value initiatives. Vend decided to create one key metric dashboard for all stakeholders, which was refreshed daily, making data accessible near real-time. This includes finance, sales, customer, and data pulled in from Chargify, Salesforce, and Vend\u2019s own software. \u201cIn the past, each team had their own dashboards and reports, and there were disagreements about which numbers were correct. Tableau has helped us solve that problem by establishing one source of truth everyone can use to monitor business performance,\u201d said Blyde. The key metric dashboard makes it easy for users to visualise performance. They can also use filters to drill down into the details and get a better sense of what\u2019s happening behind the numbers. This level of self-sufficiency is built into dashboards created by the BI team, so users can explore their own data and have confidence in what the numbers are telling them. The COVID-19 pandemic created a lot of uncertainty for Vend and its customers, and the company has had to lean into its data to monitor and minimise the impacts. A set of COVID-19 dashboards was created early on to help Vend understand what was happening in each market and make data-driven decisions, rather than relying on gut feel. For instance, it was able to identify retailers who needed support and forecast the financial impacts of providing fee relief. Hannah Bartley, Commercial Analyst at Vend, said, \u201cWith Tableau, we\u2019ve been able to easily track things like which retailers are in lockdown and which are open, but experiencing much lower turnover. We\u2019ve then used this data to provide coupons and relief to those who\u2019ve needed it the most.\u201d Equipped with these insights, Vend has been able to navigate the pandemic with greater confidence. It\u2019s also built up goodwill with customers while carefully managing the risks of the business. Tableau helped us navigate the effects of the pandemic on our retailers in a clear and concise manner with all available metrics in one place. The adoption of Tableau has grown with a number of employees proactively requesting access to view the key metrics dashboard and others. There\u2019s also more collaboration around data, with teams having frequent conversations using the data presented in Tableau. \u201cI think there was a real desire before to collaborate around data, and we can do that now. We can come together in our weekly meetings and ask questions of our data, like how\u2019s our gross revenue tracking and what\u2019s happening with customer churn,\u201d said Bartley. The next step in Vend\u2019s data journey is to increase the amount of real-time data flowing into Tableau so that it can get an up-to-the-minute, 360-degree view of its customers, including financial and product data. \u201cThe more information we have, the more we can understand our customers and drive positive outcomes for them and the business,\u201d said Blyde."

Its continuing investment in research and development has resulted in game-changing products, like fuel-efficient tires that enhance fuel economy. The corporate philosophy at Bridgestone guides the company in building better products and communities and includes a commitment to informed decision-making. This philosophy holds true for Bridgestone Sales Thailand. The company is the local trading business for Bridgestone, and it\u2019s been on a journey with Tableau and partner G-able to strengthen its data culture. Tableau has now replaced spreadsheets to allow teams across the business to understand their data better. In the past, teams were reliant on spreadsheets for data analysis. However, there were limitations to the analysis they could do and there was time wasted on consolidating data from different sources such as Bridgestone\u2019s ERP. \u201cLike many companies, we started out doing things very traditionally, but ultimately wanted a tool to help us do more advanced analytics. We evaluated several solutions, and Tableau was the one that met all of our requirements,\u201d said Khun Singhadet Chamnannak, IT Department Manager at Bridgestone Sales (Thailand). \u201cThe strong point of Tableau is that it\u2019s very dynamic and allows users to present their data on demand. So whenever management has a question, someone can go look at their dashboard and deliver the information quickly.\u201d Bridgestone partnered with G-able as it wanted a local expert to support the implementation and help drive adoption. Employees\u2019 natural instinct was to turn to spreadsheets every time they conducted analysis or completed a report. To bring them onboard Tableau, G-able conducted workshops and training to show them the benefits and help them learn how to use it. The initial phase of the implementation included the rollout of Tableau Desktop to the Resource Planning department and Finance team. These teams had previously been doing daily analysis in spreadsheets which made getting them onboard a key win. And now, they\u2019re championing Tableau and supporting other users across the business. Tableau Server has also now been introduced, allowing mobile teams like Sales to access insights from anywhere, at any time. One of the benefits of Tableau is that it can unify data from multiple sources, enabling Bridgestone to analyze and visualize its data all in one place. This includes data held in SAP and marketing and sales data held in CSV and Excel files. Time spent on daily analytics has been reduced by 50%, saving up to two and a half hours per day. In addition, the business\u2019 148 Tableau users can now collaborate around one single source of truth. They can also use the data to build and refresh their dashboards rather than needing to go to IT. Khun Singhadet Chamnannak shared that the result was better for everyone. \u201cBusiness users know their data and what it is that they need, whereas before IT would spend a lot of time gathering requirements and not always get it right,\u201d he said. One of the key data points tracked by Bridgestone is customer conversion from sales and marketing activities, and with Tableau, teams have been able to monitor this in real-time and identify opportunities to increase sales. For example, Bridgestone can easily see which SKUs are selling well in each region and use that data to refine their sales and marketing strategies. Bridgestone can also better forecast customer needs and make sure that it\u2019s producing the right products. Bridgestone is continuing to work with G-able and participating in Tableau community groups to build on these benefits using industry best practices. It wants to strengthen its data expertise and make it even easier for business users to self-serve and make sense of their own data. \u201cIf you want to lead the market, it\u2019s clear that data is a key success factor. The challenge is how to analyze data in the easiest and most meaningful way, and Tableau is the tool that will support us with that,\u201d said Khun Singhadet Chamnannak. "

        "title": "Tableau enables the BMW Group Germany to improve performance across its wholesale and retail business",
        "company": "BMW",
        "content": "The BMW brand is synonymous with automotive engineering excellence. Car enthusiasts and commuters around the world covet the famous blue and white badge as a symbol of luxury and quality. Each year, the company produces 2.5 million vehicles, making it one of the largest commercial enterprises in Germany. At its national wholesale and retail business in Germany, Tableau is used to inform sales and marketing strategies, drive conversations with dealerships and exceed KPIs at both national and regional levels. Here, Saagar Weth, Data Analytics Team Leader at the BMW Group Germany, discusses the critical importance of data consistency across the enterprise and how the introduction of Tableau transformed the way employees work with data every day. We work with many different data sources and multiple databases, as well as in-house systems. Before Tableau it was more complicated to collate, analyse and visualise information from these different data sources effectively. Employees were conducting their own siloed analytics and reporting, which could sometimes lead to data discrepancies. For this reason, two years ago our senior leadership team decided to create a new way of working, unifying all of these disparate data systems through a single intuitive analytics platform. One that not only supported a 360 degree view and data driven decision making, but also enabled cross functional synergies between different teams within the company, helping them to collaborate more effectively. The back-end infrastructure was super important, and we spent a lot of time getting this right. Tableau was installed as the overarching visual analytics solution, linking everything together. Tableau enables employees to find insights whenever required and analyse the exact same information as everyone else, displayed in a series of well governed, highly visual dashboards. As a result, data throughout the business is more consistent. Tableau\u2019s automation features were key for us. Once a dashboard has been created, it never needs to be manually updated again. New data is automatically pulled from different data sources, which means users can always analyse the latest information whenever they open it up. Aspects like KPI report building now works much faster. We now have more time to build and implement new data strategies, ask questions, and discover important new insights that would otherwise have remained hidden. Ease of use was also a big factor. Tableau enables people without a data background to pick it up very quickly and we get a lot of comments about how clean the dashboards look, which makes analysis extremely simple and intuitive to perform. Like every leadership team, our senior executives need to closely track KPIs. Now, KPIs are contained in a single automated dashboard that allows them to drill down into any measure they like, by car model, sales period, region and more, with outliers automatically highlighted in red. Using dynamic filtering in Tableau rather than static tables and charts means that questions can be asked and answered on the spot during meetings, instead of taken away to be answered later. It completely changes the dynamic of these meetings - where conversation focuses on why something is happening, not what. This leads to better, more informed decision making, and much faster business response to market trends and challenges, which is critical in the current climate. It\u2019s had a massive impact. In less than two years, Tableau usage has grown from nothing to more than 60 percent of our workforce in Germany. Furthermore, the insights generated are being used to make better decisions at every level of the enterprise, as well as spark new conversations with our dealers. For example, we\u2019ve recently created a dealer steering dashboard in Tableau based on peer to peer performance in different regional markets across Germany. This helps us pinpoint where our best performing dealers are and understand the key factors in their success. We can then share this knowledge with other dealers on an aggregated regional and sub-regional level, in order to help them improve their performance as well. Analysing data is imperative to any forward-thinking business, but without a coherent data strategy, you can quickly get lost. Tableau can assist and support you in your data transformation efforts, which makes it so important. It\u2019s both easy to use and provides deep insights. These benefits, combined with invaluable automation features, will quickly set you on the path towards becoming a fully data driven business."

        "company": "Konica Minolta Japan",
        "content": "Background to deployment In August of 2003, Konica Minolta Holdings, Inc. is established by integrating the management of Konica Corporation (established in 1873) and Minolta Co., Ltd. (established in 1928). The years that followed can be said to be ones of change. In 2006, they withdrew from their respective founding businesses, the photo and camera, and drastically altered its business structure. In 2013, the holding company absorbed the seven operating companies, and became Konica Minolta, Inc. Konica Minolta is now expanding its digital workplace, professional printing, healthcare, and industry businesses. More than 40 thousand employees in approximately 150 countries work in these businesses. The company is also actively engaged in DX. In 2018, Konica Minolta established its Business Process Transformation Division, using digital technology to transform business processes. Moreover, beginning in 2020 and based on its \"DX2022\" medium-term business strategy, the company will transform its business model from a product-centric business to one focused on high-value-added businesses through DX. Konica Minolta's DX efforts have been well received externally, and the company has also been selected for the \"DX Companies 2020\" by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Japan). \"Our goals for DX are to provide sustainable value by looking at possible future social issues for 2030 and working back from there to define customer values, which we then use as a starting point to strengthen our intangible assets and enhance the competitive strength of our business,\" explains Yuji Ichimura, who, as an executive officer and CIO/CSO at Konica Minolta, is responsible for Digital Transformation, DX Brand Communication and Public Relations. He states that in order to do this, Konica Minolta is using a raft of technologies and business models to transform the entire group. \"We are willing to do away with existing organizations and processes and rebuild from scratch.\" One of these efforts is the \"visualization\" of management data. \"We used to rely principally on Excel to collect and analyze management data, and doing so required an enormous amount of work,\" recalls Yukihiro Imaizumi, group leader of the Transformation Promotion Department at Konica Minolta's Business Process Transformation Division. He says that creating documents for management meetings took several days. \"Because of that, data would already be out of date when we held our management meetings and making decisions in a timely manner was difficult.\" Ichimura also points out that \"By the time we received such data, the situation on the ground had already changed.\" He says that they would regularly issue instructions to the field based on old data, ultimately resulting in confusion. Tableau deployment / operating environment Tableau is used to resolve these issues. It has become the standard data platform for the entire company, and activities to support its use are actively underway. As Tetsu Hosoki explains, \"Our standard approach is to hear the needs of the business divisions, offer a methodology suited to each, and then have each division actually use the data.\" Additionally, they actively cooperate with the division responsible for internal communications. Information on the use of Tableau has also been published in a series of in-house DX case studies authored by this division. \"We are expanding the use of Tableau through an optimal combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches,\" says Imaizumi. Activities such as these have borne fruit, with more than 500 people from each business unit participating in an internal Tableau-related event held in December 2020. Hundreds of dashboards have already been created.   Reasons for selecting Tableau Imaizumi and Hosoki explain that Tableau was selected as a standard data platform for three major reasons. The first is that it allows detailed data analyses to be performed with ease. The second is its high level of connectivity, which allows flexible data ingestion. The third is the comprehensive level of support aimed at gaining Tableau traction. Moreover, the 2020 announcement of plans to integrate with the \u201cEinstein Discovery\" (now CRM Analytics) AI functionality offered by Salesforce also served to encourage this decision, and the company anticipates that this will further accelerate the use of data.   Effects of deploying Tableau Using Tableau has the following effects Accelerating data use Tableau lets users cut down on the time required for data collection, analysis, and reporting, allowing timely use of data. \"Documents that used to take three days to put together can now be created in a matter of hours, and we can run our meetings from dashboards,\" says Imaizumi. Utilizing various types of data in combination  Importing and combining different types of data in Tableau has also simplified analysis tasks that had previously been difficult. One example given is the analysis of the correlation between the spread of the COVID-19 crisis and sales. The company is analyzing regional trends in work-related injuries, performing factorial analysis and more.     Future developments Going forward, Konica Minolta plans to build further on best practices for using Tableau and will proactively deploy and utilize \"Einstein Discovery.\" In September 2020, the Business Process Transformation Division started using Einstein Discovery and began deployment to improve sales productivity in key businesses. In 2021, the knowledge gained through these processes will be used to offer proposals to other business units in turn. Ichimura notes that \"Japanese companies have the advantage of being able to share tacit knowledge easily, and we anticipate that combining this with the power offered by data will allow us to demonstrate even greater strength.\" He explains that the visualization of management data is a powerful platform for sharing with actual workplaces the tacit knowledge that is the decision-making criteria used by managers, in a supportive manner. \"If we can achieve that, people in the field will be able to make the same decisions as those in management roles.\" The Japanese companies which are able to do this are also sure to be highly competitive in a global setting."

        "content": "Find out how Belcorp, a leader in the beauty and cosmetics segments in Latin America, redefined its corporate mindset, creating a solid data culture and investing in analytical training for each of its employees through its Data Academy. Empowering its various business areas with deep-seated analytical knowledge was one of the intended aims of the Data Academy, and Tableau was chosen as the visualization platform to head up the project and revolutionize decision-making in the corporation. Belcorp is a Peruvian company with a presence in 13 countries and earnings in excess of one billion dollars. Its purpose is \u201cTo boost beauty in order to achieve personal fulfillment\u201d, its target public is mainly female, and its leadership, headed up by CEO Erika Herrero Bettarel, highlights female empowerment \u2013 whether employees, independent consultants or consumers \u2013 as an important ingredient in the essence of its three brands: \u00c9sika, L\u2019Bel and Cyzone. Belcorp has undergone an evolution in recent years, with a full redesign of its Business Intelligence model. Tableau played a key part in this transformation, and contributed to the company\u2019s continuous two-digit annual growth.  The history of Belcorp and Tableau\u2019s partnership began in 2018, when the Data & Analytics department, bogged down with a huge demand for business cases, decided to search for solutions to empower its business areas and generate immediate responses to questions it formerly took weeks to attend to. The solution was to abandon the traditional BI model in favor of a tool that introduced the Self Service BI concept at Belcorp, a process aligned with the digital transformation already initiated by Venkat Gopalan, CTO & CDO (Chief Technology & Chief Digital Officer) of the company.  Venkat believes in the importance of a change in mindset and in the analytical skills of every individual in the organization, using technology as a facilitator and data analysis as the linchpin of this transformation. Returning to the conception of Belcorp\u2019s new BI model, in order to involve the business areas, right from the start of the process future users of the tool were called on to evaluate and select the new BI tool. \u201cIt was the first time in the history of Belcorp that the business area selected a tool\u201d, beams Lizeth Verano, Business Intelligence Manager. \u201cI want every single one of our Belcorp employees to have solid data analysis skills, and to adopt and promote them.\u201d - Erika Herrero, Belcorp CEO. \u201cVery quickly, we were able to decentralize our BI, offering a tool that enabled the areas to construct and personalize their own panels.\"\" We saved dozens of person hours making tables that used to require manual updates and which now update themselves, and practically in real time\u201d- says Lizeth.    As soon as Tableau was selected as the company\u2019s analytical platform, the Data & Analytics team embarked on a first wave of Tableau training with a group of select users, the Data Rockstars, with participants from all areas of the organization. Training commenced in Peru and created an interesting challenge for participants: those who finished the training in the shortest time, completing the exercises correctly, could apply to become instructors, and thus travel around the company\u2019s other offices across Latin America delivering training. An interesting personal opportunity to visit a new country, and a professional opportunity to include this experience on their resume. The strategy was a success and served to show that from now on, the business areas themselves would be responsible for establishing the analytical culture at Belcorp, promoting the data-driven mindset. With the scaling facilitated by Tableau, the increase in frequency of use and adoption of new ways of working for data analysis created new technical challenges for the team of Data Engineers, who had to completely rethink the data model and architecture in order to support and accompany this transformation at Belcorp.       In 2020, the world embarked on a change that took place at an impressive pace, with a hyper-acceleration towards a much more digital consumer and consultant with new needs, and the trends that we thought we would see in 3 to 5 years became reality in a matter of weeks and months.    Within the organization, we defined the Belcorp 2.0 strategy with ambitious goals that challenged us to explore new ideas swiftly and collaboratively. The digital and technological transformation demanded new skills of us, and this is why we launched Belcorp Academy, a training program focused on upskilling and reskilling, to improve and develop the key skills that will enable us to face the future successfully, quickly and flexibly. Priority was given to developing personalized experiences for consumers and consultants through data and analytics. This is how Belcorp Data Academy came into being, with the vision of leading the beauty industry as a company powered by Artificial Intelligence and data-based decisions. Belcorp Data Academy represents a change in mindset, behaviors and the ways we work. A project constructed under the sponsorship of Venkat (CTO & CDO) along with the Data & Analytics team and with the support of the Learning & Development team, to become the transformation Belcorp needs to successfully accomplish its strategy.  \u201cWe took on the challenge of designing an training offer with new strategies, measuring the learning results and promoting a change in the behavior of employees to ensure data-based decision-making. Evolving our traditional descriptive analyses, which only looked at the past, to predictive and prescriptive analyses, increasing the value we offer our consumers and consultants,\u201d Lizeth explains. The construction of Belcorp Data Academy was an intense, highly-detailed process that involved coaching sessions with more than three groups of external consultancy firms, the support of Tableau\u2019s Customer Success team and the influence of renowned cases in the industry. We weren\u2019t looking to reinvent the wheel. \u201cWe started by defining why it was important that everybody should be aware of the power of data, and to do so we defined a learning route that standardized the basic concepts of data analysis and artificial intelligence, which would be incorporated into our entire organization,\u201d adds Lizeth. Belcorp Data Academy was born with a very clear mission and set of values: \u201cEmpowering business people with technological skills that enable them to make decisions based on data, and doing so by providing them with the best analytics development program on the market.\u201d To achieve this mission, 5 gradual objectives were established: Understanding the value of data, promoting a data-based culture, mastering data analysis, mastering storytelling and mastering artificial intelligence. \u201cBased on these objectives, we designed the academy and its differentiating factors: personalized role-based learning path, alliance with leaders from the educational market, evaluation of learning with the KirkPatrick model and gamification strategy,\u201d  says Lizeth, adding: \u201cTo ensure the success of the implementation, we decided it was key to call on business allies who, along with the Data Rockstars, would be the main promoters of the initiative in their teams.\u201d These business allies work in collaboration with the Belcorp Data Academy team to ensure fulfillment of the indicators and guarantee that the goals and learnings are valuable for the entire organization.    The strategy was crafted on the basis of a pyramid with specific objectives and roles for each learning level. At the base of the pyramid are the Data Literate Consumers, business analysts who had little or no data knowledge until a short while ago. The aim of this role is to offer them the knowledge that would enable them to understand, analyze and obtain insights into the data, which will, in turn, enable us to ensure that all our strategies are aligned with our commercial results. The next, more specialist level, is that of the Data Rockstars, who are trained and offer technological tools such as: Tableau Desktop, access to Databases and Google Analytics, enabling responses to commercial questions and creating dashboards to enable automated, faster decision-making.  The Data Rockstars also have the role of creating new dashboards to improve operations in their business unit, enabling them to focus on the creation of new commercial strategies. Then we have the Storyteller role, whose objective is to narrate and sustain the impact of the commercial strategies by creating eye-catching and analytically-effective stories using data. They become specialists who not only possess broad analytical knowledge but have the ability to communicate effectively, enabling the results of their analyses to be understood quickly by the entire organization. On the next level, we have the Analytics Experts, who make descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analyses to increase the efficiency of decision-making on all levels of the business. Analytics Experts are the highest inspirations within the specialist roles within the whole organization.  In order to bring about the adoption of these new behaviors and the change in mindset, it is vital to have active participation from the leaders, which is why an executive-level training was envisaged with the development of two roles: on the one hand, the Team Leader, whose objective is to promote analytical power in their team and challenge current analytical standard with the aim of increasing operational efficiency and generating greater value for the company. And on the other hand, we have the Business Leader, who is responsible for promoting data-based decision-making, focused at all times on improving and transforming the business through analysis and artificial intelligence. In order to train these professionals with their very diverse profiles, Belcorp joined forces with the specialized education firm Udacity to offer a training program which, in addition to a solid theoretical base, includes practical use cases the students have to solve during the course. This training began with an initial pilot scheme involving 8 Data Rockstars who completed a nanodegree and provided some important constructive feedback: To really develop analytical skills, it is important that the examples used on the courses are similar to the students\u2019 everyday experience, and that functions like connection to Google Analytics and Facebook are implemented during the course. This gave us the input to create personalized and potential training courses which were much better at encouraging participation and obtaining specific results.  And today we have over 100 Data Rockstars who have completed nanodegrees.      One of the most important ways in which a data-driven culture was promoted at Belcorp was via gamification where, using a points system, we motivated employees to take part in different events, talks and challenges. With the support of the Talent and Culture team, communities were fostered in Teams and Workplaces to focus on boosting data literacy. The quest for points, prizes and personal growth gave rise to a high level of participation in the events created by the Belcorp Data Academy, from LIVEs dealing with data handling issues and using Tableau, to participation in the Belcorp AI FEST and successful completion of the different courses on offer. We intend to continue making use of this in future events focused on storytelling and data visualization, to continue promoting participation, interaction and data-based decisions. One outstanding event was the Belcorp AI festival, which consisted of 5 days of full-on knowledge, experiences, inspiration and calls to action. Every single employee left the event convinced that their ideas are the starting point for changing the world and this will allow us to carry on challenging ourselves to take the next step hand-in-hand with artificial intelligence and advanced analytics, in order to offer our consumers the very best experience.\n\n\n\nBelcorp AI Festival managed to bring in minds from the leading companies in different industries such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, Udacity, Sprinklr, Mars, Atlan, Abacus AI, Mu Sigma, IBM, Perfect Corp, Inetum and Globant. Their CEOs and leaders shared with us the future of Artificial Intelligence as well as trends from around the world. In addition, they shared their opinions, experiences and best practices, which left all the employees with a great deal of knowledge and inspiration to be better and successfully meet the challenges of today's world. The inclusion of recreational events, challenges and games has helped Belcorp\u2019s internal platform achieve an extremely positive reception, with thousands of daily visits and dashboards created. We now have over 3,000 registered users, taking data-based decisions and exploring new possibilities. We intend to carry on supporting this growth and offering tools and support to our users so that they can continue to explore the world of data. We create new activities, challenges and ways of relating to users in order to continue, every day, to make Belcorp a company with a data-driven focus from top to bottom. \u201cAt first identifying an employee who wanted, and was able, to fulfill the role of Data Rockstar was complex and tedious. Now that they are more aware of the implications and impact of this role, we receive lots of requests from employees interested in being trained up for it, as the distinguished value proposal that was created with the Belcorp Data Academy has opened up access to courses and certificates that are recognized globally and add weight to their career.\u201d  To evaluate the progress of the Data Academy, the Belcorp team uses the Kirkpatrick model designed for analyzing and evaluating the results of educational programs. It takes any training style, whether informal or formal, into consideration in order to determine aptitude based on four levels of criteria. \u201cLevel 1: Reaction\u201d measures how participants react to the training, and here what we are concerned with is the degree of satisfaction with the training they receive. On this level we have the NPS indicator. In \u201cLevel 2: Learning\u201d, we want to know whether they truly absorbed the knowledge.  And here we use the metrics RCI (Reliable Change Index) and SID (Standard Individual Difference), which are calculated after inputting the results of each employee before and after assessment, having completed a course and checked whether they truly understood the training. \u201cLevel 3: Behavior\u201d looks at whether they are utilizing what they learned at work and changes in conduct are taking place. The metric of weekly active and concurrent users on Tableau is used for this purpose. Finally, Level 4 lists the results and determines whether the material had a positive impact on the business/organization.  Using this model at Belcorp, and having these visible metrics during the implementation of the Belcorp Data Academy, has enabled us to quickly identify areas for improvement for any new initiative launched, not only in terms of implementing new courses, but also in events we have launched as part of the gamification process. When we see an initiative that is not having a positive impact on any of the variables, we call the Data Rockstars in to obtain feedback and implement the necessary changes to ensure every action coming out of the Belcorp Data Academy has a direct, positive impact on the Kirkpatrick model markers. IMPACT ON BELCORP To date, Belcorp is extremely proud to have achieved: All of these data prove that Belcorp is moving forward on its path to becoming a Data-Driven Company, promoting the application of learned concepts and fostering data-based decision-making in its employees in their day-to-day work. Cultivating a data culture represents just the start of a project aimed at taking Belcorp to new levels. And what a start! \u201cTableau has grown in leaps and bounds; once everyone began to see its potential we received numerous requests for access, everyone wanted to have eye-catching reports. Everybody wanted to use the tool. In just a minute, you can change so many things on Tableau, and everyone wants access to that agility. We have already started to witness impacts in areas like product line evaluation and monitoring in (almost) real time, enabling our planning team to make quick decisions, segmented by geographical location,\u201d says Lizeth Verano. For Belcorp, this is only the start of the long road it wishes to travel. We know that talent is the fundamental basis for achieving digital transformation changes and we want to give our employees the tools and training necessary for them to become ever-better versions of themselves and be able to deal with today's disruptive world. We believe in the power of ideas and the power of inspiration that lies in each and every one of us. Ultimately, if we have happy employees that will be reflected in happy customers,\u201d says Venkat Gopalan. "

        "company": "FAW Volkswagen",
        "content": "FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Co., ltd. (\"FAW-Volkswagen\")is a joint venture and a large passenger vehicle maker, owning 3 major brands: Volkswagen, Audi, and Jetta. After 30 years' development, FAW-Volkswagen now has production capacity in several major provinces and cities in China, with 6 saloon car factories, a powertrain business unit, and a stamping center. Noticing that accelerated digital transformation has became an inevitable trend in the post-covid times, FAW-Volkswagen accurately seized the emerging opportunity and decided that it should further open up and embrace changes in data utilization and data potential releasing. This is why the company introduced and encouraged use of Tableau to facilitate data-based communication and data-driven decision-making. With Self-Help Data Analysis, Tableau Improves Productivity And Analysis Autonomy Pushed by the wave of digital transformation, traditional industries represented by vehicle manufacturers are facing a landscape that changes quickly. They generate and come into contact with tons of data during operation and management. However, as automobile makers are generally running in the traditional way, their data assets are excluded from business conversion. With this background, digging out useful information from the data and empower added business value has become an important topic as for FAW-Volkswagen to maintain their core competitiveness. FAW-Volkswagen realized that to maximize the value of data resource, automobile makers need the hand of a great business intelligence (BI) assistant. As a result, they introduced Tableau in 2015 and has been extending deployment and promoting adoption since 2018, under the support of DKM ECO, a Tableau distributor. Tableau was favored by FAW-Volkswagen for its ease of use and friendliness to beginners when they were choosing the right BI platform. Since Tableau is easy to use, they could analyze their data conveniently without having to recruit data professionals, and this advances digitalization of the company. DMK served as a housekeeper during the process, providing tailored technical support and services, while making suggestions based on the current state, helping them to build up an internal community and service system. Tableau is used by FAW-Volkswagen in marketing and sales of Audi, Volkswagen, and Jetta cars, to visualize daily work reports. Their people use Tableau to analyze sales data, so that they get and insight of monthly and quarterly sales, to figure out how to increase sales volume, save cost and improve productivity. Previously, 90% of FAW-Volkswagen workers use traditional data analysis methods, which required a lot of repeated operations and provided poor visualization. It was very difficult to improve efficiency. For example, analyzing data collected from training sessions required a whole week's work of 2 people. Using Tableau, each of them were able to save 2-3 days, reducing 50% of working hours. Assisted by Tableau, FAW-Volkswagen's business workers could carry out self-help data analysis, allowing IT to focus on platform deployment and administration, instead of struggling with specific operations. The workers can get an insight of the business by understanding data and the information behind. With the capability to explore data, the company managed to optimize their workflow and free human resource, and now, their productivity and management are on a new level. Help Employees to Develop A Data Analysis Mindset Based on Tableau, to Optimize the Production Process And Focus on Details During Implementation Digital transformation evolves all respects of an enterprise, which means relying on a few data specialists is not enough. They need to help employees to build up a data analysis habitat, to get used to think about data, and to figure out solutions based on data. Tableau does not require data background and provides powerful visualization, which satisfies the company's rigid demand of urgent digital transformation. FAW-Volkswagen recognizes Tableau as an excellent data analysis platform, for it provides prospective modern BI analysis capabilities to facilitate digital transformation. As a result, more and more FAW-Volkswagen employees started using Tableau for data analysis. Tableau inspires data-based thinking, so the employees are now making data-driven decisions everyday. The company managed to optimize workflow of the production units, assign production activities and focus on details, to improve productivity and empower digital transformation. At first, Tableau was only applied at a small scale, in Audi dealerships. As the outcome owned accumulated credit, it was gradually rolled out to most FAW-Volkswagen dealerships. Three years later, FAW-Volkswagen had been working with Tableau to hold in-house training camps, to help employees build up and develop data analysis skill sets. The FAW-Volkswagen Academy also used Tableau to analyze how much the students learned in each empowerment project, to improve course quality. Data source of the Academy were spreadsheets exported by multiple business units from multiple platforms. With Tableau, more than ten thousand pieces of data from 20+ business units were analyzed each day, and the average daily page views (PVs) reached 10000+. More than 2000 employees engaged in deep learning through data analysis camps, and now, there are 400+ frequent users and 30+ BUs use data analysis powered by  Tableau to optimize and improve their workflows. As FAW-Volkswagen's important self-help BI platform, Tableau was utilized and promoted by various BUs; it changed how employees think about data. Tableau Drives Business Decisions, Facilitates Cost Saving and Productivity Improvement, Helping Enterprises to Gain An Competitive Edge Digital evolution is changing the competition landscape of the manufacturing industry, leaving the mainstay of manufacturing, automobile makers, to ever-changing opportunities and challenges.  FAW-Volkswagen believes that data analysis can help with workflow optimization effectively, and it enables the company to discover and solve problems, in addition to conducting business and improving management. As a self-help data analysis platform, Tableau is there with every employee as they grow, helping the organization to get a head start. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, employees were not able to work together at one place, and work from home brought some inconvenience to the business. Tableau helped the company to breakthrough geographical limitations. They brought up an online business system, and got a head start. Using the daily analysis platform, employees could publish monitoring reports they developed to the server, allowing their colleagues to remotely sign in to share and view the production data, so that everyone could get on the same page in time. Beside, Tableau Dashboards drove many important decisions at FAW-Volkswagen, especially during workshop production downtimes and vehicle selling. The Audi Claim Team used to have 8 people work for 8 weeks to analysis the massive data. In 2020, the team turned to Tableau,  analyzed data in regard with dealership and component failure by 13 metrics. Tableau analysis brought forward the company's strategic adjustment, contributed to cost saving of more than 10 million CNY. Besides, the Audi Claim Team also used Tableau to build up an agile analysis system, saving 4 hours for analysis each weak, allowing them to predict custom claims and provide better service for the customers even before claims really happen. Jiang Hongbo from the Training Strategy And Management Department at FAW-Volkswagen said, \"Great organizations must use and understand data, and that's what we do.Tableau encourages business users who don't have a technical background to analyze data by themselves, which is highly efficient and agile, helping business units to reduce cost while improve productivity. Practicing and carrying on Tableau's learning and analysis mindset, they developed a data culture and abundant data masters, preparing human resource for digital transformation.\" As digital transformation becomes an inevitable trend of the future of manufacturing, traditional automobile companies including FAW-Volkswagen are seizing emerging opportunities, and prepared to cope with every opportunity and challenge with unmatched keen insights. Tableau data analysis activated FAW-Volkswagen's data assets and enabled data-driven decisions, which improved the agility of the company's business and operation management.  FAW-Volkswagen believes that Tableau will help more organizations to build up their data culture, lay a solid foundation for digital transformation, and improve industrial competence.

        "title": "Mahindra Finance democratizes data to help every employee perform at their best",
        "company": "Mahindra Finance",
        "content": "Mahindra Finance is one of the largest Non-Banking Financial Companies in India and part of the wider Mahindra Group, a $19.4 billion federation of companies with operations in 100 countries. Together, they share a philosophy of 'Rise For Good' and are focused on transforming rural lives and driving positive change in the communities. Mahindra Finance delivers on this mission by providing customers with a range of financial services. These include automotive loans, personal loans, consumer durables financing, insurance broking, mutual funds, and home loans. In 2017, Mahindra Finance turned to Tableau and began a data journey to drive its business' continued growth while increasing productivity and repayment efficiency. The business has since established a strong data culture that helps every employee achieve better results. In the past, extraction of data from systems and dashboards for senior management were functions centralised under IT. However, with data becoming more important for decision making, the business wanted a solution that would democratize data and make it accessible to everyone. It chose Tableau because of positive testimonials from other large banks and because it came with a number of features suited to its needs. These included integration with Python and the scalability needed to support thousands of users at once. Mahindra Finance established a Tableau Centre of Excellence early on and hired a team of business intelligence (BI) experts, including several Tableau admins and testers. They established a private cloud infrastructure and created a data mart with all of the information they needed for dashboards to get started. As a financial services company, Mahindra Finance follows strict guidelines in relation to data handling and privacy, so it also set up a governance framework to prevent unauthorized data access. The next phase of adoption included training. Mahindra Finance began with training for its BI experts and has subsequently provided training on data-based decision making for a total of 3,000 employees. This includes senior and middle management, branch managers, field executives, and those who work in departments like human resources and marketing. The CRG team worked in collaboration with the Tableau team to achieve sustainable, scalable Tableau Analytics at Mahindra Finance. They helped adopt the right Data Strategy and create Data Marts and functional Dashboards that helped the management in taking data driven decisions and track business growth. According to Mr. Agarwal, Tableau has put a magnifying glass on the business, allowing management to examine all aspects of performance. For example, they can view the business' entire portfolio on a monthly and quarterly basis and drill down to look at descriptive parameters such as location or interest rate. They can also look at predictive parameters such as the probability of default. Tableau helps branch managers and field executives understand performance at a local level. They can track how many new loans are secured each day and how many more they need to reach the national average. They can also see which loans are due or past due for repayment. Equated monthly installments (EMIs) are paid in cash, so once executives identify which loans are due, they can use Tableau to plot those customers on a map and plan their daily route. Non performing assets (NPAs) is another key datapoint tracked by Mahindra Finance, and with Tableau, it can monitor this on a more granular level. \"We have always tracked NPAs, but now we can spot trends and investigate issues at a branch level. If we see that someone is routinely bringing in non performing contracts, for example, we can find out why and support them to bring in better business,\" said Mr. Agarwal. \"This helps us to control NPAs better and manage our profitability.\" Mahindra Finance is building on its data culture with a mission to bring all 16,000 of its employees onto Tableau. It is currently creating dashboards for business functions like HR, marketing, accounting, and legal. These include a new dashboard for marketing which helps them to identify regions for potential growth. Mr. Agarwal shared that the business is also augmenting its data with external data points. By looking at data from the Regional Transport Office, for example, Mahindra Finance could see how many cars have been sold and plan its sales targets accordingly. Predictive analytics is another important focus for the business. It is already using predictive analytics to assess new loans' risk and wants to expand this to new use cases \"I believe data analytics will get a lot more predictive. I don't want to just look at how we performed last quarter. I want to know how much we will grow and how productive we will be in the future,\" Mr. Agarwal concludes. "

        "title": "Gatwick Airport puts data right at the heart of business operations with Tableau",
        "company": "Gatwick Airport",
        "content": "Nestled in the heart of south-east England, Gatwick Airport welcomes millions of international business travellers and holiday makers through its doors every year. As one of the world\u2019s leading airports, it\u2019s constantly looking for new ways to improve the travel experience for its customers - from the food and shopping facilities on-site, to the range of countries and destinations served. Here, Shariq Wagener, Director of Data & Analytics for Gatwick Airport\u2019s implementation partner Zsah, goes back to 2019 and discusses why Gatwick relies on Tableau and how analytics fits into its overall digital transformation strategy, putting data right at the heart of business operations. Since its implementation, Tableau has given employees access to fast, intuitive analytics through a centrally governed platform, helping them make informed, data driven decisions that benefit customers every day. The benefits will play a key role in the recovery from pandemic. Gatwick Airport is an incredibly data rich organisation. It has analysts spread across a wide range of departments, from commercial and marketing to new business development, all of whom deal with a huge amount of data every day. However, following an assessment in 2019 we realised there were a lot of problems with siloed systems and non-standardised ways of working that created major inconsistencies across the enterprise. People were asking the same questions internally but getting very different answers, primarily because the data they were using didn\u2019t reside in a clean, well governed environment that was suited to self-service analytics. Having a platform that works in harmony with the DataOps lifecycle is extremely valuable. DataOps consists of three stages - exploit, scale and support. Prior to Tableau, Gatwick\u2019s business analysts didn\u2019t have the ability to exploit datasets themselves, so had to rely on the IT team to do it for them. With Tableau, not only can these analysts now exploit the datasets available in the platform, they can also create and interrogate their own, helping identify new commercial opportunities. For example, the commercial department conducts passenger surveys at the airport, collecting a range of information from passengers, such as how far they travelled to get here, where they\u2019re flying to, and whether Gatwick was their first choice. Analysing this data helps the team better understand the market and spot areas where things like Gatwick\u2019s airport transfer service can be expanded, opening up new revenue streams in the process. Before Tableau was rolled out in 2019, the team would waste valuable hours trying to correlate different datasets in spreadsheets and manually transpose the results onto heat maps for use in new business proposals. Now, everything is done instantly in Tableau. Data is linked together at the backend and automatically pulled from the relevant sources into a comprehensive heatmap that can be filtered by geography or customised however needed. They can even drill down into individual counties, making analysis of factors like passenger journey times and catchment areas really easy to perform. As a result, data trends and insights that might previously have been missed or overlooked are quickly identified, meaning they can be factored into decision making or used as proof points in new proposals. Decision makers at every level, from senior executives to airport operatives, now have direct access to the information they need to make fast, informed decisions whenever required. This means the company\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t being bombarded with repeated data questions and requests anymore. As a result, they are free to focus on more strategic analytics projects instead, such as forecasting and scheduling, airport optimisation and new pricing strategies. Bringing this kind of capability in-house is also saving Gatwick money. Now the organisation can discover and act on data insights itself, whereas before it had to buy them from specialist analytics vendors. It\u2019s no longer having to make an ongoing investment to ask questions of its own data and find the insights it needs. Culture comprises three key elements: technology, people and processes. The first things digital transformation addressed were the technology and processes. Now, by creating an enablement plan throughout the entire organisation, it\u2019s bringing employees together as well. As a result, everyone is more engaged with data. They\u2019re using it to speak with each other, learn from each other and help each other as well. If that isn\u2019t a strong data culture, I don\u2019t know what is. An intuitive platform like Tableau, that\u2019s easy to implement and engage with, plays a critical role in driving successful digital transformation. Implementing it has enabled Gatwick to bring all of its operational data into one central location, helping employees conduct their own analytics and identify key insights much faster than was previously possible."

Sequis Life markets individual and group life and health insurance through agency channels and, together with the other Sequis businesses, it has 80 sales offices in 28 cities in Indonesia. The company also supports customers through seven customer service centres in Jakarta, Medan, Bandung, Surabaya, Denpasar, and Semarang. Sequis Life is in the midst of a digital transformation with the goal to become the country\u2019s leading life and health insurance company. Data and analytics play a key role in this transformation, and Sequis Life is using Tableau to combine and extract insights from its structured and unstructured data. The company is also building a data culture which will help employees to sharpen their data literacy skills and make sense of their own data. \u201cData and analytics are now at the core of our business and helping us understand our customers\u2019 needs and how we can serve them better,\u201d said Budiman Rusly Djohari, Chief Data & Analytics Officer at Sequis Life. Prior to adopting Tableau, Sequis Life\u2019s data was siloed in different systems and had to be manually extracted and consolidated to create reports and dashboards. This process often took days or even weeks and was prone to human error, which made it difficult to trust the data. \u201cWe have so much data in our systems, but we had to make a significant change in the way we access and explore that data to optimize the value from it. We chose to implement Tableau because many of us had used it previously and experienced the benefits already. Tableau is also very easy to work with, and when we showed it to the business, they were impressed with its visualization capabilities,\u201d said Budiman. To ease the adoption of Tableau, the Data and Analytics team worked with each department to create a simple dashboard based on a specific problem. They then showed them how to use that dashboard to explore and understand their data. In the 12 months since this initial rollout, the number of Tableau users within the business has nearly tripled. The Data and Analytics team has also established governance processes to enable self-serve analytics without compromising security. In addition, reports and dashboards, which previously took days or weeks to create, can now be completed or refreshed in just minutes. \u201cWhen a business user needs the latest data, they can just go to Tableau and click to refresh their dashboards. They are also empowered to design their own dashboards so that they can solve problems on their own,\u201d said Budiman. Budiman added that there is also greater trust in the data now with the removal of manual processes reducing human error. Sequis Life uses Tableau to track and analyze a number of business activities, including agency sales performance, customer segmentation, claims processing, and key aspects of the customer journey. The data helps the business to understand performance challenges and identify opportunities to optimize resources and improve the customer experience. During the pandemic, Sequis Life used Tableau to capture and respond to customer needs quickly. It designed a claims dashboard which provided a complete view of key parameters needed to speed up claim processing while also detecting any anomalies. There was also a dashboard to track the sales activity of agencies and ensure that they were on track to reach their targets. Budiman and his team are now continuing to build and champion a data culture. Training sessions are run once a quarter for those new to Tableau and data analytics. There\u2019s also an advanced training course available to those who want to learn more. Those who participate in the advanced training are tasked to solve a data challenge that will positively impact their department. They then go on to become a data champion themselves. \u201cWhat we are doing is building data literacy and bringing business users closer to their own data. They can then combine that data with their expertise to solve strategic problems,\u201d said Budiman. \u201cIt is revolutionizing the way we work and will help bring competitive advantage in the current fast-moving market.\u201d"

        "content": "\u2018Data beats opinion\u2019. That\u2019s the tagline for Swisscom\u2019s strategy to change the way people use data to solve problems. Switzerland\u2019s leading telecommunications provider aims to connect different silos \u2013 unifying data on everything from network antenna performance and TV broadcast quality, to marketing campaign effectiveness. Here, Swisscom\u2019s team responsible for the analytics platforms that underpin the data-driven strategy share how Tableau is helping 3,000 employees to trust data as a strategic asset and use it for timely decision-making. The results have led to improved customer experience and business growth. They also highlight how Tableau Blueprint is playing a vital role in creating a flourishing, fast-growing data community. Pradeep Fernando, VP Product Management, Data, Analytics & AI, Swisscom emphasizes, \u201cTableau plays a key role in driving Swisscom\u2019s data-driven company transformation, already helping add more than 1,000 monthly active users within a span of 1.5 years.\u201d Swisscom is shaping Switzerland\u2019s digital future. The company is one of the most popular and trusted brands in Switzerland, providing mobile and fixed network telecommunications, Internet, digital TV, and IT solutions to millions of business and residential customers. Many people at Swisscom are advocates for Tableau: evangelists for using interactive, visual analysis to quickly reach the root cause of a problem and find answers. This includes Eric Bugnon, the original inspirer for introducing Tableau into Swisscom. \u201cIt\u2019s the speed to insight that impresses everyone,\u201d says Eric, Product Owner, Tools for Analytics at Swisscom. \u201cBefore Tableau, it could take weeks to extract data from a database, prepare the data, and create a report. Now it\u2019s dramatically faster. Owing to this decision-making agility, Swisscom is more responsive and is able to innovate new telco and IT solutions faster.\u201d One particular line of business showing tangible transformation is the business-to-business (B2B) channel. In the past, customer sales orders were mainly transacted via a live call center agent owing to the complexity of the product portfolio. Tableau is now used to track each customer engagement and understand how customers navigate the sales process. By tuning the digital sales order process, Swisscom has increased the volume of self-service order transactions by 15%. This improved customer experience is cascading throughout Swisscom. An important B2B customer, for example, recently needed to increase the number of concurrent users of Swisscom\u2019s Enterprise SIP communications solution during the Covid-19 pandemic. With many employees working from home, they urgently needed to correlate the number of concurrent calls with virus cases and other news events to ensure communications supply met with demand. Eric continues, \u201cWe presented the daily actualized data to the customer in an interactive Tableau dashboard. The customer was amazed at how quickly we delivered the report, its simplicity, and drill-down insights. The outcome being that the customer bought additional SIP licenses, enabling staff to work from home with confidence, and we extended the trust shared between both organizations.\u201d In Swisscom\u2019s IT, Innovation, Network and Infrastructure division, Tableau is helping to shape the next generation of digital telco solutions and ensure the current technologies operate at peak efficiency. Eric explains, \u201cTableau helps us see and understand everything, from the location and performance of network antennas, to where maintenance is needed and where issues are most likely to occur. Swisscom\u2019s network infrastructure is consistently ranked the best in the country \u2013 and Tableau has an important part to play in that success.\u201d At Swisscom TV, employees use Tableau to support live operational service performance, in pursuit of flawless broadcast quality. It is used for service operation management processes, such as incident and problem management. And marketing teams use Tableau to create on-demand and standardized reporting that transforms broadcast marketing analytics, whether TV use insights, churn and sales orders, mobile payment insights, and promotions. Tableau Server is also integrated into the Swisscom B2B extranet portal, as an embedded analytics service branded \u2018Business Analytics\u2019. Customers are able to view dynamic dashboards of service performance via the portal, and the versatile dashboards can also be published as part of an individual customer project. \u201cThe flexibility of Tableau allows us to react quickly and generate insights that can support a migration. \u2018Business Analytics\u2019 also establishes a common ground for transparent service assurance between Swisscom and its customers,\u201d says Eric. The Tableau Blueprint methodology is helping to broaden and deepen this data-driven culture. The Tableau community they have built, for example, is helping to drive adoption and continuous learning. Its landing page features assets to help guide people who are new to Tableau, such as step-by-step tutorial videos. Advanced employees are active participants in the community as well, answering other employees Tableau queries, offering tips, and showcasing their own Tableau success stories internally. \u201cThere\u2019s a real urge to analyze data,\u201d says Eric. \u201cWe regularly have people coming to us saying, \u2018I want to learn about Tableau\u2019. We point them to the community portal \u2013 and their data-driven thinking and journey start there. In fact, our community is among the largest data organizations in Switzerland. Everyone wants data for their decisions.\u201d New talent is drawn to this modern, analytics-focused business. Jaime Ramirez, a BI Architect comments, \u201cPeople enjoy using Tableau. It is perceived as modern, disruptive, and easy to use. When we needed support to improve the community functionality, for example, we quickly found two graduates eager to work with Tableau. After all, uncovering unexpected insights in this intuitive, visual environment is empowering.\u201d Swisscom\u2019s technical architecture deserves a success story in its own right. The company recently migrated multiple Tableau instances to a single, enterprise-wide instance, residing within Swisscom\u2019s own cloud infrastructure. \u201cThis migration maintains Swisscom\u2019s rhythm of innovation,\u201d says Eric. \u201cSecurity and data privacy are vitally important Swisscom. The new architecture is not only transparent to the 3,000 end users, but gives us significant improvement in availability, performance, and, most importantly, security.\u201d"

        "company": "Department of Disease Control Thailand",
        "content": "The Department of Disease Control (DDC) is an important government department under the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand responsible for the public health of the Thai people through disease prevention and control. To achieve this mission, they have tapped on data as a strategic asset. Using Tableau, the DDC was able to efficiently work with large sets of data to understand the healthcare situation amongst the Thai population to guide policy working. Complicated data sets were also broken down according to common disease types such as dengue, malaria and food poisonings and regularly published on its website to inform and educate the public. Traditionally, data analysis had been a very manual process. When dealing with data from multiple sources and in various formats, the DDC often had to rely on a small group of skilled programmers to clean and prep the data for analysis. This process took a lot of time. To improve its operational efficiency, the DDC wanted to democratize analytics to more of its employees who are medical professionals so that they can benefit from the data insights directly. This was made possible by using Tableau - even with just basic computer skills, DDC employees were able to create their own visualizations within one to two days, hugely reducing the reliance on IT teams. This marked improvement from the past, when employees can take more than ten days to gain enough confidence with business intelligence tools. Extracting data from complex data sets also became much faster; instead of an overnight process, this can now be done in just two to three hours. \u201cThe learning curve with Tableau is very short compared to traditional business intelligence tools, and it makes it easier for our business users to interact with and make sense of their data,\u201d said Yongjua Laosiritaworn MD, MPH, PhD who is the Information Centre Director at DDC.\u201c One of Tableau\u2019s greatest strengths is the way it allows us to quickly and easily connect with our data. As an analytics tool, it also helps people to understand their data better and make decisions.\u201d Democratizing analytics capabilities across the organization afforded the DDC a critical advantage in managing the Covid-19 crisis. When employees in the field responsible for disease control are equipped with the skills needed to work with data insights, they can plan in advance knowing where, which group and when there might be an outbreak. For instance, following a recent outbreak, DDC was able to identify a specific region of concern and create a control zone to minimize the spread. During the pandemic, the DDC relied heavily on Tableau to inform its response. They have had to maintain oversight on the situation over the whole of Thailand and leveraged Tableau to consolidate information from various regions in the country. By developing real-time visualizations to understand the impact of Covid-19 in different regions, they could remain agile to make real-time public health decisions. Data has also been a critical asset to support the efficient allocation of resources. The DDC collates data from 500-600 hospitals in their data warehouse - ranging from the number of available hospital beds, availability of medicine and vaccinations and number of patients serving quarantine. Combining all this information in a central place like Tableau empowered the DDC to better manage their resources in line with the most immediate priorities. It has also been crucial for the DDC to maintain public trust and confidence. They rely on data as a single, objective source of truth and frequently publish visualizations on their website to keep people informed of the ongoing situation. As the situation continues to evolve, the DDC is able to maintain this an effective channel of communication with the public. The pandemic has cast a spotlight on the need for the DDC to rely on data-driven decision-making. Still, they must be intentional about maintaining a data-first approach even beyond Covid-19. \"One of the Department of Disease Control's major missions is to protect Thai people from sickness. Accurate and easy to understand data in the form of Tableau visualizations will help the department to achieve this mission,\" said Dr Laosiritaworn. At the same time, the healthcare industry as a whole has become more mature in their understanding and advocacy of data-driven decisions. They have a responsibility to make accurate and timely decisions that have profound implications on their broader community. They must continue to invest in strengthening their data competencies - both with regard to data tools and upskilling - to deliver quality care experiences. For one, the DDC plans to mature its use of analytics with machine learning and AI. This will allow them to better leverage data analytics as a tool to not only streamline their operations but also turn to more granular data insights to support efforts to diagnose, develop treatment plans and predict future diseases.

        "title": "The New Zealand Electricity Authority makes data analytics more accessible",
        "company": "Electricity Authority",
        "content": "The New Zealand Electricity Authority is responsible for the efficient operation of the country\u2019s electricity market. This involves designing and administering market rules that promote competition and ensure a reliable supply of electricity to consumers. To ensure the effectiveness of these rules, the regulator has a dedicated market analytics team that monitors compliance with existing regulations and models the impact of future ones. In the past, most of this analysis was carried out using programming tools or complicated spreadsheet formulas. However, as the regulator came to rely more on data, it needed a different approach. \u201cWe have people doing very advanced analysis on their own, but if they\u2019re not here, no one else can work with that data. We wanted a more consistent approach and to make the analysis more accessible,\u201d said Todd Gillies, Senior Business Intelligence Analyst at the Electricity Authority. Introducing Tableau has helped to solve this challenge. It has given the market analytics team powerful visualization capabilities while also meeting the data needs of finance and other areas of the organization.                             For the market analytics team, one of the most significant advantages of using Tableau has been the ability to analyze large datasets and drill down into the details more easily. \u201cSome of our datasets go back to the 1990s, and while it is easy enough for our team to write an SQL query and put the results up on a dashboard, you also want to be able to access all of that data in the background,\u201d said Gillies. \u201cThe performance of Tableau makes it easier to do that deeper analysis.\u201d The team also relies on Tableau to monitor what\u2019s happening in the current market. One recent example is a visualization created for COVID-19. The regulator was concerned about the financial impacts of the pandemic on both consumers and suppliers and wanted to be ready in case it had to intervene with a new policy. \u201cWe were able to bring a number of data points into Tableau so we could closely monitor the situation and step in at any time we started to see excess disconnections or any financial impacts on suppliers,\u201d said Gillies. \u201cAt the end of the day, there was no major policy change required, but that\u2019s a good outcome. We aim for minimal intervention, and we can better achieve that by making decisions based on data.\u201d                             While the market analytics team\u2019s primary focus is policy, it has become the go-to team for others wanting analytics and advanced reporting. \u201cOther teams like finance have seen what we\u2019re doing with Tableau and come to us with their use cases. As a small organization, we\u2019ve been happy to help, and it has been a good opportunity to connect with different teams and collaborate on data,\u201d said Gillies. There are now 75 people using Tableau across the Electricity Authority, and they have created a total of 145 visualizations. These visualizations include dashboards used to inform policy as well as those used for finance and board reporting. To embed this data culture, Gillies has run internal training alongside Montage, the partner who helped deploy Tableau for the regulator. Gillies himself is also involved in the user groups organized by Montage and brings best practices back to the organization. And while he and his team are still the go-to for producing visualizations, he said Tableau was intuitive for others to use. \u201cI think most people find it easy to navigate their way through, and we try to help by producing visualizations in a consistent way,\u201d said Gillies. The next step in the regulator\u2019s data journey is to move its instance of Tableau Cloud from the data centre in the US to the data centre in Australia. While not required for compliance, Gillies said it made sense for all of its data warehouses to be located in one place and closer to home. In talking about the future of analytics more broadly, Gillies said he hopes to see data become more central to decision making within the electricity industry. The Electricity Authority\u2019s EMI website supports this by making analytics tools available to the whole of the industry. This includes dashboards which are prototyped in Tableau, shaving weeks off development time. \u201cA lot of times decisions will be made without data, and I think one of the challenges is visibility. So by bringing everything together in one central place, we can help people think through potential decisions and what the impacts will be,\u201d said Gillies. "

        "company": "Quandoo",
        "content": "Quandoo is the world's fastest-growing online platform for restaurant reservations, employing more than 500 people. Quandoo was founded in 2012 in Berlin, and today has a community of more than 240 million guests and 18,000 partner restaurants in 12 countries. Since 2015, Quandoo has been a subsidiary of the Japanese Recruit Group. Online reservations is a fast-growing and hugely competitive market. Here, Florian Bachmann, Head of BI at Quandoo, reports how the company is developing into a data-driven organization with Tableau to stay one step ahead. Tableau is enabling Quandoo\u2019s employees to explore their data and find previously hidden insights, freeing up the BI department to deliver strategic projects for the business. \u201cAs a multinational online service company, Quandoo relies on up-to-date data,\u201d explains Florian Bachmann, Head of BI at Quandoo. \u201cWe realized around five years ago that our BI solution, built on open source software, was not going to support us in the future.\u201d The central BI team was inundated with everyday business questions, and bottlenecks were wasting employees\u2019 valuable time and effort that could be better spent elsewhere. Tableau changed everything. \u201cSimply put, it is the best solution for us,\u201d according to Florian. \u201cTableau allows us the flexibility we need when it comes to visual analytics, and connects easily to our various data sources. Tableau incorporates sophisticated access and security management, meaning we can maintain certain controls while allowing employees to explore themselves.\u201d The BI department offers centralized support. By developing employee training sessions, conducting weekly Q&A sessions, and supporting power users in various departments around the business, adoption has accelerated. \u201cTableau has expanded to virtually all areas of the business,\u201d explains Florian. \u201cFor the BI team today, a project is only concluded when it can be interrogated and analysed in Tableau.\u201d With Tableau a mainstay across Quandoo, the company has achieved real transformation globally. \u201cOur employees can answer the vast majority of their business questions themselves with the help of Tableau. It saves employees a lot of time and effort, and frees capacity in the central departments for strategic projects. Thanks to Tableau, Quandoo has turned into a really data-driven enterprise.\u201d Tableau helps improve Quandoo-owned apps and online platforms. \u201cOur contact with restaurants and guests nearly exclusively takes place via our apps, both iOS and Android, as well as online ads and web portals,\u201d explains Florian. \u201cSmall changes to our apps, for example regarding text or image size and color, or with menus and navigation structure, can result in considerable differences in response and conversion rates of our activities. We\u2019re now using Tableau to analyze the results of countless A/B tests, helping us to identify and deploy the most effective solutions to keep our customers happy. In addition, evaluating our online advertising spend enables us to improve our return on investment, diverting money to the most effective campaigns. \u201cWith Tableau in virtually every area of the company, our employees are autonomous and can find new insights to improve our business.\u201d Identifying and attracting eligible restaurant partners is central to Quandoo\u2019s success. While the Quandoo sales teams are available in many countries and cities, physical customer meetings are costly. Quandoo uses Tableau\u2019s advanced mapping capabilities to quickly identify the most promising candidates, determining which cities and restaurants to target. Tableau allows more in depth, interactive analysis, incorporating seating capacity, geographical location, menu, and customer reviews. \u201cWith our geographic analysis in Tableau, we make our sales teams more successful,\u201d explains Florian. \u201cTableau increases the probability our sales team closes a deal, and increases the commitment of new restaurant partners when it comes to volume of orders. This improves our position for the future massively. We have developed into the world\u2019s fastest-growing restaurant reservation platform by becoming truly data-driven.\u201d Quandoo is planning further expansion of Tableau across the business to keep data-driven innovation top of mind. Embedding Tableau within Quandoo\u2019s own platform is the next step, allowing restaurants to see and understand their data regarding orders, guests and more. Florian explains \u201cOverall, by using Tableau we consider ourselves really well-positioned to tackle current and future challenges in a highly competitive online reservation market. We expect to successfully grow and expand our position as a global leader further.\u201d"

        "content": "The annual economic loss from unpaid invoices across the business world can run into billions of Euros, often putting severe financial pressure on companies who can\u2019t recover what they\u2019re owed. Paigo is one of Germany\u2019s leading debt collection businesses, combining personal contact with agile and intelligent digital solutions to help companies avoid bad debt losses. Here, Alexander Pogoster, VP Analytics, Business Intelligence & Risk, discusses how Paigo is using Tableau to significantly expand the data analytics services it offers to clients, helping minimise exposure to bad debts, while simultaneously supporting them on their own digital transformation journeys. We first started using data analytics more than 20 years ago, in order to predict future returns more accurately and to steer and improve internal workflows. Fast forward to the present day and it plays an intrinsic role in all aspects of our operations. We have over 30 full-time data and business analysts collecting and working with data every day, to streamline our own business processes and provide important insights to clients that they can use to improve their own products. Until recently, most of our advanced data analytics activity was available internally only. However, there was a strong desire amongst the senior leadership team to make data and reporting services available to our customers as well, via a new analytics self-service solution. Not only would this help clients identify key insights much faster, but it would also put data-driven decision making at the heart of their operations by helping them to ask and answer their own questions. In mid of 2019, we started building a potential solution for our customers on MicroStrategy - our primary analytics platform at the time - but quickly realised it wouldn\u2019t respond to our needs for fast delivery, professional visuals and deep, intuitive self-service analytics. Knowing the benefits of Tableau, we demonstrated its capabilities to the senior leadership team. In just a couple of days we developed a series of Tableau dashboards based on our requirements that would have taken two to three weeks to produce in MicroStrategy. The decision was quickly made to go with Tableau and within three months we\u2019d built a complete professional solution and given access to the first wave of customers. Feedback has been extremely positive. Most clients were used to static Excel reports, but suddenly they had the flexibility to analyse data on their own, whenever they wanted. All the dashboards were automated on our end too, meaning clients could self-serve their analytics needs in confidence that the data was always up-to-date, secure and accurate. As a result, demand has soared and we\u2019ve scaled up access significantly. Initially, we delivered everything using HTML with embedded analytics. However, we soon switched to Curator from Interworks, a portal solution which made it easier to create customised user experiences that were both professional looking and highly interactive. Based on the positive results from our first externally-facing self-service analytics solutions, we started to work on a new offering for companies in the mobility sector, where ticket evasion is a key concern. We created a product that helps our customers use data to identify specific locations and times where ticket evasion is most likely to be occurring on their services. This product uses historical data on successful convictions for fare evasion and creates a heatmap in Tableau that highlights where and when the majority of these offences took place. Companies can then use the information to ensure ticket inspectors are present on the most \u2018high risk\u2019 services, helping minimise lost revenues. Our original adoption of Tableau was driven by the desire to extend our external analytics services and offerings. However, after seeing the positive impact it was having on clients, we quickly realised how beneficial it would be internally. We began migrating at the end of 2019 and now all of our own analytics systems are based in Tableau as well. Simply put, Tableau is a much more engaging platform to use. Dashboards can be developed faster and customised more easily, meaning time to insight is significantly shorter. In the past we\u2019d have 10 separate views in a dashboard with diverse parameters, making analysis tricky and time-consuming. Now the same data is viewed and analysed in a single platform, which can be quickly filtered based on individual questions and needs. Colleagues regularly tell me that Tableau is genuinely fun to use too, which encourages them to go in and just experiment with data. This has led to a much stronger internal data culture developing, where data is more transparent and people aren\u2019t afraid to conduct their own analytics every day."

        "company": "Emami Limited",
        "content": "Established in 1974, Emami is a leading personal care and healthcare business in India whose vision is to naturally make people healthy and beautiful. The business has a portfolio of more than 300 products which it sells into 60 countries under brands such as Navratna, BoroPlus, and Zandu. Tableau helps Emami measure brands' health and performance and has played a central role in maturing the business' use of analytics. According to Sudipta Mukherjee, Deputy General Manager of SAP BI and Analytics Projects at Emami, the business started its data journey in 2012. However, for many years, reports were compiled using spreadsheets and took too long to prepare. Emami wanted to speed up reporting by providing each department with dashboards that could be refreshed automatically by pulling information straight from its data warehouse. It also wanted to make use of predictive analytics rather than always looking at the past. This is when CRG Solutions, a leading Tableau partner in India, stepped in to convert Emami\u2019s vision into reality. With CRG\u2019s help, the business chose to roll out Tableau because of its broad visualization capabilities. In evaluating Tableau alongside other analytics tools, Emami also found that it was the easiest to use. \"Tableau stood out for the simplicity with which users can interact with the user interface and get their questions answered,\" said Mukherjee. Establishing Tableau as its analytics platform has allowed Emami to move towards a self-service model for analytics. Departments no longer need to wait ten days for month-end reports. Instead, they can simply click to refresh dashboards on the second day of each month. They also better appreciate the value of using data in their day-to-day decision making. CRG supported Emami in advancing its use of analytics and building its data culture. \"When we started with Tableau, there was some hesitancy about using a new platform, but CRG helped us engage people through workshops, which led to a steady stream of requests for dashboards and visualizations,\" Mukherjee. Emami now has 150 employees using Tableau to visualize a wide range of performance metrics. These include product sales by region and by channel. Emami also has a brand heatmap that it can drill down into to understand which brands generate the most growth. These insights help the business make better decisions about where and how it sells products. For example, knowing which products are performing well in each region Emami can make data-driven recommendations to retailers on what they should purchase to sell in their stores. Emami can also pinpoint any loss of sales across regions by visualizing brand, product, and SKU data and using a decision tree for root cause analysis. Other visualizations help Emami track financial and operational metrics. For example, the business can see all purchase orders at a glance and drill down to investigate those which have been open too long. It can also monitor productivity and operational hygiene. Mukherjee said that the visualizations in Tableau had been particularly useful in analyzing business changes during COVID-19 and been used by some teams to conduct virtual business review meetings. He shared that Emami is now focused on making more use of predictive analytics. Advanced analytics use cases include providing sales reps with cross sell and up-sell recommendations and optimizing sales routes to improve Market Representative productivity and Market Representative sales success rates. \"We have gradually moved up the value chain from ad hoc descriptive analytics to self-service visualizations and are now moving towards predictive analytics which will help us optimize our business activities,\" said Mukherjee.

        "content": "Hankook Tire & Technology (Hankook Tire), No. 1 company in the domestic tire market, manufactures tires for various types of vehicles, e.g. passenger cars, electric vehicles and SUVs. In addition, its top-tier technological competitiveness is recognized around the world so much that Hankook Tire was ranked No. 1 in a tire test conducted by a famous European automotive magazine in 2020. As it succeeded in developing a road risk detection solution and a model for predicting the physical properties of tire compounds based on the AI and deep learning technology in line with the transition to the age of the 4th Industrial Revolution, it is leading the digital transformation of the tire industry. It is producing tires in its 8 production bases in Asia, the US and Europe, and selling them in more than 180 countries around the world, and its sales amounted to about 6.8 trillion KRW in 2019. It employs over 20,000 people around the globe. Hankook Tire is using Tableau for digital transformation, creation of the data culture, data-based decision-making, self-service analysis and visualization by employees in business departments and the smart factory project. It is using Tableau to improving business efficiency while finding and sharing meaningful insight from vast amounts of data at the fastest speed and leading the growth of business in the face of changes in the external environment. In particular, it is building the integrated data governance system, which connects the data of 8 production plants around the world and developing the big data analysis program necessary for advancing the smart factory with Tableau. Reduced the reporting time by about 75% by creating an enterprise-wide data culture Currently, Hankook Tire is using Tableau to analyze and visualize the business data necessary for management, finance, selling, products, manufacturing, production management and researches. And its employees use the dashboard shared across the whole organization to discuss and make decisions in real time. It is improving such jobs as reporting, collaboration between departments and performance measurement by connecting Tableau to the enterprise-wide data warehouse (DW), building 8~9TB (terabytes) datasets necessary for analysis and standardizing data. Also, it is processing up to 300,000 lines of data fast. In the past, if frontline employees sent ideas about data analysis and report development to the IT, the IT Department built an appropriate dataset, developed the report, made modifications and improvements through collaboration with frontline employees. It used to take a lot of time before actual use. In addition, as data was not standardized, it was difficult to build an analysis and reporting system that can be applied consistently to different jobs. Meanwhile, at Hankook Tire, frontline employees\u2019 demand for using the data of the system essential to its global business to develop reports and derive insight that can lead to improvement of business performance is increasing. As a result, the management wanted to create a data culture based on an enterprise-wide analysis system, and actively encourage frontline employees to improve their data use proficiency. Hankook Tire introduced Tableau because the drag & drop-based intuitive visualization enables the employees of all business departments to quickly develop sophisticated reports early using only IT technology and education support. It also regarded the fact that IT employees can instantly respond to the requirements of frontline employees as a big advantage. After adoption of Tableau, Hankook Tire implemented the 'self-service analysis\u2019 environment in which the employees of all departments can analyze standardized data. It standardized various kinds of data, and established consistent standards for efficient data-based collaboration between different organizations in the company. The employees of different departments use Tableau to universally utilize data for their work based on common understanding of data. The employees of frontline departments are freely exploring the data that can be utilized for report development and concretizing requirements with easy-to-use Tableau. As a result, the IT Department is taking charge of only report development and data management with a high level of difficulty, and concentrating on strategic business impacting the entire company in terms of business digitalization. Thanks to the easy data processing function of the GUI environment of Tableau, Hankook Tire reduced the time it takes to develop 1 report by 75% from about one month to one week. Frontline employees can visualize vast amounts of data at the speed of light using the dashboard shared in the Tableau portal, and the Tableau dashboard embedded in the 7 business systems of the company. Lee Jae-sang, G.IT Planning Team, Digital Strategy Department, Hankook Tire, said, \u201cAs Tableau is popularly used in various industries, including manufacturing, and in universities, it is very easy to use. In particular, as it is possible to develop dashboards, seldom used in Korea industry, e.g., Work Cloud and Heat Map, it helps improve business processes based on analysis and insight.\u201d Currently, the management of Hankook Tire must make critical decisions in real time in response to changes in the global business environment. Connected environment based on Tableau enables the management to talk with frontline employees and make decisions based on key business performance indexes anywhere and anytime. Jae-sang said, \u201cTableau is recognized as a pioneer in modern BI area, and has outstanding references in Korea. Through partnership with Tableau, Hankook Tire is reinforcing data-based business support throughout the organization. We will continue to lead digital transformation in the manufacturing industry through collaboration and decision-making based on standardized data.\u201d Led digital transformation through the smart factory project Currently, the manufacturing industry is improving operating efficiently, productivity and product quality and reinforcing safety by digitalizing the value chain and business environment and combining advanced technologies, e.g. 5G, AI, IoT and robots. Hankook Tire is conducting a project to improve the smart factory technology based on the data it has accumulated over the years through its operation of the tire manufacturing business, e,g. supply and demand of materials, design, R&D, production and distribution. Hankook Tire R&D Center and production headquarters, in charge of the project, are using Tableau to quickly visualize vast amounts of data that are generated in seconds by the various factory facilities of Hankook Tire. They are aiming to use the Tableau dashboard to set apart the data necessary for smart factory applications, e.g. equipment maintenance, management and development, analyze the data through charts and logic, and create a data-based decision-making culture. In particular, Hankook Tire R&D Center provided help with combining the AI technology with the model for predicting the physical properties of tire compounds by using Tableau to visualize the result of tire compound analysis in the Amazon environment. Hankook Tire went a step further, and it is planning to create a system environment for quickly collecting and providing the data of global offices and factories and reinforce data interworking so that the headquarters\u2019 innovation initiative and data standardization system can be expanded to its offices around the world. Lee Gwang-won, G.IT Planning Team, Digital Strategy Department, Hankook Tire, said with emphasis, \u201cCurrently, the IoT and AI based smart factory is a hot topic in the manufacturing industry. As data analysis using Tableau makes it possible to find the insight necessary for improving the reliability and efficiency of manufacturing processes by integrating various kinds of data generated by smart factories, it is key to gaining top-tier competitiveness in the digital age.\u201d Provided support so that business departments can respond quickly to changes in external conditions Before Tableau was introduced, at Hankook Tire, the data used for business decision-making and performance evaluation was not transparent due to the data silos of the system. In fact, as data was often deformed due to the supervision of frontline managers in the process of data retrieval, sorting and reporting, management diagnosis found that the demand for standardization of data and systematization of analysis has been rapidly increasing. Unreliable data was an obstacle to agile decision-making and responding to changes. Hankook Tire is sharing business data in the report sharing portal of Tableau in real time so that business can be conducted based on more accurate data and analysis results in response to the quickly-changing business environment. In this portal, frontline employees use the Tableau maps or graphs to check Hankook Tire products and demand data of each region of the world. In the past, as it used to take 8 hours to update the global inventory and sales data of Hankook Tire, it had difficulties responding to a crisis, but after adoption of Tableau, it is now possible to provide the data to employees in charge of marketing, logistics and sales in 30 minutes. \u201cTo stably operate business in the rapidly-changing world, we must reduce and optimize costs,\u201d said Lee Jae-sang, G.IT Planning Team, Digital Strategy Department, Hankook Tire. \u201cWe could use Tableau to enable frontline employees to share the sales and inventory data of our business operations around the world in real time, and expand the scope of available inventories from the sales perspective, and improve the resiliency of business.\u201d The management and financial management division introduced the Tableau dashboard and significantly reduced the reporting time, and they are planning to become the first to convert all Excel reports to Tableau. In particular, the financial management division where Tableau takes up a large part of its work is developing its own reports without the resources of external IT experts based on the large datasets built with Tableau.. Also, the cost management division is using the mail subscription function to share the intuitive dashboard, which shows budget usage by department and team. Jae-sang said, \u201cTableau makes it possible to share data and reports in real time, and easily find business opportunities amid rapid changes using the function for developing reports with agility. Hankook Tire, making diverse efforts to lead the age of 'digital transformation,\u2019 is expected to use the self-service BI analysis of Tableau to maintain its leadership position as a premium brand in the global market.\u201d Hankook Tire\u2019s partner DFOCUS, made many contributions during the introduction process for Tableau. DFOCUS had broad experience in BI implementation and helped channel the various demands within Hankook Tire, to tangible services through Tableau. In the early stage DFOCUS mainly helped develop Tableau dashboards and train staff yet expanded support to include aiding data development and consulting visual designs to increase satisfaction levels in project participants and with the final outcomes. Furthermore, DFOCUS provided a wealth of knowledge to Hankook Tire during the Tableau implementation process, such as references and methodologies encompassing BI and information sectors, helping Hankook Tire find the best solutions to cater to their needs."

        "title": "Avoid repetitive work and develop data thinking: Tableau helps COFCO Coca-Cola unlock data potential",
        "company": "COFCO Coca Cola",
        "content": "COFCO Coca-Cola Beverage Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as COFCO Coca-Cola), a dedicated beverage company of COFCO Group, is the only Coca-Cola bottling group controlled by Chinese investors in China. The company is a joint venture established by two Fortune 500 companies, COFCO and Coca-Cola. It is among the top five global bottling partners of Coca-Cola and among the top ten global bottling groups. The company currently has 19 bottling plants operating in 19 provinces and cities across the country, which provide consumers with 20 brands of products covering 10 categories, including soda, juice, water, milk beverages, etc. To address the vast amounts of data brought in by high sales from multiple channels and wide markets, COFCO Coca-Cola introduced and deployed Tableau to build a unified big data platform within the company to help employees use data more efficiently and make the most of data with the power of analysis. Tableau improves the data application model by building a data platform and enabling internal and external interactions   \"According to Jin Xiaojun, General Manager of Information at COFCO Coca-Cola, \"\"We receive more than 100,000 orders every day.\nThis generates a huge amount of data.\"\" As a company dealing in a full range of beverages with sales channels all over the country, COFCO Coca-Cola has to deal with a huge amount of data from different internal and external platforms every day. COFCO Coca-Cola then realized that they needed to build a powerful data platform to quickly integrate big data so that each department could quickly obtain the data they need, analyze data and make decisions based on the results from the analysis.\" After evaluating a number of major BI platforms through months of market research, COFCO Coca-Cola found that Tableau's data processing capabilities and strong compatibility highly aligned with the company's expectations for a big data platform. After building a big data platform with Tableau, COFCO Coca-Cola achieved data integration with SALIENT, MARGIN MINDER, SAP ERP, CRM, ODS and other systems. They could carry out data analysis and sharing of the full chain of procurement, production, logistics and sales, as well as the transformation from point analysis to area analysis. In addition to powerful dynamic interaction and data analysis capabilities, Tableau provides easy operation that allows the employees at COFCO Coca-Cola to get started with Tableau quickly and improve their productivity when working with data during their daily work. Mr. Jin Xiaojun said: \"Tableau really helps us a lot. After experiencing the benefits of Tableau, the company will continue to further develop our big data business on the Tableau platform. Tableau is helping people develop the habit of using data to improve productivity   Before building a big data platform, due to a huge amount of data to process and dispersed data sources, COFCO Coca-Cola used to struggle with expensive and time-consuming underlying data organization that required huge effort and time when integrating data. By using the data platform built with ETL tools, you can now integrate the back-end data from the information system. The integrated data goes to the front-end reporting system Tableau after systematical processing and generates logically consistent analysis reports. Analysts can simply share the reports generated by Tableau with business personnel across departments by uploading them to the server. In their daily work, the business personnel need to stay on top of business information in a timely and accurate manner. However, traditional reports cannot meet their high demand for data because of lack of data interactivity. Tableau is a user-friendly tool that provides data visualization. It helps the business develop data analysis capabilities and improve its productivity. After the analyst uploads Tableau reports, the business manager can view the reports under his/her permission through the BI platform, analyze the reports based on relevant business facts and make business decisions immediately. With Tableau, employees can also analyze the data from different departments on their own, reducing the time spent on making reports and avoiding repetitive work. Ma Yan, System Integration Manager at COFCO Coca-Cola, said: \"After the big data platform was built up, with extensive adoption of Tableau in analysis areas, we found that easy access to data has improved our efficiency in data analysis, and we have seen substantial a substantial improvement in the business proficiency of our employees due to saved time.\" Tableau has created a great data analysis environment for COFCO Coca-Cola. The adoption of the big data platform started from an experiment with a single department and from there moved to more departments to eventually reach the entire company, engaging more employees in data analysis. Tableau taps into the potential of data and uses it as cornerstone for boosting future development   The introduction of Tableau also allowed COFCO Coca-Cola to develop a unified data standard. According to Lin Jie, Sales Information Manager at COFCO Coca-Cola, \u201cCOFCO Coca-Cola is a leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. Our sales department has to do complicated analysis, which is easily influenced by various factors. Tableau's exploratory analysis function greatly enhances the users' analysis capabilities and helps employees discover the business logic behind data.\" Take the sales department as an example. Currently, Tableau is mainly used for daily analysis work in the sales department. Tableau provides comprehensive data analysis capabilities. It can quickly provide conclusions from analysis. As a user-friendly tool, Tableau helps employees improve their efficiency in flexible analysis, allowing them to focus their time and effort on developing their own professional services instead of purely carrying out processing work. In addition, because a unified data standard and logic for data use have been developed, the employees can carry out data-based analysis following the same standard, thus allowing for more seamless communication and understanding. Strategies derived from the same logic are also easier to be accepted across the company. According to Mr. Lin Jie, there are two main directions for the application of data analysis: intelligent analysis and precise guidance. As the data collection methods become more and more automatic, analysis also becomes more and more intelligent. For example, intelligent forewarning can be applied in sales management; meanwhile, employees no longer need to track and find customer relationships bit by bit through reports. Instead, they can use data tools like Tableau for tracking, which will automatically figure out key groups and visualize them in reports. In the future, enterprises' demand for data analysis will rise dramatically. Only by making the most of the value created by big data can you discover substantial market opportunities. COFCO Coca-Cola believes that the true power of digital transformation comes from the ability of information to create value. For this reason, in order to remain competitive in the digital economy era, we have to make the most of data analysis and tap into the power of data. COFCO Coca-Cola is also willing to continue to advance the application and popularization of Tableau so that the power of data can be fully unlocked and utilized in the fast moving consumer goods industry.  Bizinsight (Beijing) Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Bizinsight) is China's first software enterprise and high-tech enterprise to be focused on big data collection, application, analysis and sharing. We are the gold agent of Tableau software in China and have dozens of self-developed data mining, visualization analysis and industry data integration applications. We have been dedicated to embedded analysis for 15 years and have implemented more than 100 Tableau use cases in the retail, energy, pharmaceutical and high-tech industries. As a leader in big data, we are committed to boosting the rise of Chinese enterprises."

Now in its thirty-first year, the distribution and logistics business has more than 500+ Indian branches, 10,000+ employees supporting 11,800+ franchisees and handles nearly 400,000+ shipments daily to more than 12,000 postcodes. With Tableau, DTDC has also built a data culture to navigate through the impacts of COVID-19 & come up with new business opportunities and improve its serviceability across India. DTDC kickstarted its transformation journey around 5-6 years ago with an objective to create a multi faceted organization relying on the latest technology trends and service offerings. A key element of that was to assimilate data, promoting \u2018Data Democracy\u2019 of relevant information. The pandemic accelerated the transformational program, bringing to the fore the need for a single source of truth & deeper insights of data through which agility, speed of execution could be enhanced multiple times and DTDC could take relevant decision on matters of cost and profitability. \u201cWe felt that unless we could put clear operational data into people\u2019s hands, it would become difficult to ensure that the business moves as a connected whole,\u201d says Mrinal Chakraborty, Executive Vice President, Information Technology and Innovation, DTDC Express Ltd. DTDC, in record time moved its data to the cloud with Google Cloud Platform (GCP BIGQ) and then added on Tableau Cloud for an end-to-end analytics solution. Team Computers, an Indian IT consulting firm, supported the rollout of Tableau to DTDC\u2019s entire business management team. A key benefit of DTDC\u2019s data transformation is that everyone is now on the same page when it comes to performance. Chakraborty shared that this was especially valuable with many people still working remotely and meeting virtually. \u201cWhen you are working in a decentralized environment, it is important that how everyone is looking at the same data and that there\u2019s no confusion or debate about on Availability/Authenticity/Quality of data,\u201d Chakraborty. \u201cTableau has given us this certainty and helped to unify the team around shared goals & key performance indicators.\u201d Last year, one of these goals was a return to pre-COVID profitability which DTDC was able to achieve in just nine months. Chakraborty credits this in part to Tableau implementation and thus greater visibility of performance. Citing the example of delivery delays, Chakraborty said they were able to plot data onto a map of India to understand the relative spread of the problem in a spatial scenario. In addition, satisfying the objective of data democracy deliveries which were previously monitored by operations alone were now available for all senior managers to track and take tactical and strategic decisions in order to support a better service performance. With Tableau, they can slice the information by location, product, and different service parameters. DTDC also has dashboards to track other performance metrics such as Shipment Bookings and Customer escalations (CRM Cases). By viewing these daily, senior management can tap into trends and derive actionable insights to support the team in exploring newer sources of revenue while providing exceptional customer experience to our existing customers. DTDC now plans to continue on its data journey , to ensure complete adoption of existing dashboards and information while exploring the forecasting and predictive aspects of Analytics Most of DTDC\u2019s data is structured, which will make it easy to apply machine learning and AI in the future. \u201cThe visual aspects of Tableau have helped to make our data more understandable and meaningful, and we are all now dancing to the same tune and seeing the same analysis,\u201d said Chakraborty. \u201cMy personal plan and vision is to bring more predictability into our operations, and I\u2019m keen to see that side of Tableau.\u201d "

        "company": "Telia",
        "content": "Connectivity, efficiency, and innovation. These are the words often used to define Telia, the largest telecommunications provider in the Nordics. From 5G-powered self-driving electric buses in Stockholm to leading 5G expansion across the Nordics, this $10 billion net revenue organization is creating the next generation of reliable communication solutions for millions of customers across the Nordic region. Here, Kristofer \u00c5gren, Head of Data Insights at Telia, reveals how Tableau is helping the company create new revenue streams and innovative services based on crowd movement patterns. From improving urban planning and reducing public transport CO2 emissions to slowing the spread of Covid-19 - the impact they\u2019ve made with embedded analytics is only the beginning of their data journey. As you might imagine, Telia generates vast volumes of data from our mobile network. Telia Division X was launched several years ago to capitalize on that data opportunity and incubate innovative new growth services. What we\u2019re doing today will be part of our customers\u2019 experiences tomorrow. Telia Crowd Insights is among our most powerful innovations. It uses location intelligence based on anonymized and aggregated mobility data from the Telia network. The data set comprises over 16 million subscribers across the Nordics. That\u2019s equivalent to billions of data points every day. A 2019 Ed Sheeran concert in Helsinki, for example, used Crowd Insights to understand where fans came from, how much they spent in the Helsinki area in connection to their visit, and their movements before and after the concert. The city of Helsinki gained valuable insights from this to help plan future events and provide a better experience for concertgoers. We\u2019ve used Tableau from day one, and it is at the core of Crowd Insights. Tableau is intuitive, easy to learn, and adaptive. We can quickly create dashboards, drill down into exciting new insights, and surface new ideas to our customers. Without a doubt, the visual analytics platform is an important part of enabling new data monetization products and revenue streams for Telia. Telia Crowd Insights, offers huge scopes for innovation and data-driven decision making. Telia City Vitality Insights, for example, help cities across the Nordic and Baltics to improve the urban experience by revealing anonymized and aggregated crowd movement patterns from the network data. By comparing historical data with what\u2019s happening right now, cities can measure the impact of decisions made and actions taken. Tableau makes it easier for people to explore and understand data, leading the teams to discover and share insights that make a positive impact on city planning. Likewise, when the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority, HSL, completed a \u20ac1.2 billion subway extension, it wanted to measure the commuter experience, making sure the new subway was used by as many as possible. A traditional survey would have taken years and cost thousands of euros. Telia Crowd Insights, with Tableau embedded analytics, was also able to show that the increased subway use had reduced car traffic by 8%, equivalent to 13 tonnes of CO2 per day. When we began, some argued we should develop our own analytics tool or use a solution like Power BI. However, that would take time and resources away from the true purpose of Telia\u2019s Division X: innovative product development. Tableau\u2019s embedded analytics platform allows us to focus on building new Telia services. We can integrate and customize Tableau into our external applications, providing dashboards so customers can ask questions and find meaningful insights themselves. The Swedish Public Health Authority uses our anonymized and aggregated insights with Tableau embedded analytics to understand how groups of people move in society, for example, between municipalities and regions or within a city. They can then visualize patterns that would otherwise have been difficult to detect and enables them to assess the effectiveness of measures to minimize the spread of infection. We have only scratched the surface with use cases. We will extend further into retail, for example, analyzing anonymized and aggregated data from Telia mobile networks and from retailers\u2019 Wi-Fi networks to identify crowd movement patterns within and around \u2018bricks and mortar\u2019 stores. Retailers will get an unprecedented view of their complete conversion funnel, where to put up new stores, and how the indoor movement flows truly look like."

State-of-the-art analytics and easy connectivity to a variety of data sources have helped Verizon produce a culture of excellence that anticipates and addresses customer needs across multiple touch points, including call center activities, customer contact via web apps and other digital channels, and even technicians' interactions with customers while out in the field. Maintaining customer service quality became more vital than ever with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers put increased demand on Verizon's networks. During April 2020 alone, customers placed more than 800 million calls per day\u2014double the amount at the highest peak during a typical year. Calls were an average of one-third longer, text messages spiked to 9 billion daily, gaming on the network was up by 100%, and the number of people using virtual private network (VPN) connections to do their job went up by more than 50%. These increases, combined with Verizon's own priority of keeping its work environment safe for employees, drove the customer service organization to brainstorm new ways of meeting customer needs using available resources. The team adapted their dashboards to incorporate data from the Tableau COVID-19 Data Hub, enabling them to see spikes in service demand relative to pre-COVID median levels, and adjust resources accordingly. It also helped them understand how their call data can inform them about spikes in network issues. In addition, they created new COVID-19 impact dashboards like the Call Driver Outlier and Anomaly Detection System, which helped them understand how the landscape was changing post-pandemic with respect to customers' calling behavior. The team built innovative prototypes showing heat maps of call center and technician dispatch activities, helping to identify geographic areas requiring service so the Verizon workforce could make intentional decisions about how to respond. Key to some of these activities was the Tableau COVID-19 Data Hub web data connector. \u201cUsing the web data connector, we blended Johns Hopkins University's pandemic data with our own internal customer service operations data,\u201d explains Siddharth Dayama, Senior Manager of Data Analytics and Customer Service Operations. \u201cThis helped us correlate location-based spikes in service demand with COVID-19 hotspots around the country. This ability to seamlessly bridge insights from external world macro factors to our company's internal operational metrics is a game changer and helps us better understand the impact and make informed decisions.\u201d Amid all this change, Verizon also retrained more than 20,000 retail store operators and other call center customer service employees to continue their duties from workstations in their own homes, with access to all the same dashboards and other tools needed to perform in their roles, as part of the company's home-based work platform. \u201cPersonally, I am very proud of our response capacity throughout this crisis,\u201d said Dayama. \u201cVerizon's networks withstood the additional pressure, and the company retained and retrained their professional workers\u2014all while continuing on the mission to help customers stay connected during a difficult time.\u201d The flexibility and extensibility of Verizon's Tableau platform also helped with business continuity by enabling daily reporting across departments. \u201cThe beauty of dashboards versus static reporting is that the data IS the content, so when the data changes, the content is updated automatically, showing the latest trends,\u201d Dayama explained. \u201cAnd Tableau is built for 'learning by doing'\u2014so when COVID-19 hit and we had new challenges to solve for, we could jump right in to start creating and modifying dashboards that met those needs.\u201d"

The company is committed to providing timely, accurate, and creative solutions for customers. This includes its one-day service, which means applicants can receive a financing decision within just one day of requirements being met. Like all companies in the finance sector, Mitsui Leasing must carefully manage its risk and ensure that any credit extended to customers will be paid back. Accordingly, the company carries out thorough analysis to understand customer risk profiles and inform decisions about each loan application. Sandi Saebatul, Risk Management Unit Head at Mitsui Leasing, leads the team that carries out this analysis. Saebatul joined the company in 2015, and based on support from Mitsui Leasing Management one of the first things he did was bring in Tableau. His previous employer used Tableau for financial analysis, and he knew the benefits could apply to risk management. Mitsui Leasing rolled out Tableau with the help of PC Data Visidata Anugerah Mitra, PT and now has sixteen users across Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server. Each user has authenticated access, and Mitsui Leasing has strict policies in place for data storage and governance. Those using Tableau at Mitsui Leasing are mainly senior managers within the Risk Management Unit. They prepare analysis for teams like marketing and operations and present the findings back to them during meetings or webinars. In total, Mitsui Leasing has 177 visualizations, with most of its analysis aimed at understanding customers and providing them with the best solutions. One of the outcomes of this has been the ability to determine a customer\u2019s risk level more quickly and whether their application should be approved or if further due diligence is needed. They can also improve the accuracy of financing decisions and make better decisions about how to structure customers\u2019 payments. If a customer defaults on their obligations, Mitsui Leasing works with them to develop a corrective action plan and visualizes progress against this in Tableau. Looking at these visualizations, it typically takes just three months for the company to assess if a plan is working. In addition, monitoring customer defaults regularly helps Mitsui Leasing understand the impact of certain strategies and its credit scoring accuracy. In the future, Mitsui Leasing plans to analyze broader and more comprehensive data. It also plans to do more predictive analysis to understand new opportunities and risks and predict future performance. "

        "content": "When a child falls ill while travelling on holiday, the family calls SOS International\u2019s 24/7 call centre to get urgent help. The company is one of the leading assistance organizations in the Nordic region. From its alarm centres in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, they provide much-needed assistance to travellers worldwide on behalf of their insurance companies, night and day, all year round. Here, Troels Bohnsen, Head of Business Intelligence at SOS International, discusses the critical role of data within the company and how Tableau helps them uncover new operational insights that are significantly improving its global service offerings. We offer a wide range of services in the form of worldwide travel and roadside assistance, and healthcare solutions. Our goal is to secure value for our customers - the insurance companies - while simultaneously providing the best service possible to end-users - the travellers. Relevant data-driven insights enable us to be more informed in our decision making across the organization, which benefits both our customers and end-users. Our journey began around six years ago. At the time, we relied on basic spreadsheets for most of our analytics, which was causing issues with data consistency. We had different numbers in every meeting! As a result, our management team requested the establishment of a group-wide Business Intelligence function to create a single source of truth that would eliminate these issues. The first stage was building a modern and sustainable data warehouse, which significantly improved data transparency. To help us in this process we entered a strategic cooperation with Data Inc., who provides Datawarehouse as a Service. Next, we needed to implement an analytics platform that enabled us to deliver data and key insights to business users in a fast and effective way. We looked at numerous different solutions but quickly settled on Tableau because it was one of the only platforms that offered a server for publishing reports, which was important. Following implementation, we re-labelled our Tableau Server as SOS Report, which is what it\u2019s known as throughout the company today. We currently have around 600 unique Tableau users, equating to roughly 60% of our full-time workforce. Firstly, it allows us to extract much more value from our data and put key insights directly into the hands of relevant employees throughout the business. For instance, we had a tremendous amount of phone data from our alarm centres that we couldn\u2019t analyze effectively. Now, we can visualize relevant data in Tableau in order to analyze it and quickly spot trends. We are also able to identify hotspots for vehicle breakdowns, peak hours in our alarm centres, and cost outliers, all of which we have used to refine our worldwide services. Tableau also helps us to improve our data governance, allowing us to tightly control access to data and reports within SOS International. Only seeing relevant data enhances the experience for business users whilst ensuring the company adheres to all regulatory requirements as efficiently as possible. Finally, it has dramatically expanded the kind of analytics we can do. We\u2019ve started using self-service analytics to bring data to employees in new ways, via a platform that lets them explore data themselves. Not only has this improved the user experience in the business, but it\u2019s also enabled us to distinguish between different user needs as well. For instance, some prefer to be presented with insights via a dashboard, while others - such as analysts - want to dig into data themselves. Understanding these different needs is incredibly powerful. We\u2019re currently looking at advanced analytics techniques to extract even more value from our data. A great example is the adoption of better predictive data at our alarm centres, which improves the service our employees provide to customers while also reducing costs. Besides that, we continue to expand the use of Tableau and data throughout SOS International, driving more informed, data-based decision making at every level of the company."

        "content": "Signet Jewelers is an international jewelry retailer operating more than 3,000 stores, including Zales, Kay Jewelers, and Jared, in the US, UK, and Canada. In today's ever-changing retail landscape, Signet works tirelessly to keep pace with evolving consumer buying patterns, remain responsive to ecommerce trends, and optimize physical stores to maximize sales. Signet wanted to take advantage of its vast amounts of consumer retail data\u2014a principal advantage it wields over the smaller stores that represent much of its competition\u2014all while reducing its operational spend on IT deployment and maintenance projects. When it came to data, historically, departments functioned mostly in silos and had varying knowledge of what was actually happening in the field. This led to a rise in \u201cshadow IT\u201d with various business groups standing up independent data solutions using their own vendors. Among other issues, this put a burden on the IT team to learn and understand these many disparate systems in order to provide more centralized support. IT's focus became more reactive than proactive\u2014always taking time to address the immediate issues, leaving less time to strategize long-term and company-wide. Signet's IT team consolidated data into a new enterprise data warehouse (EDW), which users connect to using Alteryx to prepare the data for consumption. The team then built a series of starter dashboards in Tableau to create a comprehensive view of the business, starting in the real estate business unit, where quicker access to information now enables greater agility and flexibility with lease negotiations. As more people accessed these dashboards through Tableau Cloud (powered by AWS), news began to spread across the company. Over the course of two years, Tableau adoption continued to grow and KPI dashboards now get thousands of views. For example, the business planning team leverages Tableau to quickly compare revenue versus forecast for millions of SKUs in seconds. The merchandising team uses Tableau to give merchants near-real-time access to stock inventory and merchandise popularity data. This new analytics deployment with Tableau has yielded many benefits. Signet has seen reduced time-to-market, lower IT overhead costs, and created more self-service analytics capabilities. In the case of one maintenance dashboards, using Tableau saved Signet more than $250,000 by transforming the team's ability to find data patterns. Elsewhere, using Tableau to analyze more than 75 million point-of-sale transactions led to identifying an opportunity worth more than $10 million. Providing strategic insights in hours rather than days or weeks has also transformed decision making at Signet and enabled leadership to take swift corrective action during key selling periods. While centralizing much of Signet's data into the new EDW, Signet's use of Tableau has also empowered the individual departments to have more autonomy in building and maintaining their own dashboards. The newly-formed Enterprise Analytics team, which grew out of early innovations of the real estate division, meets regularly with each department to advise and consult on data projects using Tableau. It also hosts a Data Governance Committee where IT gains new insights into business strategy and the analytics team socializes new technologies like Tableau and Alteryx. In addition, the team has built an Analytics Center of Excellence that holds quarterly meetings to showcase various dashboards and help departments share best practices with one another. Using Tableau to help build this data-focused culture, where every employee can be a citizen data scientist, has contributed to the success of Signet's \u201cPath to Brilliance\u201d\u2014a commitment to be customer-first and omnichannel, and to achieve a culture of agility and efficiency."

        "company": "National Trust",
        "content": "As businesses brace against the growing economic headwinds caused by the pandemic, time begins to look more and more like a precious commodity. The pressure to innovate is only increasing while ongoing uncertainty necessitates effective decision-making. Companies who have invested in their data culture early are likely to be in a stronger position to weather the storm. Here, the National Trust\u2019s Christina Finlay (Director of Data and Insight), Sarah Turner (Head of BI and Insight Delivery), Richard Clayton (Head of Data and Data Science) and Jamie Preston (Lead Ranger) discuss how their data culture is helping the charity tackle today\u2019s challenges with greater intelligence and efficiency. Editor's note: This article originally appeared in The Economist. This is an abridged version of that story - read more on the Tableau blog. Jamie Preston, a National Trust lead ranger for London and the South East, faced a problem. Every time he sat at his computer to work out budgets, he lost hours and hours trying to interpret data. Conservation had always been his passion, making him perfectly suited to the role of a ranger - the main responsibilities of which include the preservation of functioning and resilient ecosystems on the lands owned by the Trust. But as with many jobs, the role of ranger has changed over the past decade. With the aim of delivering more public benefit in an increasingly digital age, the digitisation of internal processes has been widespread. As a result, even careers that were once considered hands on now require a certain level of technical competency. For less tech-savvy workers, this can be a hugely stressful experience which translates into significantly diminished efficiency and output. Sarah Turner, head of business intelligence and insight delivery at the National Trust, explains that Mr Preston\u2019s experience was far from unique: it was emblematic of a wider issue within the organisation. \u201cWe knew we needed to do more with our data, and there was broad agreement across the various arms of the organisation that investing in a better data analytics system would enable us to be more effective in delivering far-reaching positive change.\u201d The goal, explains Christina Finlay, director of data and insight at the Trust, was to become a data-enabled organisation. \u201cFor the Trust, this meant being evidence-based in the way we make our decisions and enabling all employees to be informed by data in their decision-making\u201d. Over a period of just 18 months the National Trust has done just that, integrating a visual data analytics platform across the business to make it both quicker and easier for employees to get the insight they need. \u201cWhen you implement any large-scale operational change in a company,\u201d Ms Turner says, \u201cyou expect to encounter some resistance. But in our case, it was the opposite. The technology was so intuitive that almost straight away people were reporting an improvement in their job satisfaction, even among those whose jobs were not desk-based\u201d. Ms Turner believes that the key to success was in the application of change management theory. \u201cWe identified change champions who were bringing diverse levels and departments together in a cross-functional project team,\u201d she explains, and implemented changes based on their examples of success. The biggest impact was how the new data analytics strategy empowered workers, no matter their role, to make data-based decisions on their own. The effects reached even those working outside of the central office. For rangers like Mr Preston it has meant less time sitting in front of a computer and more time focusing on conservation. \u201cIn previous years I would have been biting my fingernails and asking lots of questions of others,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now the software allows me to find those answers myself\u201d. 2020 has been a transformative year. Existing technological infrastructures were stress-tested as remote working became a necessity. For organisations like the National Trust, whose income depends on people buying memberships to physically access and explore the special places in its care, the impact of a national lockdown was immediate and dramatic. Overnight, teams across the organisation had to rethink their entire strategy in order to deliver products and services that were more relevant in the new context. Supported by an analytics platform that was accessible and easy to use and a data strategy that championed data-based decision making, meant employees could analyse relevant information at speed. This bolstered its ability to respond to the rapidly changing government advice, explains Richard Clayton, head of data and data science at the National Trust. When lockdown began to ease, the Trust was able to reopen its sites quickly and implement new rules and booking systems with efficiency. \u201cWe knew we were going to be able to reopen and we knew we would have to put some restrictions in place to be able to do so,\u201d explains Ms Finlay. \u201cThe decision to introduce a booking system was a heart-wrenching one for us. But once it was made, we were able to pull together a team from all across the organisation\u2014IT, operations, data, marketing and communications\u2014and within two weeks we had a totally new system in place.\u201d Not only that, but the ease of access to new data meant that the Trust could also monitor implementation closely and make adjustments where necessary. \u201cThe speed at which we were able to get this totally new source of data through to reporting was revolutionary for us,\u201d comments Ms Finlay, \u201cand demonstrates how much progress we\u2019ve made as a business\u201d."

        "title": "Oneflare leverages a single source of truth to increase sales revenue by 270%",
        "company": "Oneflare",
        "content": "Oneflare is an Australian start-up that connects customers to businesses across 300 categories, ranging from plumbers and electricians to pet groomers and interior designers. As a rapidly scaling business, Oneflare relies on data to make key decisions such as when to hire, where to invest, and how much to charge. The business also uses data to engage and focus its team, and it has sent sales soaring through its use of gamification. Tableau is central to Oneflare's data culture. It brings together nearly 130 data sources into a single source of truth and has increased efficiency and visibility of performance. It has also helped to achieve triple digital revenue growth.                             Before adopting Tableau, Oneflare was using numerous platforms and channels for analysis and reporting, which made it difficult to measure and forecast performance accurately. In addition, there was increasing pressure on Oneflare's Insights team as they responded to growing requests for new reports and different views of data. The business sought a solution that would simplify data analytics and empower everyone to do more analysis and discovery on their own. Oneflare chose to implement Tableau because of its flexibility and also its simple and intuitive interface. It made it easy for everyone to move between a macro and micro view of their data and find answers to different questions. It also enabled greater visibility of performance and alignment around the business' KPIs. \"As a start-up, it's ingrained in our culture that everyone knows and understands our higher business goals and how they contribute to them. With Tableau as our single source of truth, everyone is more aligned on these KPIs,\"Marco Maizener, Head of Insights at Oneflare. Oneflare now has 205 custom workbooks in Tableau which help it to understand customers on both sides of its marketplace and to pull the right levers to balance supply and demand. For example, with a view of uptake across categories, it can make strategic decisions about pricing and identify where to direct its sales and marketing efforts. Oneflare is also using Tableau to motivate the sales team by blending performance data from multiple sources and presenting it in a gamified view. This has helped to drive healthy competition amongst reps and contributed to an 81 percent increase in sales volume per sales rep and a 270 percent increase in revenue. The performance of marketing has also been improved as a result of being able to drill down into past campaigns to understand how these can be optimised in the future. For instance, the marketing team can now see which channels work best for promoting different categories on the Oneflare site. They can also optimise their Search Engine Marketing. Riley Spratt, Marketing Specialist at Oneflare, said Tableau's visualisations were invaluable in stitching together data from multiple channels and extracting more significant insights.                             Oneflare's marketing team is one of several that has benefited from the efficiency Tableau provides. It takes just minutes to visualise the performance of individual campaigns, and the team has saved one day per week on reporting. Another area where Oneflare has saved time is on the calculation of commissions. Prior to using Tableau, this process involved multiple reports and spreadsheets and took a minimum of four full working days to complete. Now, it takes less than four hours per month, saving 300 hours per year. Testing of Oneflare's data pipeline has also been made easier as Tableau is able to handle better the large amount of data generated by the marketplace. The efficiencies gained through these use cases and others help Oneflare to work more productively and focus on growing the business. Oneflare is tapping into additional insights from Tableau to streamline the customer journey and eliminate potential points of drop off. It has also developed a Coronavirus Crisis dashboard to track newly relevant metrics and keep on top of shifts in the market. Financial forecasting is another priority and Oneflare is using Tableau together with Python to make more accurate predictions about customer lifetime value and monthly results. \"Our goal now is to increase our financial data maturity and move from analysing data to predicting data. That's the future, and that's our next step,\" said Maizener."

        "title": "The Municipality of Nijmegen uses Tableau to make informed, data-driven decisions on local policies and developments",
        "company": "Municipality of Nijmegen",
        "content": "Nijmegen is the oldest city in the Netherlands, and the country\u2019s tenth largest municipality. Located between the German Ruhr area and the Randstad, Nijmegen holds an important position in the international economy. Danique Haas and Arjen Verhulst, Data Analysts at the Municipality of Nijmegen, are building an internal data culture, one department at a time. They discuss how their organization uses Tableau to gain insights in local developments, evaluate policies and to make timelier, data-driven decisions. For us, it is all about insights. The safety department, for example, needs insights on a strategic and a tactical level. Insights into safety or public spaces helps us not only to plan services or maintenance, but also to analyse trends that inform conversations and even future policies. When looking at reports about nuisance behaviour, waste or broken streetlights, for example, we can compare which resources or areas are impacted more than others. This may prompt further investigation or discussions with local parties and stakeholders. A special investigating officer (buitengewoon opsporingsambtenaar (boa)) can take action in their district. Our citizens know they are being listened to because they see the municipality taking action more quickly. Tableau really helps our policymakers to see and understand their data. Visual analytics helps them to analyse trends in the municipality, and to map local developments at the district or even street level. This is hugely valuable information when evaluating policies and goals, and of course when working on new plans and policies. Calibration and recalibration is now more frequent with the help of Tableau. Policymakers review weekly instead of monthly, allowing them to be much more agile in their work. We see a huge impact in Social Care (the Social Domain), where almost half of the municipal budget goes. It\u2019s crucial to be able to account for expenditure as much as possible. A good example is a recent healthcare project where we needed to limit the number of referrals to individual custom facilities. This would ensure public funds are targeted, effective and would reduce costs, meaning the citizens receive the best quality care possible. Pulling from our data warehouse, we used Tableau to benchmark against KPIs. These insights were then used in the reporting for the intervention plan, providing a clear overview of objectives and results. Tableau makes life easier for our BI specialists; they previously had to manually tinker in Excel, but now Tableau provides an automatically updated view. The BI teams are actively monitoring the impact of the pandemic on the municipality. We\u2019re analysing pedestrian footfall sensors closely, for example. This data is very important when enforcing 1.5-meter social distancing. Tableau is helping us share insights with local entrepreneurs and businesses to give them a better understanding of the state of play compared to last year, such as analysing how busy the streets are. The data is shared via the municipality\u2019s Tableau Public page and the Stads- en Wijkmonitor, helping local businesses make informed, data-driven decisions. As an organization we are always exploring the possibilities and opportunities of using data, both internally and for external communication. We also work with Tableau partner Infotopics, who support us with the management of licences and Tableau Server \u2013 but also help us train employees, both in the classroom as through training on the job. More and more employees see how data helps to evaluate policies and to make informed decisions. Having a trusted data source and \u2018one single source of truth\u2019 allows departments to accelerate their decision-making cycle. Employees want to learn to work better with data and dashboards. That is why the organization is actively investing in training, and why we are keeping our fingers on the pulse to offer support where needed. We continuously monitor dashboard supply and demand and ensure optimal functionality and user friendliness. As a result, employees are finding actionable insights that actively improve policy and decision-making. The biggest challenge is to decide what data to include and how to tell the data story. What works for us is to discuss ways of working in a classroom setup. We then literally show employees the basics of exploring and interacting with data, but also challenge them by making them look for specific information in the dataset, using real-life issues in a specific district. We also work in sprints, as we do with our Scrum methodology. This allows us to realign and adjust every four weeks and gives us the opportunity to talk to employees regularly. That dialogue is beneficial for all parties involved - we can iterate on previous dashboards and improve data processes that aren\u2019t running as they should. For us as data analysts it is really useful to stay in touch with so many different user groups. It helps us learn about their similarities and differences, ultimately helping serve them and the municipality better. Every department can gain something by being data-driven, enabling new ways of working to improve our processes and services. More and more departments are realizing the impact these insights have and ask us about Tableau. As for the future, we\u2019d like to introduce more predictive analytics. For example, understanding the cost of the Youth Social Support Act (Wet maatschappelijke ondersteuning), or analyzing parking turnover and sales, such as parking rates versus visits, and how much revenue the municipality will receive."

        "content": "The State of Indiana Management Performance Hub (MPH) is a state agency focused on improving the quality of life for the people of Indiana through data sharing, innovation, and collaboration. The agency, run by the Indiana governor's office under the Indiana Office of Management and Budget, promotes data-driven policy that optimizes user experience and decision making while also driving public data transparency. Nonprofits, other government agencies, and everyday citizens can all visit MPH online to get the data they need for grant writing, policy advocacy, community plan development, and other program purposes. In some cases, MPH produces data visualizations in response to user requests in areas such as education, state finances, and public health. MPH doesn't host the data itself, but rather makes a multitude of data sets and visualizations available for public use based on these requests. Before Tableau, MPH was using business intelligence tools that ultimately proved hard to administer. In 2015, MPH began using Tableau to create visualizations that helped end users more easily shape their expectations of the data they wanted to use. The results were positive, but because Microsoft Excel was the primary data preparation tool, MPH still spent a lot of time cleansing data in individual spreadsheets and then reloading the spreadsheets into Tableau. This was inefficient, and detracted from the overall user experience. By the time a solution was ready to test, the requirements had often changed, making it a struggle for MPH analysts to keep customers engaged in the process. The agency needed a more agile workflow that could deliver visualizations closer to the speed of thought. MPH was an early adopter of Tableau Prep, which they used to easily build and automate flows for multiple data sets in their Tableau workbooks. Creating pipelines in Prep Builder empowered non-ETL users for the first time to explore data sets, create data flows, and manipulate data to gain new insights. Based on this success, the agency began looking at ways to gain further efficiency by automating data flows. Using Tableau Prep Conductor (part of Tableau Data Management) MPH can now schedule, monitor, and administer the data flows to save developers time and ensure end users have current data. And with Tableau Catalog\u2019s data lineage feature, MPH can more quickly identify and resolve errors. As Josh Martin, Chief Data Officer at MPH explained, \u201cpreviously, when a workbook error occurred, we had to backtrack, find the faulty data source, and find the error within that data. Now we\u2019re able to resolve it much faster.\u201d The results: a more interactive user experience, faster analytics solution development, proactive data bug detection and resolution, and new dashboards driving more than 150 calculations across dozens of data sources to support 41 metrics statewide. For example, the state's Career Connections and Talent (CCT) agency had more than 35 data sources in a variety of formats. MPH took 29 of those data sources and turned them into a single data flow in Tableau Prep Builder. This enabled easier data manipulation that could increase accessibility, organize data across customizable geographic regions, and inform new priorities and decision making. Streamlining the data flow also translated to a reduction in real-time visualization rendering from an average of 16 seconds down to six seconds\u2014a 56% increase in processing power overall. Many states, including Indiana, have open data laws. Indiana stands out as one of few US states with legislation that creates an agency focused on leveraging data as a strategic asset. Using Tableau, MPH has matured its data culture to be nimbler on data projects and more engaged with users' needs. MPH empowers Indiana residents to access public data, and use it to answer important questions and tell deeper, more engaging stories."

        "company": "KoomMin KB bank",
        "content": "KB Kookmin Bank (KB) is an acknowledged leader in Korean finance, managing the largest domestic customer base with the highest market share in assets and investment trusts. KB\u2019s focus on customers has long supported its outstanding performance and helped cement its reputation as a trustworthy brand ranked top in the banking sector in National Customer Satisfaction Index (NCSI) for the thirteenth year running in 2019. Data plays a critical role in enabling KB to respond to the urgent changes sweeping the finance industry. KB has become a leader of data culture in the first-tier banking sector by implementing visualization-based self-service BI and expanding it across the whole organization. Against the backdrop of rising internal demands for utilizing data in the business area including financial customers and service improvements, KB introduced and expanded Tableau so that business employees without IT knowledge can perform data analysis and derive substantial insight. After adopting Tableau, KB implemented an enterprise-wide data-driven decision-making system, which is an essential element of supporting a data culture. Employees are now able to make decisions through Tableau based on data-based facts, rather than personal experience or intuition. This meets the needs for data and analysis critical for business operation, while also helping to get people engaged in discussions based on actual performance data and to challenge new ideas. What\u2019s more, it supports risk management by automatically adjusting analysis targets according to the changing market conditions and readily available data analysis. Tableau automates the reporting work and enables all employees to create reports at the speed of their thoughts and share them, thus accelerating growth and improvement. The importance of data and analysis to innovation in Korean finance is increasing daily rapidly. KB has successfully created an industry-leading data culture. That is, it adopted Tableau and expanded it across the organization so that the employees in all business departments of the main office can use increasingly complex data to make decisions on their own and drive business growth. As a result, it has accelerated its data journey and secured competitiveness. Before the adoption of Tableau, all employees in business departments used to depend on the IT department to extract and analyze data and develop reports. In addition, extensive SQL training requirements slowed down analysis in the field, impacting data utilization. Furthermore, as the existing BI system was highly dependent on IT, it had limitations in quickly meeting the needs of employees in the field. KB, which implemented the big data platform in June 2018, adopted Tableau on a small scale and expanded it in December 2018. As a result, business employees can now readily use Tableau, whereas before they would have needed to first gain professional-level skills in data analysis. In 2018 PLAN-iT, a Korean Gold Tableau Partner took charge of the big data platform establishment at KB and made success case of implementing self-service BI in the first-tier banking industry. In the process of this project, the business employees of KB received support from PLAN-iT. They experienced developing reports that meet their need for analysis information. In other words, the bank\u2019s analysis proficiency improved across its workforce. After the adoption of Tableau, KB employees became able to use data as strategic assets and make data-driven decisions. Employees in business departments now use Tableau to connect to heterogeneous data marts, easily extract the data they need and derive insight through intuitive, detailed visualization functions at the speed of thought. Business employees readily share their Tableau dashboards with bosses and executives. The lack of resources before the adoption of Tableau impeded data analysis. Now, business employees use Tableau to validate new ideas with data. KB has expanded its use of Tableau in a top-down style under the powerful leadership of its executive team to transition into a data-driven organization. It has expanded the scope of Tableau utilization from the Data Planning Department to all departments of the main office and its local branches. In other words, distinct to KB, more employees use Tableau in all business departments. Plus, its main office and nationwide branch network share the common goal of improving business with data, while the main office shares performance analysis results with branches so that they can check them in real-time. Lee Min-hye, head of the Data Planning Department of KB, said with emphasis, \u201cKB is leading the data culture by adopting Tableau, the visualization-based self-service BI platform, across all our branches nationwide. Executives and managers are now able to prioritize data using Tableau when making decisions. Tableau pushes the boundary of experience in the finance industry, where data has a close connection with innovation.\u201d Lee Yeong-Seon, Data Planning Department, KB, said, \u201cTableau has further expanded our data culture across the organization, and it is helping employees to have more impact on influencing others with data. This is shown in community activities, data visualization lab researches and the wide distribution of best practice.\u201d To respond better to changing trends in the financial industry, the business employees of KB wanted to do their work based on objective data. The executives of KB needed to encourage all employees to improve their data literacy to lead financial innovation. They firstly had to adjust their business priorities according to changes in market conditions, and then derive highly executable insight by attempting new analysis projects. Tableau is a self-service BI platform that supports quick decision-making based on accurate data. Regardless of department, Tableau provides all employees with data analysis opportunities, e.g. number of customers, counsel, accounts/products and regional performance. Business employees actively use Tableau to seize new growth opportunities and manage potential risks. A typical use case is making, updating and sharing dashboards on current business situation and management agenda, contributing to expand customer base. Tableau also helped considerably in enabling a rapid response across the enterprise to ensure resiliency with data-driven decisions to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Executives are practising data-driven decision-making. They are checking real-time changes in Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and management status data in the dashboard and reflecting them in their business plans. A KB official said, \u201cTableau helps us stay flexible in our decisions by getting everyone on the same page quickly on data that are highly valuable. When we carry out new businesses, we expect that we will be able to make a judgment using existing performance data. Also, we look forward to creating a working environment that verifies performance with data.\u201d Employees of departments in the headquarter are supporting each other\u2019s business while sharing product analysis results through Tableau. While once only those departments which led customer and marketing analysis using the analysis results, now they can get new ideas based on the reports of other departments, which were shared on the integrated analysis platform implemented with Tableau. A KB official said, \u201cEach department makes more efficient decisions while preventing duplicate analysis through the Tableau platform.\u201d KB had to spend a significant amount of time in complicated and repetitive manual work from data query, extraction, cleansing and analysis to report development for regular reporting task. In a given time, they could make only a paper report, and also there was a limitation in report formats that they can produce. Also, they could not put the results of the exploratory analysis conducted from new perspectives in a report. Through the Tableau-based automated self-service reporting process, employees of all departments of KB were able to improve their business productivity significantly. Tableau automatically queries, extracts, analyzes, and updates data on behalf of business employees to conduct reporting work. As a result, the bank was able to substantially reduce the time required for repetitive report development and editing. Through the Tableau-based automated reporting system, KB now has the resources and capacity it needs for monitoring work to take place on a monthly basis, rather than quarterly, as used to be the case. That data is now updated daily and the time required for report development and implementation reduced from a few weeks to 2~3 days, enhancing business efficiency significantly. Tableau has helped reduce the time spent on reporting by 10,000 hours a year and enabled employees to concentrate more on strategic and critical work. Through Tableau, the business employees now access and analyze data and find answers at the speed of thought, and make analysis results into a report, in compliance with their data utilization and reporting requirements. They are overcoming the restrictions of existing report formats, conducting various analyses, and carrying out in-depth analysis on any insights they gained. What\u2019s more, to solve current business problems, employees now feel empowered to take on visualization projects, improving business efficiency by generating differentiated insights. The executives and business employees utilize all reporting contents in real-time through various kinds of dashboards shared on the mobile and web, including key performance data, the results of analyzing key indexes for individual departments and other visual analysis results. Tableau gives employees more opportunities to discuss reporting contents anytime and anywhere. A KB official said, \u201cThrough the convenient reporting process built on Tableau, we reinforced the agile decision-making system.\u201d PLAN-iT Partners provides a total BI service from the initial stages of defining the indicator tree to designing BI platform and developing BI system.

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Accor offers the largest brand portfolio in the hotel industry, comprised of internationally acclaimed luxury and premium brands as well as popular midscale and economy brands. In 2015, Accor Luxury and Premium brands acquired FRHI Hotels & Resorts (Fairmont, Raffles, and Swissotel), significantly extending its presence in the luxury and premium segment. At the time of the acquisition, each of the 100+ hotels were operating its own set of manual data reports, taking a lot of time and resources to maintain. In this interview, filmed onsite in their Paris offices, Geoffray Maugin, SVP Global Guest Experience & Business Performance, and Nicolas Leseurre, Director of Planning and Analytics, discuss how Tableau Cloud (powered by AWS) has helped to improve business decisions and data accessibility throughout the Luxury and Premium brands division. Accor is a global hotel management company, boasting an extensive portfolio of nine world-class brands and over 600 hotels. In order to effectively manage such a large and diverse group, we need equally world-class dashboards that enable our hotels to drive activity, improve quality and promote customer loyalty wherever possible. As such, access to fast, accurate data insights is key. This is especially true in Luxury and Premium brands, where customer loyalty is so crucial. This high-end segment is very important when it comes to uncovering in-depth insights and delivering a level of service that elevates our brands above those of our competitors. Our journey began with the acquisition of three iconic hotel brands - Fairmont Hotels, Raffle Hotels & Swissotel. As part of the integration process, we took over a series of reporting activities for these new hotels and quickly identified a series of problems. Primarily, each hotel had its own set of reports, which had to be updated manually. With over 100 hotel properties involved, this added up to a significant number of reports! Not only did the volume lead to excessive running costs and reporting delays, but the high risk of errors during the manual updating process was causing a lot of dissatisfaction amongst end-users. Centralizing everything through Tableau Cloud quickly led to dramatic improvements. Time spent updating and delivering reports dropped from 10 days to just two hours. We also used Tableau Bridge (which allows dashboards published to Tableau Cloud to maintain live connections to any data sources behind a firewall) to create a single reporting process for all hotels, further increasing its impact throughout the company. Our end users now have fast, easy access to a wide range of diversified KPIs in Tableau Cloud, giving them a 360-degree view of everything in a single location, as opposed to multiple platforms. We have also used Tableau Cloud\u2019s extensive functionality to revamp the guiding principles of all our reports, allowing us to use visualizations to tell stories between different dashboards. We have already managed to unify data as diverse as Financials, Quality, Distribution, and Social Media through Tableau Cloud. Soon, we will add data sources from other business areas such as Sustainable Development, Loyalty or Food & Beverage. The consolidated views at the country, regional, brand and global levels help us to drive better performance across the board, which is huge. User feedback has also been very positive, both at the hotel level and at the corporate brand level. Everyone loves Tableau\u2019s highly visual approach and how easy it is to filter information to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for. The more people we have using Tableau Cloud, the more effective it becomes throughout the business. As such, user buy-in is absolutely critical. To help us in this process, we ran a series of comprehensive training webinars with end-users explaining how to use Tableau Cloud effectively and what they can find within each of the dashboards and reports. A key benefit of Tableau Cloud is that it tracks user activity, which allows me to check who has connected to it and what reports they have viewed. I can then follow up with users individually and make sure they get the information they need. If not, I can show them how to do it so they know for the future. Firstly, the agility of the platform. You can start with raw data that you\u2019ve just collected and quickly turn it into rich visualizations that enable fast, intuitive analytics. Secondly, the ease of use of the platform. In just a few days users can go from being complete novices to creating high-level dashboards and visualizations all by themselves. Thirdly, the partners working with Tableau. Thanks to the support from Actinvision we quickly reached our reporting and analytics targets, learning a great deal along the way. Finally, the community. Tableau is supported by a passionate, friendly online community around the world. This means we have access to expert knowledge and information whenever we need it, helping ensure our data analytics goals can always be achieved."

        "content": "SIAM KUBOTA Corporation is one of Thailand\u2019s largest companies and specializes in manufacturing, sales, and leasing of construction and farming equipment. The company also has a research and development arm which is focused on driving advancements in agriculture and farm management. This includes helping farmers to monitor their crops using IoT and data visualizations. Data has always been key to decision-making at SIAM KUBOTA Corporation and, with the introduction of Tableau, the company has elevated its data culture. Spreadsheets and presentations have been replaced with Tableau visualizations and data can be accessed in real-time by those who need it. Less than six months after going live with Tableau, SIAM KUBOTA Corporation has achieved significant time savings by automating dashboards and has added new dimensions to data analysis. New visualizations support the business to better forecast sales and manage risk and help to accelerate innovation in IoT. With SIAM KUBOTA Corporation\u2019s previous approach to analytics, it took hours of manual effort to model data and create visualizations that could be presented back to management. The company wanted to increase the ease and speed of analytics so that it could leverage its benefits more fully. Methee Srisupundit at SIAM KUBOTA Corporation was promoted into the role of Senior Information Technology Department Manager to lead this data transformation. Finding an analytics solution was the first step and he and his team chose Tableau because of its visualization capabilities and ease of use. The company started with Tableau Server but quickly moved to Tableau Cloud to take advantage of the scalable processing power and automatic upgrades. It also made it easier to provide access to new users. \u201cRather than continually updating dashboards for the same use case, we can build one visualization that can be refreshed automatically,\u201d said Srisupundit. \u201cIt means our stakeholders no longer need to wait for data. With Tableau Cloud, people can just log on and all the information they need is there and can be visualized all on one page.\u201d The time that used to be spent building dashboards has been redirected to expanding the use of Tableau and showing people across the business how they can filter and analyze their own data. This has led to the quick adoption of Tableau and there are now around 200 employees involved in SIAM KUBOTA Corporation\u2019s Tableau ecosystem, including 80 who have a role in creating visualizations. The company is focused on training and empowering more and is using Tableau for a number of internal-use cases including sales forecasting, monitoring manufacturing lines, customer segmentation analysis, and making predictions about customer repurchase behavior. SIAM KUBOTA Corporation is also using Tableau to visualize data collected from IoT devices in the fields of its farming customers. When the company first began helping farmers leverage IoT, it relied on a programmer to create and edit visualizations. Now, that programmer has been freed up to focus on data collection and visualizations can be created and shared with customers much faster. SIAM KUBOTA Corporation went live with Tableau in April 2020 and one of the first visualizations created was used to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on employees. The company has 3,000 employees and wanted to know on a daily basis whether they were healthy or had any symptoms. A Google Form was set up with a short questionnaire for employees to complete daily and the results were initially compiled manually. Now, the data flows straight from Google into Tableau instead and the visualization is refreshed automatically. This has saved the company a half-day, every day on analysis. The COVID-19 dashboard also helped the management team to understand the value of Tableau, and Srisupundit and his team are now responding to requests for additional visualizations. \u201cThe next step for us is to drive the use of data even deeper into our culture so that it starts to grow organically. This will help us to look at the business through different dimensions and give us more insights to serve our customers.\u201d"

        "company": "Wolseley Canada",
        "content": "Wolseley Canada is the country\u2019s leading national distributor of plumbing, HVAC/R, and PVF products, employing more than 2,400 people at 220 locations across Canada and serving residential, commercial, and industrial trade customers. Wolseley Canada is subsidiary of the multinational Ferguson plc (FERG) that has revenues of roughly $20B. In recent years, the Wolseley Canada data team has proven its ability to predict revenue trends tied to indicators in the Canadian housing market. Building on that analytics success, the team began creating reports to advise the various business groups on expected changes in market performance. At first, the reports were static and had limited value because of the lag time required to create them manually. The reports also lacked the ability to maneuver within the data to drill down and discover additional insights. \u201cYou really couldn't sort or do anything with them,\u201d said Danylo Pawluk, Director of Enterprise Data & Analytics. \u201cThere were no charts, no graphs, not even color-coding\u2014just a strict, tabular PDF report.\u201d  To modernize, Wolseley Canada tried leveraging its legacy performance management and BI solution. However, product limitations around data connectivity and ease of creating visualizations eventually led them to Tableau Cloud (powered by AWS). Danylo's team followed a traditional RFP process where they evaluated several products. In a game-changing moment during a presentation to executives, they used Tableau Cloud to answer questions in real-time, even providing executives with tablet devices in the meeting so they could view and play with the visualizations in the dashboard. Danylo credits the dynamic and interactive nature of Tableau\u2019s visualizations as a breakthrough in achieving executive buy-in to replace Wolseley Canada's legacy system with Tableau Cloud. Following the methodology of Tableau Blueprint, Wolseley Canada promoted the adoption of Tableau Cloud by creating interest and excitement within teams across the organization. They allocated licenses efficiently by assigning one of the flexible role options that Tableau offers (Viewer, Creator, or Explorer) to match each user's needs. Currently, Wolseley Canada is using Data Catalog, part of Tableau Data Management, to create contextual descriptions and alerts that further streamline data analytics and operations. The transformation to Tableau Cloud has led to greater agility and coordination across Wolseley Canada's business groups, enabled by data sharing. Sales reps can see at a glance how their portfolio is performing, with data pulled and blended dynamically from multiple sources, and because Tableau Cloud is hosted in the cloud on AWS, Wolseley Canada achieved these successes without having to build and support new data center assets. Tableau takes care of software upgrades, plus server management and maintenance. \u201cOur people have greater visibility into the business than we had before,\u201d Danylo summed up. \u201cTableau Cloud has provided us with better analytics capabilities, and we can put them directly into the hands of non-technical users. Data at our fingertips helps everyone discover new insights so they can make data-driven business decisions and achieve more in their roles.\u201d"

Their mission is to innovate and inspire to improve riders' lives. They seek to enhance the cycling experience and get more people riding bicycles because they believe bikes have the power to change the world for the better. Based in California, Specialized has satellite headquarters in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Australia. Sales and finance teams at Specialized rely on data to guide their decisions, make accurate forecasts, and manage customer accounts. Until recently, analysts used Microsoft Excel to prepare reports for local personnel in sales and finance. \u201cAnalytics is decentralized here,\u201d explains analytics manager Dana Greenlaw. \u201cOur small, core team provides self-service resources so remote analysts can work independently to meet their local teams' needs.\u201d That kind of autonomy didn't effectively scale with static spreadsheets containing millions of rows of data. When Greenlaw and a coworker first discovered Tableau, they immediately saw its value. It delivered  dynamic, visual analytics that would empower coworkers and executives to dig deeper into their data and help analysts spend less time preparing reports and handling requests. Specialized first adopted Tableau Server to build a robust, new data warehouse to support dynamic reporting. But to scale the new capabilities to remote analysts meant overcoming a few challenges. Says Greenlaw, \u201cWe needed to reduce the burden on IT so we could make other upgrades more easily, like adding single sign-on and row-level security.\u201d Tableau Cloud (powered by AWS) was the best choice to support automatic upgrades and streamlined reporting. In one year, Specialized scaled Tableau from a handful of Creator and Explorer licenses to 80 total, adding multiple Viewers that all access analytics in the Tableau cloud. \u201cBy going to an online, cloud-based option, we no longer had to manage our Tableau infrastructure at all,\u201d says Greenlaw. \u201cAdoption was organic and fast because we could steer all remote teams toward Tableau as a common solution. With everyone on the same platform, even the way we deliver reports is scalable now.\u201d In addition to infrastructure savings, Tableau Cloud benefitted Specialized by returning valuable time to the analysts. Instead of taking a whole day to build and format a weekly report, many analysts can typically create one in under one hour. Tableau has quickly become a crowd favorite at Specialized, and many analysts openly talk about how much they enjoy working with the software. This ease of use has helped teams across the company to become more data-driven in their daily workflows. Beyond the sales and finance organizations, the \u201crider care\u201d warranty team and even IT has adopted Tableau Cloud. And as part of the continuing effort to engage cyclists and understand their needs, Specialized is now looking at new data toolsets to drive other business functions like project management, and to monitor IT and digital helpdesk performance. \u201cWe believe cycling changes lives,\u201d says Greenlaw. \u201cIf centralized access to data can help us reach more people and run our business more efficiently, that means we have the resources to help our customers get the most out of their purchases, while we' also find new ways to fulfill our mission.\u201d"

        "company": "Vanguard Charitable",
        "content": "Vanguard Charitable is a public 501(c)3 charity and one of the largest charitable grantmakers in the US, helping more than 20,000 donors become strategic philanthropists by leveraging a donor-advised fund (DAF). A DAF is an account for charitable giving designed exclusively to invest, grow, and give assets to charities for meaningful and lasting impact. Vanguard Charitable has granted more than $10 billion to charities since its foundation in 1997, and generated more than $4 billion in additional funds for charities through investments. \u201cOur mission is twofold,\u201d explained Vicky Kelberer, group manager of the 8-person Vanguard Charitable Research & Strategy team. \u201cWe're increasing charitable giving within our client community, and we're helping each client maximize the impact of their charitable dollars over time.\u201d  To accomplish this, the team persistently looks for opportunities to help donors overcome various challenges to charitable giving, and to target and optimize their investments in ways that are aligned with their unique philanthropic strategy. And it must all be done using methods that keep fees and costs as low as possible, in keeping with the overall Vanguard investment philosophy. Not surprisingly, data is at the center of this process. \u201cOur donors can't evaluate their strategies unless they have access to data and reporting,\u201d said Kelberer. Until a few years ago, her team produced more than 150 customized reports for donors and the organization, using a fully manual process of downloading the data, wrangling it into spreadsheets and other static formats, and then reformatting each report for readability. As Kelberer points out, \u201cIf the report isn't easy to look at and follow, the client is less likely to engage with it and gain any real insights or productivity.\u201d In 2018, the team piloted a program that used Tableau to shift from manual reporting to interactive analysis, using current data. Even with just a basic dashboard to start out, the pilot gained a great deal of traction. Our teams had faster access to changes, trends, and insights in the data, thanks to 30-minute refresh cycles. \u201cHaving fast, regular updates was groundbreaking for us,\u201d said Kelberer. \u201cEspecially during our annual giving season\u2014it spans November and December, but we never know in advance when the big donation volumes are going to hit. So, getting live updates every half-hour enables us to act in a much more nimble way.\u201d The new dashboards also help provide access and insights to all donors, who span a wide range of technical and financial know-how. \"The donors' varying levels of experience guides all of our web design requirements and visualizations,\" said Kelberer. The immediate access to numbers also increases the organization's public relations capabilities by enabling it to provide philanthropic giving data upon request from outside agencies and media. In the first year following the pilot, the volume of manual reports produced by Kelberer's team dropped to 50% of its previous number; this year, it got below 30%, and the goal for 2021 is zero\u2014all custom data reported to donors and shared across the internal groups will be analyzed and presented in Tableau. This not only lowers operational overhead by reducing cycle-time goals for data management, but also empowers Vanguard Charitable to communicate more proactively with donors about making grants. And where donor reporting once occupied one person's time for four full days each month, the remaining reports require only a three-hour monthly download. \u201cWe basically flipped the 80/20 ratio,\u201d Kelberer said. \u201cWe achieved that 'sweet spot' in analytics where instead of spending 80% of our time wrangling data, that's more like 20% now, and the remaining time we can spend actually analyzing what's going on.\u201d And it's all in service to the organization's dual mission of promoting contributions from philanthropically minded investors and maximizing each donation's effect. Kelberer is especially proud of the ways Tableau has helped unleash her team's creativity, finding new ways that data can help Vanguard Charitable donors increase their charitable impact. \u201cOften the simplest things can get in the way of making a decision to give money to charity,\u201d said Kelberer. \u201cUsing Tableau, our team can remove a lot of those barriers, and share information with our donors much faster and more clearly, showing them the best path to following through on their philanthropic strategy.\u201d Vanguard Charitable recently launched the Nonprofit Aid Visualizer (NAVi), a web-based mapping tool that helps donors locate charities in areas vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. By bringing together multiple datasets in a single interactive map visualization, NAVi enables donors to give to organizations making an impact in their local communities and across the US."

Founded in 1971 and headquartered in Switzerland, the Forum\u2019s purpose is to empower global leaders to shape the future for the better. The Forum is probably best known for its Annual Meeting in Davos, which has become the world\u2019s foremost summit for shaping global, regional, and industry agendas. The Forum was challenged to simplify the way people access data and derive insights. According to S\u00e9bastien Daniel, Head of Investment and Analytics, the Forum\u2019s growth meant that it was relying on more than 100 different dashboards, which made it difficult to see, understand, and interpret the insights residing in the data. \u201cAs the data analytics team, our mission is to support internal teams and our external stakeholders with their decision-making,\u201d S\u00e9bastien explains. \u201cHowever, the proliferation of dashboards meant insights were hidden.\u201d Salesforce is a Strategic Technology Partner of the Forum, so when S\u00e9bastien\u2019s team became aware of the Tableau acquisition, they were excited to use the platform. \u201cI was already a passionate fan of Tableau. We then tested Tableau and quickly realized it would be a massive improvement on the way we do analytics.\u201d \u2018As part of a nine-month program to streamline analytics (conducted during the pandemic lockdown) the team reduced the 100+ dashboards  to 25: a 75% reduction. This unified suite of visual dashboards is now used to monitor the key performance indicators (KPIs) against which the Forum manages its operations and measures its success. Data associated with everything from finance and planning to sales and partner relationships is analyzed using this one, shared view of data. \u201cThis single source of the truth frees up time to create value from the data,\u201d says S\u00e9bastien. \u201cFor example, Tableau gives us complete, near real-time insight into our 1,000 partner community, including their status, engagement, and the projects we\u2019re working on with them.\u201d The analytics platform will also support the 2022 World Economic Forum in Davos, collecting insights across the event journey of participants from registration to post-event-feedback.  \u201cThis will help us to balance attendance across over- and under-subscribed sessions. The events team were impressed when we showed them this capability,\u201d says S\u00e9bastien.  Tableau is also upending how the Forum presents data analytics and engages with key stakeholders. Every year, for example, the Forum publishes its Global Risks Report, which analyzes the risks facing business and society. Earlier this year, for the first time, the report included an interactive Tableau dashboard that maps the Global Risks Network for the upcoming year. The map can help companies see not only a headline risk, but all the downstream impacts of any one or a collective group of risk drivers. Leaders can see, for example, the degree to which longer term \u2018Failure on Climate Action\u2019 is seen as driving \u2018Human Environmental Damage\u2019. The integration of Tableau within Salesforce will continue to transform the speed to insight. One example is Uplink, the Forum\u2019s new, open-source digital platform to crowdsource participation from entrepreneurs, community groups, and others to meet the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. In time, the united power of Salesforce and Tableau will help to deliver impact at scale. S\u00e9bastien explains, \u201cThere are several exciting challenges running on Uplink right now. We have one which is trying to understand how to protect the biodiversity of the Amazon Forest. Another is looking at how to design a carbon market, and one that is trying to tackle plastic pollution.\u201d Integrating all this data and creating actionable insights could be slow and resource intensive. To overcome this, the Forum relies on MuleSoft to connect data sources, wherever they reside. \u201cMuleSoft uses reusable APIs to simplify our application and data integration. It means we don\u2019t need to replicate any of the data and the quality of the data we are analyzing is significantly better than it used to be,\u201d says S\u00e9bastien. For example, the Forum has been able to unlock key logistical data to support its high profile events, and share information with partners. MuleSoft is helping make information more consumable and reducing the risk of human error. This complete, unified ecosystem is complemented by Datorama, which provides the Forum with a connected view of all marketing activities and investments, so the Forum can act on the right insights at the right time to drive engagement. As data becomes increasingly woven into the Forum\u2019s operations and mindset, a data culture is steadily evolving. S\u00e9bastien again: \u201cMost of our effort so far has been put on training, communication, and identifying champions to spearhead adoption. We want everyone to be united behind a shared goal to ask questions, challenge ideas, and use data \u2013 not just intuition \u2013 to make decisions.\u201d"

        "content": "As the gateway between the East and the West, Dubai Airports is the world\u2019s busiest airport in terms of international passenger volume. Operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the airport - which includes both Dubai International (DXB) and Dubai World Central (DWC) airports - serves millions of customers each year. Ensuring clockwork precision of flights and operations for passengers and airlines is crucial to Dubai Airports\u2019 success and growth. Here, Mohammed Farhaz, Senior Manager of Aviation Business Analytics, shares how Tableau has helped the company identify profitable new revenue streams, maintain clockwork airport operations and manage the impact of COVID-19 as effectively as possible. Today\u2019s airport operations involve many different systems and services all working together. The more harmoniously they do this, the better the overall customer experience will be. Data and analytics play a central role in helping us understand and refine every aspect of these systems, from check-in queue times and shop locations to punctuality of flight arrivals and departures. It also helps us track evolving trends in the commercial aviation industry and identify new routes or destinations that customers would like served from our airports, enabling us to expand our network footprint and service offering. Prior to Tableau, a majority of our data processes lacked the potential to be automated, which meant we spent a significant amount of time repeating the same tasks on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. For instance, in order to provide senior management with the latest traffic data from around the airport, we had to manually input this information into Excel and rebuild the same report every week. It was also sometimes challenging to spot important insights buried within spreadsheets of flight/traffic data, meaning potential opportunities to improve our operations were being overlooked or missed altogether. Now, most of these old manual processes have been completely automated, saving hundreds of man-hours a month. Data is staged in SQL server databases, prepped in Alteryx and then connected directly to Tableau, where it can be refreshed at the click of a button. Once a new dashboard is built, it never needs to be manually updated or maintained again. Employees can access it whenever they want, making them self-reliant and enabling them to correctly answer their own questions and analytics needs for the first time. We have over 13 different teams using Tableau in this way, including: Finance, Capacity Planning, Operations, Engineering Services, Investment Planning and more.\nTableau\u2019s emphasis on visual analytics - particularly mapping - also makes key trends and patterns in the data significantly easier to see, such as new flight destinations that are quickly growing in popularity. Having that visual sense of markets makes complex analytics much easier to understand. Tableau is designed to make the most of geographical data, so you can get to the \u201cwhere\u201d as well as the \u201cwhy.\u201d Out-of-the-box geocoding and rich interactive maps make geospatial analysis available to everyone, without the need for specialised software. The core objective of the Business Development team is to bring new airlines and activity into the airport. Doing so requires building an effective business case that demonstrates passenger needs are going unmet. For example, we identified significant traffic flows of passengers who were flying indirectly to Dubai via other hubs. This insight helped us find and create new market opportunities for passengers who were previously unserved.\nFinding these insights used to take a huge amount of number crunching, but now we can explore the data via an automated Tableau dashboard, which is updated with ticketing information from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) database every month. We can easily explore the data on a global heatmap to see the latest trends. This approach gives us the evidence we need to create compelling airline proposals in a matter of hours, when previously it would take days of manual analytics work. Our airports operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, whereas many others have a certain offline or curfew period. As such, our scheduling needs to run smoothly round the clock. One of the biggest threats to this is bad weather, which can quickly cause major disruption. Fortunately, we can use Tableau to mitigate the worst effects. When the meteorology department issues a weather warning, we analyse our planned schedule for the affected period and identify airlines operating multiple flights to/from the same destination within this window. We then work with these airlines to proactively reschedule or cancel flights and consolidate the demand with fewer flights to minimize the impact of such disruption whilst maintaining connectivity and customer service standards. The last six months have been very challenging for the whole aviation industry, with travel and tourism hit particularly hard. Like many others, we\u2019ve focused on managing expenses as efficiently as possible, closing facilities where necessary to make OPEX savings and keep costs as low as possible. Tableau is helping us to closely monitor the market recovery and inform key decisions regarding the reopening of facilities as and when passenger confidence returns."

        "company": "Austrian Airlines",
        "content": "With every aspect of the aviation industry becoming increasingly digitised, rapid access to accurate data and analytics is more important than ever before. Headquartered in Vienna, Austrian Airlines AG, a subsidiary of the Lufthansa Group, is Austria\u2019s largest carrier, operating a global route network of approximately 130 destinations. Here, Christian Novosel, Head of Business Development, Digitisation and Fleet at Austrian Airlines and Lukas Rudari, Senior Manager Digital Delivery & Strategy, discuss how the company\u2019s new mobile analytics app uses Tableau to put powerful data insights directly into the hands of executives. Doing so enables them to make fast, data-driven decisions on the spot and identify invaluable operational savings during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We generate vast amounts of data every day which, with the help of the right systems, can be harnessed to improve our operational excellence across the board - from customer bookings to aircraft maintenance scheduling. Finding and unlocking the insights hidden in our data allows us to continually refine business processes and achieve clockwork operations at scale, which is key to long-term success in the modern aviation sector. Our executives are extremely busy, so data needs to be tailored to their specific requirements. When looking at any dashboard the \u2018so what\u2019 or key message needs to be immediately clear. Data also has to be highly accessible, even when out of the office or on the road. For this reason, we recently created a custom mobile analytics app. The app is designed to provide round-the-clock access to highly prioritised, highly curated Tableau dashboards and PDF reports, which contain all the latest data and KPIs our executives need to make fully informed business decisions from anywhere. We were already a highly data-driven organisation, but the introduction of mobile analytics has helped us take it a step further and achieve real cultural transformation at the highest level. Thanks to the app, executives have access to data and analytics wherever they go. This means they can pull up the latest operational information, compare year-over-year performance in key areas like punctuality, and even drill down into specific data points, all in just a few seconds. As a result, they can use data as a key part of the day-to-day decision making process, rather than relying on gut feel most of the time. The simple tile-based interface also makes it really easy to use. Each tile represents a different dashboard and tiles can be removed or quickly added whenever necessary, meaning the app always contains the most relevant information at any given time. Dashboards can also be \u2018favorited\u2019 and re-arranged by individual users based on personal importance, so they are immediately visible when the app is opened. In such a volatile environment, this level of data agility has proved absolutely invaluable. Initially launched at Austrian Airlines as \u201cCrisis Management App\u201d, the app has now been rolled out for top management at Austrian and the broader Lufthansa Group where it is used for various reporting purposes. It goes without saying that the aviation industry has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. When lockdown measures were first announced, we received tens of thousands of booking cancellation requests in just a few days, so our call centres were working day and night to try and process them all as quickly as possible. In order to keep executives updated, we created a new Tableau dashboard that provided detailed data on the total number of incoming cancellation requests and refunds processed, and we put it straight in the app. This immediately gave our executives access to the latest figures - updated hourly - which could be used to inform decisions, as well as respond to the huge number of press enquiries coming in. We\u2019ve also had to lower our operational costs as much as possible during this period, so have reduced working hours for our staff. However, we\u2019ve still needed key sections of our workforce, such as call centers, flight crews, engineering and legal, to keep things moving at different points in time. Using the app, executives can accurately track all of these resourcing needs and clearly see how staffing levels are stacking up against productivity throughout the business. This high level of visibility has made discussions much more data driven and helped the leadership team pinpoint the exact moment when bringing staff back from reduced working hours will have the biggest impact. Lufthansa is under a high level of scrutiny at the moment. Our flights form a key part of the DACH region\u2019s infrastructure, which is incredibly important for the transportation of medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as the repatriation of citizens from affected countries. Using Tableau and our mobile app, we can visualise and share critical logistical information quickly and efficiently, ensuring everyone has the data they need to make fast, informed decisions whenever required. Make sure you produce tangible outcomes - like an app - and that the data can be easily understood by the respective target audience. Don\u2019t waste too much time trying to perfect everything before making it available either. It\u2019s often better to get a starting point out there as soon as you can, which can be refined later using input from users. Finally, be relevant. Be where the question is, not behind the curve. Use lighthouse projects that decision makers can see and use, which will help get them more invested in data as a whole. Then, once you\u2019ve made a case, ask for additional resources needed to transform your company into a more data driven organization."

        "content": "Turning on a tap to fill a kettle with water is a simple task - and one we take for granted. But supplying clean water to our homes and workplaces is anything but simple. United Utilities rises to this challenge every single day. Thanks to a complex network of pipes, sewers, reservoirs and pumps, it provides water and wastewater services to around seven million people across the North West of England. Here, Tim Stanley, Head of Data and Analytics at United Utilities, explains how Tableau empowers more than 2,000 employees to make smarter decisions and drive better outcomes. From energy consumption to reservoir capacity, Tim discusses the impact of richer analytics on safeguarding water supplies and boosting performance. It\u2019s pivotal. Our operations are highly regulated, which means we have to report on our performance to lots of different stakeholders - and be able to demonstrate the data behind every single metric. We also want to help our teams make smarter decisions by extracting more value from our data - whether it involves rainfall levels or customer service response times. To support our data science ambitions, we needed a business intelligence solution that could work across multiple systems and data formats. With Tableau, we can aggregate and visualise the analysis of billions of rows of data from more than 30 sources, including AI sensors on our pipes and mobile apps used by our field workers. In the past, people created their own version of the truth using different data sources. With Tableau, everyone can now access the same joined-up story. Around 2,000 employees use Tableau - it\u2019s become critical for accessing insights into our business. We\u2019ve let our citizen data scientists come up with their own analytics and visualisations. For example, one of the team created a daily dashboard recently for tracking reservoir levels, which includes weather forecasts and water consumption data. This helps us manage potential water use increases and possible shortages during hot weather. To make sure we are generating the most relevant analytics for the right teams, we monitor the volume of traffic to different Tableau dashboards. It\u2019s a bit like a TV ratings systems! The customer service analytics are really popular and receive a couple of thousand hits per day. It\u2019s not just about improving performance, it\u2019s about boosting efficiency. We want to save \u00a3110 million by 2025 while also reducing customers\u2019 bills. To achieve this, we need to find ways to use our resources more effectively. With Tableau, we can save both time and money. For example, we now have a daily view of energy utilisation across all our field sites and power sources, which has helped us decrease our energy consumption by up to 15% at target sites and reduce overall costs by more than \u00a3850,000 per annum. By visualising the time spent on operational activities, we\u2019ve also been able to better understand the work of our field teams, resulting in a 50% improvement in unallocated schedule time. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had this level of visibility of team activities. By optimising how we use our resources, we can provide a faster response to major incidents. Our consumption of water changed drastically during 2020 as fewer people were commuting to work or taking holidays. This intensified during the summer months, which put additional demand on both our water and wastewater services. We don\u2019t want to just improve outcomes for our current customers; we want to safeguard water supply for future generations. And that means we need to better understand supply and demand. With Tableau, we can analyse changes in consumption and predict if we have sufficient resources to meet demand. We have already unlocked a lot of insight - especially through the integration with Salesforce, which is used by our field workers and contact centre agents. We want to explore this link further by tracking customer support trends, which will help us accelerate our response times and identify issues on the water and wastewater networks earlier."

        "company": "ABN AMRO Clearing",
        "content": "Speed. High volume transactions. Security and compliance. These are the key challenges faced by clearing banks around the world. Consistently ranked amongst the top three clearers in every time zone, ABN AMRO Clearing processes more than 16 million trades per day and up to 46 million trades on peak days, across 90 of the world\u2019s leading exchanges. With 10 offices globally, and over 800 employees, the company is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of clearing and financing services for listed derivatives and cash securities. ABN AMRO Clearing wanted secure access to accurate data in order to monitor the settlement process with the clarity and confidence that contributes to safe, transparent global markets. Here, the bank reveals how analysing counterparty risk in real-time with Tableau has improved speed, agility, and reduced risk - even when recent settlement demand grew to three times more than the daily average, due to market volatility. Counterparty settlement risk \u2013 the risk that one of the participants may fail to meet their settlement obligations on a trade \u2013 is inherent to the bank\u2019s business and requires close oversight. \u201cFor ABN AMRO Clearing it is essential to monitor our settlement risk in real-time,\u201d says Monique Verhoef, Chief Operations Officer in Europe. \u201cOur aim is to make sure huge volumes of transactions all settle in time, on the intended settlement date. Late settlements can have a negative impact on our liquidity forecasts, particularly in busy markets. We aim to reduce our overall exposure on counterparties, and to contribute to the efficient functioning of financial markets as a whole.\u201d Previously, this liquidity verification for failed settlements was labour intensive and time consuming. Fragmented datasets from different source systems made it difficult to make well-informed decisions and act accordingly. Now, using Tableau, teams across the bank can explore their data securely, and act on the insights gained with speed and clarity. Trusted, real-time data is at the heart of every decision. When a settlement instruction enters the system, employees can follow it through to settlement, visually tracking and analysing every feature - from transaction type and fees, to the originating market. On occasion, when manual intervention is needed, Tableau provides fast, informed insight into the issue so employees can take action to resolve it proactively. \u201cEfficient monitoring through Tableau allows reliable protection of our liquidity position, which is most important when markets are under stress,\u201d says Roos Janssen, Head of Client Operations. \u201cIn the blink of an eye we spot bottlenecks in the settlement process and can focus on proactively monitoring unmatched, unsettled transactions in our clients\u2019 accounts, to support our clients when they need it the most.\u201d According to Rowan Preesman, Product Owner Data Analytics, this agility has significantly improved the timely settlement rate. \u201cIn the past, we spent hours analysing data downloads to locate large problematic settlements, which was very time consuming and not always accurate. Using Tableau, real-time dashboards allow us to instantly identify unmatched and failed settlements. This pace plays a vital role in reducing counterparty risk and improving the client experience.\u201d Using Tableau allowed ABN AMRO Clearing to act quickly and decisively during the Covid-19 pandemic, when market volatility contributed to unprecedented settlement activity. March 2020 was the busiest month ever for ABN AMRO Clearing, with more trades processed that month than in an average quarter in 2019. The peak day volume was approximately 46 million trades per day, processed in our core systems, generating more than 40,000 settlements per day \u2013 more than double the busiest day up to that date. With Tableau\u2019s help, ABN AMRO Clearing rose to the challenge. Roos explains. \u201cIn such a stretched situation, it is of paramount importance to have instant availability to accurate, real-time information. As a clearing firm, we guarantee our clients\u2019 trades towards the financial infrastructure. Tableau allows us to manage settlement risk seamlessly even in stressed markets, and a lot more efficiently than before\u201d."

        "content": "Criteo S.A. is a leading online advertising service provider, headquartered in Paris, France. Founded in 2005, the company specialises in personalised web communications, has 2,740 employees and revenues of approximately \u20ac2.08 billion. Tableau helps Criteo make sense of vast petabytes of advertising and commerce data. Insights that previously took up to 46 hours to find in Excel are now available in as little as six seconds. By democratising data, employees are more self-sufficient and free to explore their own ideas and innovations in a secure, governed environment. Tableau is scaling globally with ease, creating a data culture based on trusted data, collaboration and shared learning experiences. Previously, Criteo was relying on Excel to perform a large majority of its online advertising data analysis. However, this quickly reached its limit when analysing data sourced from thousands of extensive server logs. \u201cWe experienced some serious data challenges before Tableau,\u201d recalls Fran\u00e7ois Jehl, Engineering Manager at Criteo. \u201cWe had no data lake. In fact, no data warehouse of any kind. Our first task was to consolidate data into one unified system. Our next step was to deploy Tableau. This was a logical continuation of our data-centric strategy, since Tableau enables Criteo to leverage its gigantic petabyte-wide data rows.\u201d Criteo now has thousands of employees diving into Tableau to interact with and ask questions of their data. \u201cNobody wants to analyse data within Excel \u2013 it\u2019s too slow, complicated and open to error,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois. \u201cTableau is simply the best tool for the job.\u201d According to Fran\u00e7ois, the power of Tableau really stood out in one key moment. He explains, \u201cEvery day, our Sales Directors needed a particular report, created using an outmoded analytics solution. My task was to increase the time-out on the server as it took almost 46 hours to render this vast report. Using Tableau, that all changed. I was able to run the report in six seconds. That was a big win moment.\u201d \u201cTableau is now used by everyone in the local Criteo offices,\u201d explains Fran\u00e7ois. \u201cWhen a client contacts us with an enquiry, for example, asking how a particular campaign is performing, the investigation takes place in Tableau. Tableau has become the most important tool within the sales and operations function. It has been here for a while and there\u2019s no other tool that can do even 50% of the job.\u201d Criteo deals with such large databases, it is critical for Tableau to grow seamlessly with the changing needs of the business. \u201cScalability is insanely important,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, we have no concerns regarding the scalability of Tableau; it adapts to whatever size and scale we need.\u201d Developing data-skills amongst employees means everyone can anaylse their data in Tableau. \u201cWe did a mix of internal training and we contracted with some companies,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois. \u201cAt some point we even hired the head of the Tableau User Group France. He\u2019s still here after five years!\u201d Tableau is democratising data at Criteo. \u201cWe need people to be independent and free to explore their own ideas and innovations,\u201d explains Fran\u00e7ois. \u201cTableau delivers this curiosity on every level. Our people can use visual analytics to remove the noise, find critical insights, and make better decisions.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois continues, \u201cIf you take the last presentation made by a member of staff \u2013 any presentation, in fact \u2013 Tableau is at the heart of the story. It might be someone analysing an IT server purchase, an individual in our US office examining Web traffic or an executive exploring a finance question. Every minute of every day, Tableau is changing the way our people look at their data.\u201d The data-centric culture is spreading quickly and widely. Across the organisation, there is trust in data that didn\u2019t exist before, and a sense that data is a strategic asset and the gateway to fast, informed decision-making. Criteo now has an internal Tableau community which supports experience-sharing and skills development among employees. Fran\u00e7ois explains, \u201cWe have people internally building a Tableau community, sharing best practice, sending out newsletters with tips of the week and generally communicating a sense that Criteo\u2019s future success lies in its data.\u201d Tableau has even become a centre-piece of Criteo\u2019s everyday language. \u201cWe hear people now saying, \u2018Give me a Tableau for that\u2019!\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois."

Here, Ross Watkins, People Analytics & Reporting Manager at EDF, discusses how the company has used Tableau to harness the power of data across its human resources (HR) operations. Ross shares how they turned this information into a strategic asset that employees can use to make more informed, data-driven decisions, every day. What role does data play at EDF? Data has always played a major role at EDF - and, as the emphasis on digitisation has increased over time, it\u2019s become more important than ever. However, just a few years ago, we were almost paralysed by it. Huge amounts of data were being collected across the business, but we didn\u2019t have the right tools in place to derive real value from it. We knew we needed a new analytics solution that could unlock this value and make it more accessible on a day-to-day basis. We also needed to change the mindset of employees towards data as a whole, helping them to see it as a strategic asset rather than something to be scared of. What HR data challenges were you facing before Tableau? Every month, my team had to manually create over 900 HR reports for users across the business, containing information on key areas such as open job positions, new recruits and staff absences. Each report was compiled in Excel using data pulled from SAP and then distributed to the person requesting it via email. This time-consuming process was nearly a full-time job for six out of the eight members within the team. What is more, these reports contained very little in the way of analytical insights. There were no summaries or commentary about the data itself, many reports even contained the exact same data set, just with an additional column or filter added, depending on the specific needs of the recipient. We were essentially little more than a report factory. How did Tableau help solve these challenges? Migrating to Tableau allowed us to replace the 900 manual reports with 13 central Tableau dashboards, each of which offers insights into a key area of HR operations. This was an iterative process, but once we saw Tableau, we knew our end goal. The dashboards can be accessed and analysed by relevant users whenever they want, significantly reducing the ongoing reporting burden. As a result, my team now has the capacity to conduct more strategic relational analysis that challenges the status quo and helps optimise data and information flow across the business. Tableau\u2019s accessibility and ease of use has also enabled many more employees to start self-serving their own analytics needs, contributing to an additional 50 percent drop in ad-hoc reporting requests. Using Tableau, HR Business Partners can explore hypotheses and answer questions on the spot during meetings, rather than taking questions away and referring them back to us, which takes considerably longer. This means they can react much faster to key trends and insights that are uncovered, greatly improving overall operational efficiency. With more people now accessing and analysing data across the business, effective governance has become crucial. Thankfully, Tableau\u2019s extensive security features give us full control over who is accessing every data set, ensuring we meet our compliance and data protection obligations at all times. What are the next steps on your data journey? We currently have several Tableau Server deployments across EDF and plan to consolidate them into our central HR deployment soon. Not only will this break down any remaining data silos in areas such as finance and marketing, it will make cross-referencing data much faster and easier than ever before. Do you have any advice for other companies trying to foster a more data-driven culture? Make sure you give people the means and motivation to work on data in their own terms. Tableau has been an enabler in this sense, sparking an initial interest that quickly takes on a life of its own when people realise just how much it can help them in their day-to-day decision making."

NYC H+H was on the front line for one of the earliest and most severe surges in the COVID-19 global pandemic. To prepare for the surge, the health system activated its systemwide emergency response, and assembled a \u201ctiger team\u201d of operations and logistics personnel, medical and technical specialists, and hospital leadership, including the CEO. To support this team's daily meetings and throughout their roles, NYC H+H rapidly built a series of visualizations, starting with an emergency management landing page that showed up-to-the-minute graphs and tables of COVID-19 response information, from COVID admitted daily census numbers to ICU surge levels. This central landing page served as a hub for emergency response information by linking to multiple other dashboards, including a Patient Explorer that enabled users to ask questions and find answers about all COVID patients that had been admitted, such as demographic distribution, diagnosis history, ICU admittance and readmittance statuses, and trends in hospital admission dates and lengths of stay. Given the sensitivity of the data, access was limited to those who needed it for their COVID-19-related job functions. Other helpful dashboards included the Testing dashboard for seeing facility- and department-level data about the volume of confirmed, suspected, and negative COVID-19 cases, and the Beds dashboard, which provided invaluable insight into bed capacity and staffing levels at the height of the pandemic. Together, these dashboards helped NYC H+H make fast, informed, lifesaving decisions during a critical time by using data to guide leadership meetings and daily briefings. \u201cWe think of it as 'epidemic intelligence',\u201d said Jenny Smolen, Tableau Manager at the NYC H+H Office of Population Health. \u201cBringing together on-the-ground operational information with high-quality data streams and clinical expertise through our Tableau dashboards enabled our care teams and administrators to take precise action in real time.\u201d Many end users of the new platform agreed with this assessment. \u201cThe collaboration with our Population Health team and facility leadership was one of our greatest achievements during the COVID-19 surge,\u201d said Gabe Cohen, NYC H+H Bellevue Associate Hospital Epidemiologist and Infectious Disease Physician. \u201cWe shared data broadly that was easy to interpret. Using the dashboards, our front line clinicians communicated their needs and the Population Health team translated this with incredible speed into flexible, usable, and meaningful metrics.

        "company": "Experian",
        "content": "Experian is the world's leading global information services company, with operations in 37 countries around the world. Originally founded in 1996, it employs over 17,000 staff and generates annual revenues in excess of $5 billion (FY2020). Here, Sarah Robertson, Product Director at Experian, discusses Tableau\u2019s pivotal role in the company\u2019s new Experian Safeguard dashboard, a powerful analytics tool that helps public organisations use demographic data to pinpoint and protect vulnerable communities from COVID-19. What is Experian Safeguard? Experian Safeguard combines open-source data with Experian\u2019s own proprietary ConsumerView data files and presents it at the local authority level via a fully customisable Tableau dashboard. The tool is free to use for public organisations and gives them fast access to key insights about their local communities. This could help, for example, to pinpoint areas where there\u2019s a high concentration of people over 70 and/or living alone, as well as those with low household incomes. By analysing where these different factors converge, organisations can quickly identify vulnerable areas that likely require extra care and support. Why did you choose Tableau for this project? Thanks to our existing relationship with Tableau in both the UK and US, where Tableau forms part of our Ascend Analytical Sandbox, we knew that Tableau's deep analytics and high-quality visualisation capabilities made it a great fit for the project. Firstly, we wanted Experian Safeguard to be accessible to a wide range of organisations, which meant a Tableau Server solution worked extremely well. Secondly, we wanted it to be easy to pick up and use without the need for training and Tableau\u2019s intuitive user interface allows people to do exactly that. Finally, we wanted it to be fully scalable, which we could achieve very easily by deploying Tableau in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. Another key factor was speed to market. Unlike many products and solutions, which go through multiple concepts and test stages, we wanted to make Experian Safeguard available as quickly as possible, so we needed to use tools that allowed us to do that. Tableau\u2019s ease of use, combined with a wealth of pre-existing internal development knowledge, meant we were able to take Experian Safeguard from concept to deployment in just two weeks. How many organisations are using the dashboard at present? We currently have around 70 public organisations using it to identify and care for at-risk members of their communities. The dashboard is free to use on a \u2018data for good\u2019 basis, meaning it\u2019s not open to commercial users like supermarkets, but is widely available to local authorities, NHS Trusts, emergency services and charities. One example is the Trussell Trust, which is using Tableau heat maps to help establish the best locations for new food banks, and where they will reach the highest number of people. How important do you think data has been during the COVID-19 pandemic? As a data person, it\u2019s been incredibly interesting to see how the UK government has used it to effectively communicate with the population as a whole. Dashboards and visualisations showing demographics overlaid with COVID cases and deaths have played an increasingly central role in keeping the public informed as the pandemic evolves. Data will likely be even more important in the aftermath, as we try to gain a better understanding of what happened and how we can avoid something similar in future. Many people are already saying that data is the new gold or the new oil, and this will only be more true as time goes by. What are your future plans for Tableau within Experian UK? We already use Tableau for client deliveries and are always looking to extend our use of technology to deliver the best for our clients. Data visualisation and storytelling go hand in hand, helping people to spot trends quickly and understand what they mean. As such, the use of powerful visualisation technologies like Tableau will undoubtedly play a big role in our future."

        "content": "ZALORA is a leading online fashion destination where millions of customers across Asia can shop the more than 3,000 local brands. The \"data first, then fashion\" company relies heavily on Tableau dashboards and analytics to inform decisions about everything from marketing to merchandising and operations. Zalora also uses Tableau within Trender, an embedded analytics solution which reveals insights on consumer preferences and behavior. Trender is designed for use by Zalora's brand partners and was released just in time to help them navigate COVID-19 by making data-driven decisions about how they market and merchandise products. The value of Trender stems from Zalora's massive repository of trade data, including transaction data across six different markets. Combined with Tableau's visual analytics, this data reveals essential trends in customer behavior, like which age groups and regions are shopping most and which product categories are most popular. Brands can use this information to shape their retail strategies for online and in-store. Specifically, marketers can obtain an in-depth understanding of consumer segments and purchasing behavior to streamline their efforts on targeting the right audience, while designers can gain insights into trending colors, materials, and styles to work into the next season's collection. They can also drill down into sales across different markets as they evaluate where to open stores next based on the density of potential shoppers. Trender was created in just six months, with Zalora's in-house fashion experts, marketers and data analysts leveraging Tableau's embedded analytics platform. The solution was launched quicker to support brands through COVID-19, but over time will evolve to support analysis across a more diverse range of metrics. This will help Zalora seek to provide brand partners with constructive feedback and insight derived from our data. They can then leverage on the insights shared to re-look and re-calibrate their brand strategy. Vasudha Sarda, Senior Business Intelligence Analyst at Zalora, shared that the early users of Trender have appreciated the simplicity with which they can filter data and visualise trends at a micro-level. \"As a global brand we have so far found it difficult to get customer demographic or browsing data for the South East Asia market but with Trender will help us understand and react to demand on a real time basis\" was feedback from one of the brand-partners. The launch of Trender reflects Zalora's focus on using data to shape strategy. The company has been using Tableau for nearly four years and now has more than 500 users across multiple departments. They use live dashboards to monitor everything from activity in service centers through to the performance of campaigns. This real-time data is especially valuable in managing events like Singles Day, which is the biggest shopping holiday in the world. Zalora now plans to build on this data culture and create a roadmap for best practice which can be used internally and by customers. \"As an e-commerce company, our success lies in data analytics capability and agility to respond to the fast-changing consumer demands and the pandemic has brought to light this need,\" said Sarda. \"We now want to help build that same data culture across brands and work together to increase data maturity.\""

        "content": "Jakarta Smart City is a local government initiative dedicated to optimizing the use of technology to solve complex challenges such as pollution as well as emerging concerns like COVID-19. Data is key to tackling these issues and that\u2019s why Jakarta Smart City has a Data & Analytics division whose role is to help the government make better decisions, faster. In its early days of operation, much of Jakarta Smart City\u2019s data was analyzed in spreadsheets, with charts and graphs copied and pasted into presentations. The Data & Analytics division moved to Tableau four years ago to get insights faster and present them in a more engaging way. The division now has 50 active Tableau users and they are able to create dashboards in days instead of the weeks it took previously. This represents a time savings of up to 70%. More importantly, Jakarta Smart City and other government agencies are able to formulate policies based on data. Through the use of Tableau, the Data & Analytics division has also been able to support government agencies with understanding and managing risk related to COVID-19. Jakarta Smart City\u2019s Data & Analytics division has worked with government agencies to establish 60 visualizations that help address issues like pollution, traffic, and flooding. In the case of pollution and traffic, these issues are closely linked and the division first used Tableau to understand the extent of pollution based on information collected from sensors placed around Jakarta. This data ultimately helped inform a policy that limits the number of vehicles permitted to travel into the city each day. Known as the \u2018odd-even\u2019 policy, it restricts certain roads to vehicles on certain days based on the last digit of their registration plate. The policy is intended to encourage public transport and the city continues to monitor its effectiveness by analyzing whether there are increases in public transport use or whether traffic jams are forming in new areas. This data will help to refine the policy as needed and make any necessary adjustments to public transport. To address flooding in the city, the Data & Analytics team has set up Tableau dashboards for real-time monitoring of river and sea levels. If the water reaches a certain point, it triggers an alert that initiates a quick response from the government. Also, by analyzing and visualizing the water levels over time, the city can better understand why and when the flooding occurs and take action to manage risk. Juan Kanggrawan, Head of Data Analytics at Jakarta Smart City, said that in addition to helping solve these and other challenges, Tableau had helped to foster a healthy culture of open data sharing. This is evident not only internally but through Jakarta\u2019s open data project which provides public access to 40 visualizations. Building on is data culture, the government is using analytics to understand and manage the risk of COVID-19. The Data & Analytics division has developed Tableau visualizations to show the pattern of cases in different regions so that the government can understand the spread and prioritize its response. For example, the data can help them to see where doctors and nurses are needed and inform decisions about what social assistance may be required in different regions The division has also created a public dashboard that provides an overview of confirmed cases in Jakarta and across Indonesia. This dashboard has been viewed by more than 2.8 million people as everyone seeks to understand the impacts and risk. \u201cBy closely monitoring the situation and modeling the impacts, we can make better decisions like how long we need to limit our social interactions and when children should go back to school,\u201d said Kanggrawan. \u201cThis will help us prepare for the new normal and a progressive reopening.\u201d"

Seeing an opportunity to help the hospitality industry at a critical time, the company developed PurpleCloud Covid Response (CR), a slimmed-down version of their platform specially focused on new and enhanced requirements resulting from the pandemic. PurpleCloud CR helps hotels complete sanitation checklists using Ecolab and CDC guidelines, facilitate contact tracing, track training progress, and safely coordinate staffing to minimize face-to-face interactions. Using Tableau dashboards in the CR solution, hotel managers and executives can quickly check key COVID-related compliance metrics to ensure they're creating a safe space for guests and employees. Many PurpleCloud customers, including large hotel chains, are using older software that doesn't have visualization capabilities. Joe Durson, Chief Technology Officer at PurpleCloud, shared that \u201cTableau has built-in features that let us create dashboards where non-technical people can easily monitor the status of their hotel and use data to ensure they maintain safe operating standards.\u201d Knowing that nearly all hotels are experiencing drastic declines in revenue during the pandemic, the company currently makes the PurpleCloud CR platform available to their customers free of charge."

The agency's mission is to expand democracy and free markets while improving the lives of individuals in undeveloped and crisis-ridden parts of the world. Within USAID, the Bureau for Global Health allocates over $5 billion annually to support programs that combat infectious diseases, help prevent child and maternal deaths, and control the spread of HIV/AIDS. USAID Global Health wanted a more effective way of aggregating and disseminating the program data it had been collecting from health systems worldwide for over 60 years, in areas such as food security, child health, and pandemic threats. Due to unique data collection challenges in each of the 80 countries it served, the bureau struggled in its mission to empower front-line workers to improve health systems and outcomes through data-driven decision making and analysis. Not enough of the data was reaching the people who needed it, and when it did, the scattered nature of how it was collected resulted in a low level of trust of the data sets. USAID Global Health needed a way to collect more data and use it to its fullest potential. By engaging local communities, among other strategies, USAID Global Health has steadily improved its data collection practices. Using Tableau, they built the Global Health Data Analytics Hub, which enables workers throughout the agency to visualize recently collected data and use those insights for the decisions they need to make. The bureau also created the enterprise-wide Data Fellowship program, which uses data from Tableau dashboards to drive shared global health initiatives like the Joint External Evaluation (JEE). The JEE dashboard at USAID Global Health assesses and scores individual countries' capacity to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to public health risks. Using these visualizations, the Data Fellowship can recommend agency actions in coordination with other nations and groups. When it came to securing executive commitment for new data-driven resources across the agency, USAID Global Health developed hundreds of new Tableau self-service dashboards and other applications to present data in new and useful ways. To promote adoption, the bureau has pursued a data education program that helps users at all levels of technical ability achieve more in their roles and have a larger impact. In less than two years, USAID Global Health has transformed from a data-siloed organization with limited data\u2014and only a few expert users who used it\u2014to an enterprise-deployed Tableau environment easily accessible to all levels of users, meeting 90% or more of their data needs. Storytelling, which used to be largely anecdotal based on field observations, is now based on solid reporting and benchmark discussions driven by high-quality, trustworthy data that's plain for all to see. In this new culture, data is a catalyst not only for organizational improvement but also for achieving positive outcomes in individuals' lives. \u201cTableau lets us provide data and insights to the people who need it most,\u201d shared Leeza Kondos, USAID Senior Data Scientist. \u201cThe better data we have, the better analytics we can perform, and the better outcomes we're able to show. The data gives us better evidence and supports better discussions with the people who implement our programs. Ultimately, it helps to produce better health outcomes, which is our goal.\u201d"

This commitment is strongly seen as Bank Mandiri implements a culture of data optimization, where each decision of every department will be made using data analytics. The bank\u2019s partnership with Tableau supports this by helping to improve data analytics skills among employees and by making data more accessible. The partnership has so far proved beneficial as Bank Mandiri\u2018s Enterprise Data Management (EDM) Group, collaborates with Tableau to lead the development of the bank\u2019s analytics capability. This group has successfully accelerated the dissemination of information from two weeks to two days in some cases and is defining new standards for data quality, governance, and accessibility. In the past, information requests were sent to headquarters which needed two weeks to run an SQL query and gather information from different systems. They then prepared a report in spreadsheet format and sent this out by email. Bank Mandiri, however, wanted a faster and easier way to analyse information and to provide more secure access to those who need it. The EDM Group is helping to deliver this and is now able to provide requested information in a more timely manner. What\u2019s more, the information provided is not just a plain and as requested report but comes with thorough and up to date insights to helps make better and faster decisions. The bank is strictly supervised by the financial regulators to guarantee customer\u2019s\u2019 information privacy and this privacy is always prioritized and protected. The partnership with Tableau contributes to privacy by creating data governance. To support this, the bank is also planning to launch a new data governance unit as well as a data committee. The EDM Group has worked with Tableau to develop more than 600 dashboards and visualizations. One of these is a dashboard for monitoring debtors daily transactions, as well as supporting better decision making on new and renewal loan disbursement. Another dashboard is used to show customer behaviour and transaction characteristics, helping the bank to make analysis on the success of marketing campaigns and to determine the best strategy for future ones. A third dashboard is used to provide descriptive analytics to inform cross selling recommendations. The EDM Group has also increased the speed of responding to ad hoc requests and is able to provide various groups with secure access to visualizations in Tableau rather than sending data out in spreadsheets. The group is now expanding on these projects with an increased focus on embedding its data to all groups of the bank, including Distribution Strategy which supervises branch networks across the country. \u201cEvery decision we take must be based on data, whether those decisions are made at a C-level or within a branch. It is also important that everyone has access to the same data so that there will be no dispute about the facts. This is what we are currently working on,\u201d Setiawan added. Within the EDM group, there are at least four roles required for data and analytics: a data engineer, a data governance officer, a business analyst, and a data scientist. There are development plans for each role and they will have access to the curriculum from Mandiri University. As this team grows, they will lead user groups and empower others across the bank to become more data-driven. As an example, the EDM Group has started to enable non- EDM users with data analytics capability by organizing Data & Analytics Course Programs. The programs have been running since January 2020 and include participants from various divisions who can gain fundamental knowledge about data and learn how to produce visual analytics by using Tableau. To engage the participants, the EDM Group has created a community called Mandiri Tableau User Group (MTUG) which meets monthly and also provides coaching for Tableau users who have problems with data, analytics, and visualization. The coaches are volunteers from the EDM Group who can show their colleagues how to prepare future analysis and visualization reports. Angga Pratama from Consumer Credit Risk and Analytics is one of the 571 employees using Tableau and said, \u201cBy creating good visualizations through Tableau, management can easily produce good analysis as well, helping the bank to make better decisions.\u201d"

        "company": "Castor EDC",
        "content": "Castor is passionate about transforming medical research. Thousands of medical device, biotech, and academic researchers around the world rely on the Castor electronic data capture (EDC) platform to easily integrate high-quality data from any source and accelerate their studies. Here, Castor\u2019s CEO and Founder, Derk Arts discusses how visual analytics with Tableau \u2013 as part of the Castor EDC platform \u2013 is being used to better understand the Covid-19 virus, optimise valuable hospital resources, and ultimately improve COVID-19 patient outcomes. How is Castor\u2019s technology supporting the fight against COVID-19?\nPrior to launching Castor, it was clear to me that medical research and evidence-based medicine wasn\u2019t making the most of data. Too often, decisions still relied on paper content, spreadsheets, or free text publishing. I set out to address that. At Castor, we see a future where all medical research data is machine readable, reusable, and available to all to improve patient outcomes. When novel strains of viruses like the Coronavirus emerge, data is clearly our most valuable asset. This was true during the Ebola outbreak, where we already had decades of research into the effects and possible treatments, and it is doubly true in the case of Coronavirus. Castor\u2019s research EDC platform is available for free for all COVID-19 research projects. We are now supporting more than 200 COVID-19 studies across 16 countries. And because time is of the essence, we enabled these studies to go live within six days on average. We developed pre-built electronic case report forms (eCRFs) based on World Health Organisation (WHO) standards, to help researchers start their study or registry in less than an hour. How does Tableau fit into this COVID-19 research?\nOne of the best ways to maximise the impact of data is through visual analytics. And nobody does that better than Tableau. Tableau was the first choice to underpin our Covid-19 program. It\u2019s simple to use and incredibly powerful, and empowers people to understand research results considerably faster and more efficiently. Could you share an example of COVID-19 research and how Tableau is being used?\nCastor has made its EDC platform available for free to any non-profit research associated with Covid-19. And Tableau is an integral part of that. This is especially true in the case of the COVID-19 Predict study, a collaboration between doctors and researchers in the Netherlands to better understand and predict which COVID-19 patients should receive which treatment and which type of care. We\u2019re ensuring the optimal allocation of limited hospital resources and making certain the most grievously ill patients receive the highest level of care. Our EDC system is helping the Covid Predict consortium to easily capture data from multiple sources \u2013 it currently comprises more than five million data points. Algorithms for predicting disease outcomes are being created and tested with data that is retrieved in real-time through Castor\u2019s API, which enables integration with a wide range of other platforms. These algorithms assist in predicting the probability that a patient will require intensive care, and if so, what the likely outcome will be. Tableau enables people to understand all this quickly and easily. It provides an overview of admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), medium care unit, and hospital wards, as well as visualising patient outcomes and complications. One crucial dashboard, for example, shows the demographic age profile of admissions, the average admission duration, and the number of individuals either discharged from hospital, hospitalised, transferred, receiving palliative care, or who have sadly passed away. This is remarkable and valuable work. What role has Tableau partner The Information Lab Netherlands played in supporting these projects?\nAll of this is made possible through the trusted partnership with Tableau, the expertise of The Information Lab, and Alteryx. In just a few days, for instance, The Information Lab created these incredibly powerful visualisations which are ultimately helping to reduce hospital crowding, protect staff, and prioritise patients that need to be hospitalised. How important is it that healthcare providers become more data-driven?\nEveryone needs to come together with a shared mission to see data as a trusted asset. Once data flows freely between researchers, clinicians and others, for example, it becomes possible to shrink research cycles and improve healthcare outcomes. Data is also everyone\u2019s responsibility. We all need to be committed to using data to make better decisions."

        "company": "CellRebel",
        "content": "CellRebel was founded with the vision to enable mobile operators and consultancy service providers to better understand and improve the mobile subscriber experience. By embedding Tableau\u2019s interactive, analytical capabilities directly into its secure, personalised portal, the Swedish organisation is helping operators understand and act upon visual, interactive insights. Analysis of critical success factors such as mobile subscriber experience, network performance, and subscriber churn is helping CellRebel\u2019s customers drive revenue growth with the platform. Mobile operators typically spend billions of dollars annually on improving their network infrastructure, with a goal to provide the most rewarding subscriber experience. Every day, these mobile operators invest in capacity expansion, service optimisation, and the introduction of new technologies such as 5G. However, despite the massive volumes of data available to these mobile operators, it is often difficult to understand the true subscriber experience. Moreover, mobile operators frequently lack comparative insights into competitor or market performance. Against this backdrop, Tibor Rathonyi and his colleagues established CellRebel. \u201cOur strategy at launch was to provide an easy-to-use solution for mobile operators to better understand their network, subscribers, and overall dynamics in the market they operate in, and take actions to improve their business,\u201d explains Tibor, CEO, CellRebel. CellRebel operates in the business-to-business (B2B) sector. More than 100 billion daily data samples collected from billions of smartphones, thousands of content and app providers, and more than 800 cloud providers are helping mobile operators and consultancy services better understand and improve their end-user customer experience. Tibor explains how the service works. \u201cA mobile operator subscribing to the CellRebel service simply logs into our secure portal and instantly views real-time metrics into a wealth of competitive intelligence \u2013 everything from market-wide network performance and competitor customer experience, to subscriber behaviour.\u201d The challenge for CellRebel at the launch of this forward-thinking B2B service was how to present such valuable data to their customers, in a way that was easy to understand. Tibor continues, \u201cWe\u2019d built the architecture to collect, analyse, and aggregate the big data samples from our different ecosystem partners. However, that data is only valuable if customers can interact with it and understand it. We needed a solution for mobile operators to make fast, informed decisions based on the data.\u201d \u201cAs a young organisation, we didn\u2019t have the time or resources to build an embedded solution in-house. Tableau, by contrast, answered all our needs, so we embedded it in our portal. It\u2019s easy for business users like myself to analyse quickly. The functionality is incredibly powerful, and it connects to multiple data sources with zero fuss.\u201d Mobile operators and consultancy service providers can now access Tableau\u2019s powerful self-service analytics directly in CellRebel\u2019s web portal. A CellRebel customer in Asia is using the portal to understand how its user experience compares with other local operators \u2013 such as average mobile screen page load times or video streaming buffering. The customer accesses the secure portal and the data is immediately brought to life through interactive analytics, allowing them to see aggregated summaries or drill down into the specifics. For example, they can compare page load time performance by geography, time of day, type of device \u2013 even down to the granular detail of phone model or local village. By utilising the insights and knowledge from CellRebel\u2019s solution, the operator has improved its network performance and created a faster, more rewarding experience for their customers. \u201cTableau\u2019s stand-out feature is the interactivity,\u201d says Tibor. \u201cOperators can instantly see what the data is telling them and ask more questions. They can share what they\u2019ve discovered. Embedding Tableau has enabled users to find opportunities in their business that they have never seen before.\u201d Tableau is also helping CellRebel\u2019s operator customers to understand more about subscriber addition and churn. A customer in Asia-Pacific, for example, relies on CellRebel to view the net subscriber movement between mobile operators. Analysing this data allows them to better target sales campaigns at customers most likely to churn \u2013 introducing personalised offers and other marketing tactics to boost loyalty. \u201cOne of the great advantages to Tableau is how quickly we can create dashboards and let customers explore the data,\u201d says Tibor. \u201cIf a customer wants to know about user experience in a particular cellular area, for instance, we can develop and present that back in just hours, ready for them to explore further. Customers don\u2019t need to be technical experts to interrogate and analyse the data and build logic around it. It\u2019s all incredibly intuitive and simple using the CellRebel portal.\u201d Feedback from CellRebel customers has been overwhelmingly positive. \u201cThe visual analytics is helping to make our customers more \u2018sticky\u2019, more loyal,\u201d says Tibor. \u201cThey can ask questions of the data and head off in new analytical directions. They are continually finding unexpected insights that drive better business performance.\u201d Security, scalability, and flexibility are key to CellRebel\u2019s solution. Tibor explains, \u201cTableau integrates into our existing technologies using single sign-on and we trust the technology for its enterprise-grade security. Tableau also scales seamlessly in line with our growth. In Indonesia, for example, we already integrate billions of data points every month, across 80 million devices. Tableau scales with whatever volume of data we put against it.\u201d Tibor concludes, \u201cTableau is really helping drive CellRebel\u2019s growth. Customers find huge value in accessing vast amounts of data and exploring it so easily. By helping our customers make fast, effective and informed decisions on factors like end user experience and network performance, we are driving their revenue growth \u2013 and ultimately ours too.\u201d"

        "content": "With the COVID-19 pandemic gripping the world, Polish hospitals and care homes were in desperate need of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other essential supplies. Here, Jakub Tabedzki of Clorce (a Salesforce Partner), and Jakub Jasiczak of Poznan University of Economics discuss how they transformed uncoordinated grassroots efforts into a cohesive and efficient network of hospital and care home support, powered by Salesforce and Tableau. This is an abridged version of the full interview - read more on the Salesforce website. Tell us how Wsparcie dla Szpitala started?\nJakub Jasiczak: In mid-March I thought, \u201cWe\u2019re stuck at home, there must be some way we can be useful.\u201d Around 60 of my colleagues \u2013 scientists from various universities in Poland \u2013 felt the same way, so we started the Virtual Crisis Institute to offer our help to fight COVID-19. One of our ideas was around managing donations of supplies. We saw people calling hospitals, driving there with bottles of water, volunteers trying to track everything manually using spreadsheets\u2026 it was chaos. That day, I saw a Facebook post from Jakub offering Clorce\u2019s expertise to build a new platform, and Wsparciedlaszpitala.pl was born. Jakub Tabedzki: In five days the developers at Clorce built a service, based on Salesforce.org\u2019s package for NGOs, that allowed hospitals to create lists of what they needed. We started with five volunteers, who we trained in Salesforce on the fly \u2013 teaching them how to create leads, convert and manage leads \u2013 and they onboarded 100 hospitals over the phone. The pandemic context evolved quickly. How have you had to pivot to adapt as the situation developed?\nJT: As new use cases came up, we\u2019ve added elements to the organisation and the digital platform. Five volunteers wasn\u2019t enough, so we scaled up to 30. By day 10, we had created a new type of account for local coordinators, so they could go through hospitals\u2019 lists and mark what people could provide. When donations are delivered, the lists update in real-time. At the 15-day mark, we got famous. We had a 2-minute slot on a headline TV news show about COVID-19, and the site got thousands of hits. This was the day we added a new account type so ordinary people could join, find a hospital and see what was needed, then tell local coordinators what they could provide \u2013 no phone calls or Facebook messages needed. JJ: The local coordinators are crucial to the process \u2013 they provide the link between the public and the hospitals. They build connections with companies and the media, too. Can you share how you\u2019re using data? It seems like a crucial piece of the process.\nJT: We used Tableau to build the main dashboard that you see on the site, which shows you the needs of each hospital at a glance. You can filter by need, and search by location. Tableau employees have been amazing at sharing their expertise with us \u2013 one of their engineers even worked with us directly. As well as this main dashboard, we also built non-public-facing dashboards to track hospitals that don\u2019t have local coordinators, and to handle media enquiries. We\u2019re not only visualising and sharing data, we\u2019re learning from it, too. We knew that hospitals would need things like masks, but when you get diagnosed with COVID-19, you go into isolation and can\u2019t take anything with you. How are you going to wash or brush your teeth? So hospitals also need things like toothbrushes. JJ: We found that there was a mismatch between what hospitals need and what ordinary people can provide \u2013 to get masks and gowns, we realised we had to connect local coordinators to companies. We\u2019re now buying supplies directly from Poland\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical wholesaler. JT: We heard from one hospital that they were using baby monitors so that doctors could communicate with patients without going into their rooms. So we sent an email to 200 hospitals saying, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re running low on PPE, why not try using baby monitors?\u201d This is an example of how we\u2019re not just distributing donations, we\u2019re sharing knowledge too."

The Everton Academy is where Everton Football Club nurtures its exceptional young talent towards the first-team, supporting them in their journeys towards the professional game. Here, the Academy\u2019s Nick Coleman, Sam Bailey, and Owen O'Connor discuss how Tableau is helping Everton drive player performance and recruit the very best talent. Prior to Tableau, our biggest challenge was combining and exploring large amounts of non-uniform datasets. Too much time was devoted to processing the data, not enough on analysing it to develop our young players. Different functions like recruitment, coaching, and sports science were using different systems, the data was siloed, and we couldn\u2019t collaborate as we\u2019d have liked. This meant key insights that would improve the team\u2019s performance were missed. Sports science drove the initial Tableau deployment. They collected a mass of data on players \u2013 GPS tracking, fitness data, injury history \u2013 and used visual analytics to share instant, easily digestible insights with coaches, players, and other Academy functions. When we saw the positive impact this was having on players\u2019 development, we were inundated with requests for similar analysis. Our first step was to create a centralised analytics team within the Academy. By connecting the key player databases from departments like recruitment, coaching, performance analysis and sports science, employees are now able to explore an incredible amount of rich intelligence across the Academy. Those connections are providing insights that couldn\u2019t be spotted previously, transforming how the Academy progresses upcoming talent. As part of our performance analysis strategy, we rely on Tableau to analyse Under-18 Everton Academy players compared to our opposition, studying measures like possession, completed passes, pass accuracy, shots on target - in short, everything. We can monitor this at a team level or drill down into individuals, for example comparing forward passes player X made in the final third, versus player Y. From there, we can look at why that\u2019s the case, and define individual plans and team tactics ahead of our next match. Because Tableau allows such intuitive, interactive analysis, the performance analysts and coaches can share these insights with players for post-match analysis and individual feedback with ease. Tableau is highly adaptable and flexible, meaning we\u2019re confident our system can handle any future demands that professional football might throw at us. We want to give our young, exceptional talent a pathway to the first team \u2013 and Tableau is instrumental. We recognise that adolescent players mature at a different rate, and that their form will fluctuate at different times in their growth. Without data-driven insights, it\u2019s easy to assume any change in the player is a long-term performance issue, leading to them being released from the Academy. Now, with Tableau\u2019s help, we have a granular view of their entire profile, from growth and development, to on-pitch performance and player care. Using this holistic view, we can pinpoint why a player\u2019s form is fluctuating. More importantly, we can then create bespoke programmes for each individual to continue their progress. We\u2019re really proud to see so many Academy players graduate to the first-team. The Academy has a large intake from grassroots football, and our scouts are out there in all weathers measuring and benchmarking player performance. Tableau ensures that this knowledge is no longer solely in people\u2019s heads but is accessible, and can be explored and interrogated in great detail. In Professional Recruitment we have more information at hand to make informed decisions. We can dive deeper into historical match reports and player performances, meaning we can challenge opinion and gut instinct with key insights and trends we\u2019re uncovering. Analysing all this information at scale helps determine future Academy recruitment strategies \u2013 by organising our scouting network and prioritising key areas, we can act quicker and more decisively to recruit the right talent. Professional football is an incredibly competitive field. Our data-culture empowers the Academy to compete at the highest level, and it\u2019s maturing all the time. Each department uses Tableau to support their decision-making, and we have data champions to provide training and drive adoption. We\u2019re working more collaboratively than ever before and sharing insights with ease. Ultimately, this is helping our young players maximise their potential, creating sustained success on the pitch."

        "company": "Community Medical Centers",
        "content": "Community Medical Centers (CMC) is a network of 22 neighborhood health centers based in Stockton, California. Started as a volunteer effort in the 1960s to serve agricultural workers, it has grown into a thriving nonprofit providing vital care to men, women, and children, regardless of ability to pay. CMC offers a wide range of services, including medical care, health outreach and education, behavioral health services, dental care, and HIV early intervention. Last year, CMC served over 100,000 patients across three counties and continues to grow. In 2017, CMC had very limited capabilities for analyzing their data and presenting insights\u2014or even the raw data itself\u2014to the users who needed it. Developing solutions on their existing SQL Server Reporting Services platform took too long for each project to achieve real value, leading to a backlog of analytics requests and many challenges for delivering timely executive reporting. After searching the market for visualization tools, CMC landed on Tableau, which had a pricing model and on-premises option that fit well with the health center's needs. To date, CMC has built more than 70 Tableau dashboards and conducted in-house orientation classes that have helped Tableau adoption reach leadership teams and other personnel in all of their facilities. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has made this access to analytics more vital than ever before, in part because of the increased reliance on telehealth visits. As a community health center, CMC relies heavily on in-person patient visits to sustain its operating budget. But the coronavirus crisis drastically reduced CMC\u2019s number of in-person visits, threatening to decimate the organization\u2019s operating budget. But this year, the virus threatened to decimate those revenues due to the risks of seeing and treating patients face-to-face. In April 2020, the National Association of Community Health Centers projected 34 million fewer in-person visits in the community health subsector over six months, resulting in $7.6 billion in lost revenue and more than 100,000 lost jobs. California was the U.S. state predicted to lose the most revenue by far, with more than twice the projected losses of the second state on the list, New York. Before COVID-19, telehealth visits were not offered at CMC. But with the pandemic threatening the livelihood of the medical center, CMC was able to quickly pivot to offer most visits virtually in order to protect both staff and patients. The analytics team immediately created new Tableau dashboards to track the progress of this telehealth change. CEO Christine Noguera and her leadership team are now using these daily reports to understand the direction the organization is going and to share progress across the organization. Using information from new COVID-19 Tableau dashboards, CMC clinicians conduct virtual patient sessions to provide care, advice, intervention, and monitoring, on both virus-related and non-virus cases. Data analytics supported every step of the process, providing holistic views of patient data as well as a risk stratification protocol for determining which patients had priority to visit a facility for further care. Telehealth capabilities not only helped financially by allowing for billable consultations throughout the statewide shutdown, but also helped CMC optimize care delivery and build trust in the community by assuring patients that their health centers were open for the most necessary services. Other advantages of using data visualization at CMC during COVID-19 include: CMC also regularly participates in analytics or technology user groups and coalitions, and many of the organizations they collaborate with also use Tableau or are interested in seeing their analytics in Tableau. By uniting around the shared challenges they face, these groups can use the common medium of visual analytics to learn from each other and grow stronger together. In this way, data plays a pivotal role in sustaining healthy, tight-knit communities at multiple levels: improving the efficacy of care teams and administrators at CMC, reinforcing their affiliation with other community health centers, and supporting better health outcomes for the central California populations they serve."

        "content": "Landal GreenParks is a market leader in the field of holiday resort management, operation and rentals. The Dutch company has 90 holiday parks across Europe, which collectively welcome over 2.8 million holidaymakers every year. Here, Frans-Dick Goudart, BI Team Lead, and Johnno Pastor, Data Scientist, at Landal GreenParks, discuss how the company uses Tableau to accurately track park performance and cut time to insight in key operational areas, fostering a powerful data-driven culture amongst employees in the process. What role does data analytics play in Landal GreenParks\u2019 operations?\nData analytics plays a huge role in everything we do as a business. With 90 holiday parks across nine European countries, we collect a wealth of data on everything from incoming bookings and revenues, to ongoing park capacities and staffing levels. Analysing these diverse data sets in the right ways, using the right tools, helps us uncover previously hidden insights that enable us to keep improving the experience we offer at every one of our parks. How does Tableau help you achieve this?\nTableau\u2019s flexibility and ease of use make it the ideal platform for our analytics needs. With just a small amount of training, employees can quickly start using it to answer their own questions, greatly improving time to insight for everyone. Tableau\u2019s automated reporting also adds powerful functionality and interactive visualisation capabilities to our existing reporting infrastructure. It reduces manual processes, cuts lead times, and enables faster, more informed decision making across the business. To assist with this, we have Tableau champions in every department where Tableau is used, helping to create new dashboards, share best-practice, and importantly, teach colleagues how they can get the most out of the platform on a daily basis. Do you have an example you can share of how Tableau is helping cut time to insight?\nYes, each of our parks has its own performance report called a Fact Sheet. These reports contain KPIs on every aspect of the park, such as rental revenues, occupancy levels and guest satisfaction ratings over time. Before Tableau it would take three or four employees several weeks to manually compile each individual report, so we could only do them annually. Now, these reports are automated in Tableau and updated every month, giving a much clearer snapshot of individual park performance throughout the course of the year, not just at the end of it. This means we can spot potential issues earlier and ensure the service we\u2019re delivering across our parks always exceeds customers\u2019 expectations. Why did you choose Tableau Cloud?\nLandal GreenParks has a cloud-first policy and Tableau Cloud fits perfectly with this. It allows us to put self-service analytics into the hands of our employees quickly, and scales effortlessly when needed. Tableau Cloud also provides us with a secure platform to share key insights as soon as they are ready, removing unnecessary barriers to collaboration. What impact has self-service analytics had on overall business efficiency?\nImplementing self-service analytics has bridged the gap between business and IT, helping to foster a powerful new data culture within Landal GreenParks. Teams can now work closely together in Tableau, interacting with the data, developing new dashboards and uncovering key insights that allow them to make faster, more data driven decisions every day. How is Tableau helping you navigate through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic?\nFast access to accurate analytics has never been more critical. Using Tableau, we can answer questions as they arise and quickly respond to the changing needs of the business at this unprecedented time. For example, analysis of the latest bookings, cancellations and refunds taking place across our parks means we can spot new trends and make key decisions based on the facts in front of us, rather than relying on guesswork."

        "company": "Gyeonggi Infectious Disease Control Center",
        "content": "Gyeonggi Infectious Disease Control Center (GIDCC) is the first Korean regional-scale institute founded to \"regionalize management of infectious disease\" for more effective control on them. GIDCC is developing a system that meets the demand for infectious disease monitoring, epidemiological study, and statistical data analysis in Gyeonggi-do with the provision of professional and prompt information. GIDCC also shares infectious disease data with related institutions in real-time, such as the provincial government and health center, and makes the data available to its local residents in order to support their active efforts to prevent infectious diseases. \"We have established an effective system for managing infectious diseases using Tableau. With Tableau, various data sources related to the diseases are connected for analysis, and information useful for controlling infectious diseases is extracted and turned into dashboards to be shared with related institutions and residents. In addition, the system enabled the persons concerned inside and outside GIDCC to simplify statistical analysis and reporting and concentrate more on the work related to the set-up of infectious disease policies,\" said Hee-young Lee, head of GIDCC. GIDCC introduced Tableau first in 2015 when the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) crisis occurred, in order to analyze the outbreak of infectious diseases accurately and quickly. Since then, GIDCC has enabled its researchers to improve productivity by using the easy-to-use and simple data visualization and advanced analytics capabilities of Tableau. To successfully control the spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) this year, GIDCC\nhas arranged the data on confirmed patients and persons contacted by patients across 31 cities and districts in Gyeonggi-do using Tableau, and analyzed it using various metrics such as the region, route of infection, gender, age and so forth. In particular, GIDCC could develop a powerful disease monitoring system by gaining insight into the trends of COVID-19 confirmed patients and data on contacted persons in real-time, using Tableau. With a single source of view based on Tableau, they analyzed public health and epidemiological study data from various sources efficiently. They also effectively supported the tracing and management of confirmed patients and the people they have had contact with, which is key to controlling infectious diseases, by producing the result of the analysis of COVID-19 outbreak in real time. \"Tableau significantly simplified our analysis process. To conduct various studies on the prevention of infectious diseases and its spread more productively, we collected data using Tableau from the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC), National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS), National Health Insurance Service, epidemiological studies, and perform advanced analysis such as statistics,\" said Hee-young Lee, head of GIDCC. With Tableau, GIDCC researchers and external health officials became able to make decisions more quickly based on a lot of data, when formulating policy for the prevention of infectious disease and control of its spread, including COVID-19. GIDCC researchers efficiently perform advanced analysis like statistics, using Tableau. In addition, replacing repetitive manual tasks with Tableau from data query, extraction, and cleaning to report generation, they improved business productivity significantly. As a result, researches can focus more on establishing and implementing effective policies by using infectious disease information, instead of the traditional time-consuming analysis process. Besides, GIDCC is effectively collaborating with Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC), the provincial government, and health centres by sharing the analysis results about COVID-19 and other infectious diseases on Tableau Server. \"As most people are concerned about the socio-economic damage caused by the worldwide spread of COVID-19 since December of last year, we support policies designed to contain the spread of COVID-19 by sharing the analysis result of COVID-19 outbreak with related institutes transparently in real-time, using Tableau. While we're making time-sensitive efforts to fight against infectious diseases like COVID-19 in these days, Tableau has allowed us to view dashboards in real time, visualizing the status of infectious disease outbreak by cities and districts in Gyeonggi-do, gender, age, and route of infection, together with data on confirmed patients and contacted persons across Gyeonggi-do. The dashboard plays a key role for the internal GIDCC researchers and external health care personnel to forecast the future trends and establish the policy for infectious disease prevention, based on the common understanding on the trends of the progress of infectious disease outbreak,\" said Hee-young Lee, head of GIDCC. On the other hand, PLAN-iT, Tableau's Korean partner, provided training, advisory, and consulting services on the use of Tableau, so that internal and external GIDCC personnel can nurture their data analysis capabilities. With Tableau, GIDCC developed various types of intuitive dashboards that show the changing trends of the number of confirmed patients across Gyeonggi-do. All residents in Gyeonggi-do can check the various information posted on the GIDCC website. This information includes the rate of the spread of the disease over time, the appearance of disease spread in the local community, the incidence rate on the maps and graphs showing the \"status of COVID-19 outbreak in Gyeonggi-do\", \"status of national COVID-19 outbreak\", and \"status of infectious disease in Gyeonggi-do\". Regarding COVID-19 outbreak in Gyeonggi-do, GIDCC updates the dashboard with various information daily, such as the cumulative status of the confirmed patients by cities and districts, the overall status of confirmed patients across Gyeonggi-do, the percentage of confirmed patients by gender and age, the confirmed number of patients by infection route (overseas inflow, unclear) and days from symptom onset to confirmation. GIDCC plans to develop more dashboards to provide diverse and valuable information for the prevention of infectious diseases. For example, by using the new dashboard, GIDCC will be able to provide insights into infectious disease clusters, the status of discharged and hospitalized patients, daily Rt value (time-dependent Reproduction rate) which indicates infectivity in consideration of the frequency of contact with an infected person, the infectious period and evaluate the trends of positive rate changes. \"As all public health experts and residents in Gyeonggi-do can look at Tableau dashboards to understand about the status of infectious disease outbreak very easily, it helped us a lot to support the effort of preventing infectious diseases in the public and private sector,\" said Yeon-hui Seong, researcher of GIDCC."

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tunisian emergency services saw a sudden, dramatic spike in incoming phone calls. They received more than 450,000 calls in the first month of the pandemic\u2014the equivalent of two years' worth in pre-pandemic times. Unable to reach an operator, citizens were calling up to 10 times each. While some calls were placed to a dedicated COVID-19 hotline, many were placed to 1-9-0, the country's general emergency number. The volume of calls put a strain on emergency services, restricting their ability to provide fast, effective care to those who needed it most. The number of virus-related calls to 1-9-0, rather than to the hotline, limited MTCEN's efforts to track the spread of the virus. Greater understanding of their call data was key to organizing a consistent, effective response to the virus. MTCEN worked alongside Tableau partner Targa Consult and Ooredoo, Tunisia\u2019s largest telecommunications provider, to create dashboards that provide critical insights into call volumes, times, and geographical variation. Operational in just 24 hours, the dashboards allowed emergency doctors to explore and interact with the call data, and make necessary operational changes. MTCEN discovered that 57% of calls to the emergency number were under 30 seconds, indicating callers were hanging up before reaching an operator. By visualizing average call length and average number of calls per person, operators can now call people back who were unable to reach the emergency number, ensuring citizens receive the critical response they need. The data justified MTCEN developing a public communications campaign that promoted the COVID-19 hotline, while a redirect solution was built to divert non-emergency calls. These improvements provided greater clarity into the call data, and by understanding call density and geographical variation, local emergency services can now monitor trends and identify contamination clusters across the country. Additionally, analyzing peak call times allows the government to manage emergency team response and other resources more effectively, helping them stay ahead of the virus."

But how can a company harness such huge amounts of data in order to actually improve their business? This was one of the challenges for Deutsche Bahn (DB) Group as they embarked on their digital transformation journey. Finding solutions fell on the shoulders of DB Systel, the 5,100 employee strong digital partner for all DB Group companies, to drive cultural change. By putting trusted data at the heart of the organisation, DB Systel are enabling DB Group businesses to collaborate more easily and flexibly than before. Increased business agility and an emphasis on innovation ensures the network operates efficiently and that customers receive the best possible experience on every journey. Claudia Plattner, Chief Information Officer (CIO), DB Systel explains, \u201cWe want everyone to connect and collaborate with one version of the truth. We have a single \u2018data universe\u2019 that allows all employees at DB Systel to explore their data securely, gain crucial insights, and make agile, informed decisions that drive change.\u201d Manual reporting is time consuming and would become a bottleneck to the company\u2019s transformation, Claudia and her team turned to Tableau. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a new data culture,\u201d says Karolina Sch\u00e4fer, Product Owner for internal reporting, DB Systel. \u201cPeople trust the data they are using. By sharing the insights, it sparks new questions and draws out new ideas that might otherwise have been missed.\u201d Tableau is scaling seamlessly to support users within both DB Systel and the DB Group. 600 employees in DB Systel and more than 5,000 across DB Group are now asking questions of data in Tableau. \u201cIt\u2019s so intuitive. A new user can find insights that change the way they work within an hour, and these results mean its popularity is growing faster than we could have imagined. The adoption rate is doubling every three months,\u201d says Dr. Marc Stanke, Enterprise Architect, DB Systel. DB Group\u2019s network of local train maintenance depots rely on Tableau to understand and exceed key performance indicators (KPIs) for example for maintenance schedules. \u201cEvery Monday, the maintenance teams study the analysis, discussing how they can work together more closely to make local maintenance more efficient. This open collaboration supports having more trains available on the network to meet passenger demand, improving the customer experience,\u201d says Tobias Wolf, Product Owner for Command Your Business Data, DB Systel. Senior DB Group management use valuable insights for planning future strategy, covering everything from daily ticket revenues and service punctuality, to distances travelled by passengers, customer satisfaction metrics, and more. Likewise, more than 500 station managers are finding solutions that enhance operational excellence and the customer experience as a result. \u201cIntuitive, interactive dashboards let employees explore the data themselves. Allowing teams to ask questions of data unlocks their curiosity and unleashes their creativity. Everyone has a stake in finding solutions\u201d Tobias adds. DB Systel shares IT service management insights across the DB Group so stakeholders can review technology performance. The rail freight organisation, for instance, automatically receives updates into the quality of IT service provided by DB Systel, including system performance and uptime. \u201cThis service team reporting used to absorb two days of a person\u2019s time every month, now it takes just 15 minutes,\u201d says Karolina. \u201cWe\u2019re now able to use this time to focus on strategic projects.\u201d As the CIO for DB Systel, Claudia sees the impact Tableau is having across the Group every day.

        "company": "NTT Docomo ",
        "content": "NTT Docomo doesn\u2019t just provide mobile phone services. It has also developed multiple services centered on its d POINT CLUB. In order to get a better understanding of its customers, it built a new data platform in March 2017. Tableau plays an important role as the front end of this platform. So why did they revamp their data platform with Tableau? And what kind of effects will they achieve with it? We spoke to Taku Hasegawa, an executive officer at NTT Docomo who is also a key player in promoting utilization of data. Proactively taking advantage of data to get a better understanding of our customers. Recently, the number of companies promoting efforts to realize this kind of \u201cdata-driven\u201d management has increased sharply. One company that has already implemented this on a big scale is NTT Docomo (\u201cNTT\u201d). \u201cWe sell through Docomo shops operated by third party distributors, which severely limits opportunities for direct contact with our customers,\u201d says Taku Hasegawa, Executive Officer and General Manager of the Information Systems Department at NTT Docomo. He has long considered the effective use of data as indispensable to understanding customers. \u201cWe had already accumulated a huge amount of data internally about our customers over the last 25 years. We already had granular data at our fingertips, such as information about when each customer ordered what, and through which channel. If you can aggregate and visualize all of that data, you should know what kind of problems that products or channels have and what kind of services the customers want. I have come to consider this as the foundation of data-driven management\u201d. Mr. Hasegawa has been pursuing this kind of data-driven management at NTT Docomo for more than 20 years. However, at one time there were many obstacles, and it was difficult to realize in the way he wanted. His breakthrough was triggered by the introduction of the SAP HANA in-memory database in March 2017. This enabled the aggregation of huge amounts of data that could be searched at lightning speed. However, you can\u2019t realize data-driven management with just high-speed search functions. There also has to be a mechanism for visualizing the searched data and extracting insights from it. That\u2019s why Tableau was introduced with SAP HANA. Even if you can process a huge amount of data quickly, I don\u2019t think that users would want to use it with a traditional BI that requires the intervention of a report writer. Also, if you provide an environment in which users can access the database by themselves, only a limited number of users can use the database if it\u2019s complicated and difficult to operate. In order to broaden the unmediated use of data by users throughout the company, we need to provide tools in a responsive format that makes them want to use them. This is made possible by Tableau\u201d. NTT Docomo owns 6,000 servers. The systems running on these servers contain a huge amount of transaction data (approx. 62 petabytes). They aggregated this data in SAP HANA and established a platform that enabled real-time data analysis. They also deployed Tableau within the company and built an environment that allowed about 1,800 members of the sales team to use it. After that, they expanded their userbase in the Management Planning Department, Finance Department and Service Department. According to Mr. Hasegawa, it now has more than 11,000 unique monthly users (as of October 2019). To promote user education, they set up an \u201cAmbassador Academy\u201d with Tableau Software, Inc. They expanded end users by training key people as \u201cambassadors\u201d who could analyze data using BI tools and train talent and by giving them promotional roles in each branch office. The idea behind this was that the whole company had to become data driven. There is no domestic precedent for operating an Ambassador Academy on this kind of scale. \u201cIt\u2019s only about two years since we introduced Tableau, but I feel that we are in the process of establishing a culture of decision-making based on a firm grasp of data. This is because the hurdles to data usage have shrunk while the speed of data use has also increased dramatically. This has also allowed us to run our business processes faster. Tableau has now become an integral part of daily work, to the extent that we can\u2019t remember how we managed to do our jobs before it\u201d. Beforehand, whenever they had a managerial meeting, the staff had to come to the office at 6am to prepare materials for it. This involved extracting the data and creating graphs in Excel, but Tableau has rendered that work redundant. The freshness of the data that can be used for meetings has also improved. This is because the Tableau dashboard, which can be viewed on handheld devices, shows you data from the morning of the meeting. \u201cAfter using Tableau in practice, the thing that I thought was fantastic is its expressive capabilities. With just a few intuitive user actions. it displays the data that you want to see in the format that you want to see it in. It also displays the data quickly, allowing you to look at successive sets of data without interrupting your train of thought. Every day I\u2019m impressed by how amazing it is to be able to able to use data flexibly\u201d. If you can utilize very fresh data immediately, you can also speed up hypothesis testing cycles. You can speed up things like establishing a hypothesis after looking at data, formulating a solution based on that hypothesis and then establishing the next hypothesis after viewing the data from the result of implementing that solution. Mr. Hasegawa says that being able to do things like these without interrupting their train of thought has increased employees\u2019 curiosity and motivation. \u201cThe introduction of Tableau has allowed us to realize the kind of \u201cself BI\u201d that we found difficult previously. It also provides an environment in which users can create their own dashboards. As a result of this, the previous work we had to do creating materials is no longer required, saving us several billon yen each year. We started promoting Tableau from the top down, but once employers saw its benefits, they asked to use it of their own accord. It generated a cycle of success stories thereby increasing users who then create even more success stories\u201d. So, what kind of results can be expected on the business front from a Tableau-based self BI? One of the benefits pointed out by Mr. Hasegawa is the strengthening of their relationship with customers through d POINTs. \u201cOur mobile phone business is already saturated, and the market will also taper off in the future due to a decreasing population. So, it will become important to widen our relationship with customers by providing services other than mobile phones. If you become a member of our d POINT CLUB, you can use services, such as \u201cd magazine,\u201d \u201cd shopping\u201d and \u201cd travel,\u201d even if you don\u2019t use the NTT Docomo mobile phone service. By digitizing contact points with customers through these services, we can collect data that allows us to understand more about our customers. Visualizing this data in Tableau enables us to provide services based on this deeper understanding, which should help drive our continued growth in the future. The advent of the 5G era and gearing up of the business development of digital twins should increase the importance of these kinds of data platforms\u201d. He goes on to point out that an expansion of data use also makes a major contribution to work style reform. \u201cWe have already created a personnel management dashboard in the HR Department and have started to automate the personnel management work that used to be done manually, such as aggregation and tabulation. This has allowed us to detect overwork and variations in workload at an early stage while increasing the efficiency of our HR management operations\u201d. They also plan to progress collaboration with RFA and AI in the future. This is because it will allow them to concentrate their limited manpower on more essential work. For example, he expects AI to allow them to automatically customize the dashboard for each user and to advise them on how to look at it. They are also aiming to realize data-driven management on a company-wide scale, as mentioned earlier. They are currently strengthening their data infrastructure in order to support that target. \u201cIn order to put the whole company on a data-driven footing, we first need to provide data in a usable format,\u201d says Mr. Hasegawa. A lot of companies are currently struggling at this stage, but he says that the really important thing is the next stage, in other words, how to present that data. \u201cYou need tools like Tableau to do this properly, but you also need the enthusiasm to change the company culture with strong leadership. Company culture doesn\u2019t just change naturally all by itself. However, once you start that process and can share its results, a positive feedback loop kicks in and it snowballs its way across the company. We still have several challenges in our company too, but I would like to continue our proactive efforts to achieve data-driven management\u201d."

According to SatSure\u2014an expert in satellite remote sensing and big data analytics\u2014one of the key issues has been disruption to normal supply chains. With local markets, transport companies, and warehouses shut down, farmers are forced to find alternative ways to get food to buyers. SatSure has stepped up to help alongside three other companies: Numer8, KrishiHub, and ThinkAg. Together, they have created a non-commercial map which helps to connect different players in India\u2019s agricultural supply chain. These include farmers and buyers as well as logistics, storage, and agri-machinery companies across the country. Data for the map, referred to as the Essential Supplies Exchange is collected from public agencies and also crowd-sourced using a simple Google Form where people can register their supplies or services. The data is then plotted on the map and made searchable using Tableau. Using this visualization allows farmers, traders, and consumers to easily find and connect with those who can transport, store, or help to process or sell their goods. A recent example of this was a tomato farmer who was able to find a driver to transport 50 tonnes of tomatoes to a buyer in a nearby city and a family in Vile Parle who were delivered fresh sea fish at midnight by connecting over the platform. Without the Essential Supplies Exchange, these food items might have otherwise gone to waste. Sarvesh Kurane, AVP, Value Engineering from SatSure says that while the map is important in connecting the supply chain, it can also be useful in informing the government\u2019s response to the crisis and the relief packages provided by banks. \u201cThe Essential Supplies Exchange is the only resource out there that provides all of this information in one place and it can be really valuable in ensuring that the sector is able to move goods to the right place. Once we start to overlay details like which crops will be harvested next, the map will also help with forward planning.\u201d"

While hospital leadership prepared UChicago Medicine's operational response to COVID-19, there was an urgent and large demand for new data and reporting. Tasked with continuing to enable leadership, clinicians, and administrators to make the most data-driven decisions possible, the UChicago Medicine Data & Analytics team needed to quickly create new dashboards. Partnerships across clinical care, analytics, and IT sought to leverage existing data infrastructure to provide the most meaningful COVID-19 reporting possible for the organization. These included: To create these dashboards, the UChicago Medicine Data & Analytics team partnered with IT, Infection Control, ICU clinicians, and operational leadership to prioritize data needs and ensure the reporting being developed provided immediate value. While this effort and collaboration continues today, this suite of reporting has quickly become UChicago Medicine's most viewed internal reporting. The first wave of dashboards was developed over the course of a few weeks, but the team has continued to enhance and develop reporting as the organization's COVID-19 response evolves. UChicago Medicine has made starter kit versions of these dashboards available for other healthcare organizations to download and customize for their own purposes. Each jumpstart dashboard includes pre-designed desktop and mobile-friendly visualizations connected to placeholder data sources. (Please note that none of the data presented in these reflect current or past patient outcomes at UChicago Medicine.) Other institutions can download these dashboards and replace the placeholder data with connections to their own data sources.

        "title": "How Henkel saves millions of euros per year across its award-winning digital supply chain with Tableau",
        "company": "Henkel ",
        "content": "Henkel is one of the world\u2019s leading chemical and consumer goods companies. Headquartered in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, it employs more than 52,000 staff across its three major divisions: Laundry & Home Care, Adhesives Technologies, and Beauty Care. Here, Dr Johannes Holtbruegge, Senior Manager Digital Transformation at Henkel Laundry & Home Care, discusses how the company uses Tableau as part of its innovative digital supply chain, to identify millions of euros in operational savings and empower employees with self-serve analytics. In recognition of its industry-leading approach, Henkel was recognized as an Advanced 4th Industrial Revolution Lighthouse by the World Economic Forum (WEF) this year. What role does data play in Henkel\u2019s operations? Like so many multinational organisations today, effective data reporting and analytics are critical to Henkel. When operating on such a large scale, even the smallest savings in areas like the supply chain can be worth millions of euros. The more accurate we can be with our data, the more likely we are to identify where such savings can be made. When did you first implement Tableau at Henkel? We implemented Tableau in 2016 after a supplier recommended it to us. Before that, we were using simplistic reporting and analytics tools. These were enough for basic tasks, but as our data needs become more sophisticated, they couldn\u2019t provide the advanced functionality we required. Migrating to Tableau marked a turning point for us. We first started connecting our factories worldwide to a central data repository in 2013. Still, it was only after we moved to Tableau that we realised how much of our data we could centralise in one place and the value it could bring in terms of increasing efficiency and identifying cost savings. We now have all of our supply chain data consolidated through Tableau, from a range of sources including Dremio, Oracle, Excel Cubes and more. Doing so has created a single source that everyone in the business can access and use together for the first time. What kind of savings have you achieved as a result? In 2019 alone, we identified energy and cost savings worth \u20ac4 million, much of which is the direct result of better data visibility and transparency. We\u2019ve also been able to reduce energy consumption across our Laundry & Home Care global supply chain by 20 per cent and improve the efficiency of our factories by over 10 per cent since 2013. Interestingly, all our factories around the world can now see each other\u2019s energy usage and power data in Tableau, which has created healthy competition between them over who can be the most energy-efficient. Do you have a specific example of Tableau analysis leading to significant savings? Of course. The production of washing detergent powder is a crucial part of our business. Still, it\u2019s an very energy-intensive process, and the spray towers which turn liquid detergent into powder flakes are highly sensitive to even small fluctuations in temperature and humidity. If conditions are too hot or too humid, their efficiency can be severely affected. However, using Tableau we were able to correlate local weather data against our tower operating schedule, ensuring production was maximised at times where the atmospheric conditions were optimal and vice versa. Doing so has helped to boost production energy efficiency by as much as 5%. You recently rolled out self-service analytics to all employees via Tableau. What impact has that had?\n\nWhenever I travel to one of our sites, I see the positive impact that self-service analytics has. Not only can employees now answer many of their own data questions in Tableau, but they can also prepare for meetings faster and share live data with anyone who needs it, in real-time and all at the touch of a button. In just six months, our Tableau community has grown from only a handful of central analysts to over 2,100 Henkel users, ranging from global managers to factory line operators. Many colleagues told me how impressed they are seeing all the things they can do with the data based on Tableau. Henkel was recently recognized as an Advanced 4th Industrial Revolution Lighthouse by the WEF. What role did Tableau play in this? The award from the WEF is a great recognition of our work we\u2019ve done to digitize the entire Laundry & Home Care supply chain, and Tableau has been central to that process. The WEF auditors were particularly impressed by our global approach, so much so that they created a whole new Lighthouse category for our initiative - End-to-End Connected Digital Lighthouse - which we took as a big compliment! Update (May 2020): How is Henkel using Tableau to navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic? Having Tableau in place, along with the right reports in Tableau Server, means that we've been able to use targeted analytics to maneuver through the COVID-19 crisis as smoothly as possible. All of our major KPIs are online and managers can easily access them from home, which greatly benefits our business steering efforts during this unprecedented time. We also rapidly built a number of important new reports in Tableau to assist with these efforts. This includes a dashboard to monitor our global stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE), ensuring employees are properly protected throughout our facilities. We have also created a sales and operations planning dashboard that managers can access remotely and use to support this critical alignment between disciplines on a local, regional and global level."

        "content": "Whole Foods Market is a natural foods supermarket chain with 460 stores throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The company has grown rapidly in the last few years and recent acquisitions resulted in disparate systems and data sources. As a result, analysts spent considerable time collecting and preparing data in Excel and other reporting tools\u2014and oftentimes, the resulting data wasn\u2019t always accurate, leading to diminished trust in the data with executives, store leaders, and frontline retail staff. Whole Foods Market embraced Tableau to create a single source of truth with their financial and operations data, offering a clear view of performance with staff across all nationwide stores. This takes shape through a series of dashboards. Store leaders can track performance against other stores in the surrounding areas with a regional dashboard. A sales dashboard allows store team leaders to drill down into specific departments to understand when they need to increase staffing based on peak hours of the day. And the terminal dashboard shows customer flow through checkout stands to help store leaders understand when they need to open or close a register. It also helps them track team member productivity so they can celebrate wins. As Whole Foods Market shifted its analytics approach, the analytics team designated a change management lead to institute best practices and check in with different departments to track adoption. They nurtured and grew a strong internal community centered around data and Tableau, with weekly contests, data doctor sessions, and a weekly video series highlighting Tableau product news and also created a training program for retail staff so they can use data to guide day-to-day stock and staff decisions. Today, Whole Foods Market has over 18,000 active Tableau users, transforming how the company approaches customer experience and operations on a daily basis."

The company began using the Content Migration Tool, included in Tableau Advanced Management, to efficiently migrate workbooks from its development environment to customer-facing views. Today, Carrot Health has replaced tedious, manual operations with 150 streamlined migration plans, consistently delivering more than 100 customized workbooks from 8 templates\u2014many jobs are now just a one-click operation. \u201cPrior to the Content Migration Tool, it was a very manual process\u2014downloading workbooks from our development environment and publishing them to our production server for our customers\u2019 use,\u201d said Candace Slattery, Senior Director of Security and Technical Operations. \u201cIt was very time consuming, wasn't a scalable solution, and didn\u2019t give us any level of compliance tracking.\u201d Now, instead of manually updating and tracking content migrations, Candace has streamlined jobs with the Content Migration Tool, making it easier to run them when needed and providing log files to attach to JIRA tickets for improved SOC 2 compliance tracking. \u201cWe have proof when production updates are made, with log files that indicate which workbooks were published and when,\u201d Candace said. \u201cIt's given us a level of detail around reporting that's way beyond what we had previously.\u201d Carrot Health uses more than 80 data sources, including medical claims and membership data, health indicators, market analysis, and third-party data, combined with more than 330 proprietary predictive models to help customers better understand, reach, and offer care to their consumers. Due to regional nuances for each customer, and to ensure HIPAA compliance, the Carrot Health team customizes workbooks for each customer, a process that had been manual and cumbersome. With so many data sources, calculations, and parameters across different customers, sometimes workbooks got out of sync, increasing the risks of deploying incorrect or outdated content to end consumers. Today, Carrot Health has enabled new levels of parameterization and control over workbooks, actually transforming them during the migration. \"Tableau Advanced Management and Content Migration Tool are the foundation and building blocks for allowing us to move to a more DevOps type of environment for Tableau workbooks,\u201d shared Alex Sweet, Senior Director of Product Development. \u201cWe're at the point where we're not just throwing more people at problems\u2014we\u2019re able to be smarter about how we solve those problems from technology and design standpoints using Tableau.\" With the help of the data engineering team, Alex and his product engineers standardized code bases and data architecture behind the scenes, and adopted a thoughtful approach to workbook template design. This has made it easier to dynamically set different defaults and swap out values in workbooks for different customers during the migration. Carrot Health is not only scaling templates across more customers, but has improved their prototyping process, delivering new analytics functionality and modules to customers faster than before. As their SaaS offerings continue to grow, Candace and Alex plan to take advantage of other Advanced Management for Tableau Server features, such as the Resource Monitoring Tool, which provides agent-based cluster monitoring and session-level user data. The development team runs a lot of extracts, and this will help Alex better track the performance of the jobs and the system. Carrot Health also plans to use the Advanced Management for Tableau Server configuration features to help scale automated testing frameworks, plan for multi-node deployments, and eventually offload some services into Amazon Web Services for more efficiency and scalability."

The company strives to create value for employees, and in response to COVID-19, it has taken a structured approach to protect their wellbeing. Tableau is an integral part of this approach and is used to monitor and respond to employee needs on a daily basis. The company\u2019s overall response to COVID-19 includes three main pillars of activity: awareness creation; employee wellbeing; and business continuity. The biggest challenge, however, was to ensure the safety and wellbeing of over 14,000 employees spread across more than 130 locations pan India. Leading this is a task force headed up by TVS Credit\u2019s most senior leaders, and they have set up a sub-task force dedicated to the needs of the employees. With the help of Tableau, the requirements of the geographically dispersed employees could be centrally tracked and monitored on a continuous basis. As one of its first priorities, this sub-task force set up a dashboard in Tableau to visualise information related to the health and safety of employees. Refreshed daily with information collected from employees, regional and area supervisors, the dashboard helps TVS Credit to assess employee needs across several categories, including the health of employees and family members and any requirements for finance, medicine, food or transport. Immediately upon launching the dashboard, TVS Credit identified over 100 employees with urgent medical emergencies and was able to formulate a quick scheme to help and provide financial support where needed. Since that time, they have continued to track and resolve employee needs, and the number of those requiring support has steadily come down. In addition, regional and area supervisors have been equipped to resolve most issues themselves so that the task force can focus on those which are critical.\nTVS Credit believes in the power of data as it enables quick decision making in times of crisis. The company relied on the clear and structured visual interface of Tableau, which gave a snapshot of employee needs and helped them respond to those in a swift manner. TVS Credit\u2019s structured approach towards addressing employee needs at this time has reaffirmed its commitment to being an employee-first organisation, and employees have responded by saying that they feel cared for and are proud to be part of the organisation. Adding to this, TVS Credit is now supporting the employees with additional training so that they can use some of this time working from home to focus on upskilling and developing their careers. Weekly dashboards help them to stay on track by monitoring their status and completion."

As with many businesses, mitigating operational and product life cycle risks at USAA is essential to maintaining efficiency, member satisfaction, and growth. Risk analysts use data from multiple systems\u2014including issue management, gaps analysis, operational assessments, customer relationship management, business intelligence services, and EGRC (enterprise governance, risk management, and compliance)\u2014to help ensure that USAA is meeting its key performance metrics. But having data in multiple places was a risk in itself, and the process USAA used for sorting data and building reports varied from person to person and team to team. If reports were created using different data filters, or data that was pulled at different points in time, the findings varied\u2014leading to contradictory or misconstrued results. These inconsistencies were problematic for decision makers, including executives, boards of directors, partners, and federal governing agencies. Further down in the organization, it was also difficult for business team leaders and individual workers to make timely, informed decisions. Using Tableau, USAA can now connect to all of their data sources and create dashboards and visualizations based on this newly centralized data hub. Tableau enables USAA data workers to quickly build reports for internal and external stakeholders, either by exporting visualizations to Microsoft PowerPoint for executive audiences, or by publishing links in Tableau for other analysts and first-line users. Drawing the data from a unified, \u201csingle source of truth\u201d helps USAA maintain consistency and accuracy across all reports. Speed and agility of information sharing have also improved dramatically. By unifying data and streamlining reporting with Tableau, analysts can now prepare reports in seconds, where previous processes could take up to one month and not be as consistent or accurate. Workers at all levels of the organization can now make faster, better decisions, and feel more confident that the data they're using is the right data. With Tableau, USAA has begun building a data-driven culture throughout its workforce and partner ecosystem. Now, every individual and team is using data to build success across the organization."

Five years ago, disparate systems made it difficult to get a holistic view of their data and technology that needed updating. This made it challenging to engage and report to more staff without added cost and to track the accuracy of loan applications and financial transactions for its 100,000+ members. They embarked on a journey - first, to upgrade technology and build a data warehouse to store all data in one place. With an emphasis on becoming a more data-driven company, they began replacing manual reports with Tableau dashboards. After successfully moving from on-premise to the cloud with Amazon Web Services (AWS), St. Mary\u2019s Bank scaled Tableau as its enterprise analytics solution. Today, with Tableau\u2019s native connection to AWS and data sources like Snowflake, St. Mary\u2019s Bank performs fast, reliable, and cost-effective analysis on customer assets totaling more than $1 billion. Today, nearly 70% of staff use Tableau to gather insights on branch operations and make data-driven decisions that improve customer service, asset management, and operations performance. With all data consolidated in AWS, the Business Analytics and Project Management team, with the help of Arkatechture, also introduced a rules engine on top of AWS, which expedited data cleansing and helped maintain regulatory compliance. Data quality is tracked in Tableau for business teams to view on-demand each morning, and so far, nearly 40,000 data errors have been resolved with a weekly savings of 10 to 20 hours. St. Mary\u2019s also monitors volunteerism, a strategic company goal, with Tableau as well.

Its 50,000 colleagues in 120 countries drive results for clients by using proprietary data and analytics to deliver insights that reduce risk and improve performance. Aon\u2019s Center for Innovation and Analytics (ACIA) \u2013 part of the firm\u2019s Data & Analytic Services team \u2013 began using Tableau in 2014 to bolster analytical capabilities throughout the company. The goal was to cut time to insight and enable employees all over the world to better serve their own analytical needs. Today, Tableau is powering a number of Aon\u2019s flagship platforms including the Risk/View, an embedded data analytics service that brings thousands of people closer to their data. Aon thrives on its ability to deliver fast, accurate data analytics to colleagues and clients alike, enabling people to make better decisions and improve business. As part of this, Aon founded the ACIA in 2009, with a focus on improving data management, reporting and analytics throughout the company. However, the analytics tools in place at that time were not able to deliver the kind of high-quality insights the ACIA wanted, in the timescale required. \u201cWe were relying on a patchwork of tools including SQL, Chronos, BBA and Excel,\u201d states Giuseppe Tortorici, BI and Visualization Manager at Aon\u2019s ACIA. \u201cWhile all of these were perfectly capable, they took a lot of skill and time to work with, plus they lacked the visual analytics aspects we were looking for.\u201d In 2014, Aon replaced its disparate analytics tools with Tableau, meaning that for the first time ever, ACIA analysts could work from one central analytics platform. It wasn\u2019t long before the ACIA saw an impact. \u201cStraight away we were able to combine insights much better and use visualizations to bring data to life,\u201d says Giuseppe. \u201cTableau\u2019s intuitive drag and drop interface also made analytics much faster, significantly cutting time to insight. New visualizations could be created from scratch in a matter of minutes, while creating full dashboards took just a day.\u201d Tableau\u2019s ease of use and rich visual analytics capabilities quickly sparked curiosity beyond the ACIA team, to the wider company. \u201cWe had an increasing number of business units coming to us, asking how they could use Tableau for their own analytics needs,\u201d adds Giuseppe. \u201cRecognizing the potential, we began running Tableau training sessions and within a short period of time, had built a passionate Tableau community inside Aon.\u201d Giuseppe now mentors and assists Aon business units all over the world with their own Tableau training, creating comprehensive best practice guides they can use to organically drive uptake throughout the company. \u201cAll new dashboards are shared and peer-reviewed by the community before going to publication, which keeps the standard really high,\u201d says Giuseppe. \u201cThe level of interest in analytics has never been stronger, even for a company that revolves around data.\u201d In 2015, Aon chose Tableau to power its flagship Risk/View embedded portal, which provides thousands of insurance professionals with data-driven insights that help them accurately assess prospective customers. After a successful trial in Australia in 2016, Risk/View was rolled out across Canada, North America and the EMEA region. \u201c90 percent of the content published in Risk/View is created in Tableau,\u201d says Giuseppe. \u201cWith just a handful of dashboards we can give colleagues and carriers all the information they need to the make fast, informed decisions.\u201d A major factor in the choice to use Tableau was its intuitive user interface (UI). \u201cNew analysts can be trained very easily, which is important,\u201d notes Giuseppe. \u201cMany of them comment that Tableau is easy to pick up and learn, but also goes extremely deep where necessary, which they love.\u201d Development and delivery times are also very short, meaning information in Risk/View is always up to date; a key requirement for accurate decision making. Aon uses Alteryx to prep a wide range of systematic and non-systematic data sources before visualizing everything in Tableau. Alteryx has also been used to automate many manual analytics processes, cutting down on repetition and saving time. \u201cWith Tableau and Alteryx, we can develop new content in a fraction of the time it would take in something like JavaScript,\u201d comments Giuseppe. \u201cIn many cases, the process has gone from weeks to hours, meaning anyone looking in Risk/View knows they can always trust the data they\u2019re looking at.\u201d Tableau\u2019s embedded analytics functionality also helps maintain consistency across all of Risk/View, as well as other externally facing portals. \u201cWhen dashboards are in production, a link is created to Tableau Server, which embeds them to both colleagues and carriers via Aon\u2019s portal,\u201d says Giuseppe. \u201cThis creates a very professional look and feel across all of our materials and content.\u201d \u201cWe have internal guidelines governing key areas like fonts and color palettes and have also created a number of templates within Tableau, which helps ensure consistency,\u201d continues Giuseppe. \u201cMany of our external stakeholders don\u2019t even realize they are using Tableau!\u201d"

        "company": "Wellcome",
        "content": "Wellcome is a London-based politically and financially independent foundation. Established in 1936, the Foundation supports research projects and initiatives to promote human health. All Wellcome\u2019s work is funded from an investment portfolio that currently stands at \u00a326.8 billion. In the next five years, Wellcome plans to spend around \u00a35 billion helping people around the world explore great ideas. The Foundation is creating a thriving data culture. For example, grant portfolio managers recognise the value of data as a strategic asset, using it to help allocate funds to the right projects at the right time. Wellcome is also encouraging stronger data skills amongst staff in order to better understand what projects they are currently funding, and predict future funding. A key area of responsibly at Wellcome is the allocation of funds for research and innovation development in the health sector. The Foundation\u2019s portfolio managers aim to invest approximately \u00a31 billion annually in selected projects. The Foundation\u2019s Grant Tracker application is at the heart of grant management. It enables the processing of applications, the management of ongoing projects and everything in between. Data engineers in Wellcome Data Labs use Alteryx to bring diverse data into a data warehouse and combine it with information from other sources, such as associated publications or details about researchers. Publicly accessible data, including policy data from the World Health Organisation, is scraped and searched for Wellcome mentions, using pattern recognition and Machine Learning. According to Natalie Leach, Senior Tableau Analyst at Wellcome, the Grant Tracker is popular with employees \u2013 but one important challenge is the inability to see the bigger picture. \u201cPeople can use the Grant Tracker to process applications, view different grants. However, it doesn\u2019t provide a clear, aggregated view of the research portfolio \u2013 the status of individual research programs and their performance. That\u2019s what was really missing before we introduced Tableau and our data warehouse,\u201d she says. In 2017 Wellcome began a journey to modernise its analytics capabilities. It built a new data warehouse, engineered for self-service analytics. It standardised on Tableau Server as the analysis layer of its data warehouse, with approximately 200 employees regularly accessing the system. \u201cTime and again, people come up to me and say they are seeing insights that were not there before. This has been really, really useful for people.\u201d The way people use data is changing too - it\u2019s smarter, faster and significantly more rewarding. Natalie explains, \u201cAt the end of every month, one of the data analysts in the grants team would run these SQL queries, and then send out emails to people. That absorbed so much of everyone\u2019s time. Using Tableau, the grants team can now just self-serve. At any time during the month, they can keep an eye on the data, drill into any anomalies, and discover new insights. That wasn\u2019t possible before.\u201d The Foundation\u2019s portfolio managers traditionally managed their individual funding projects, engaging regularly with researchers. However, key insights were often missing. Managers often lacked a holistic view of how much money was spent on which funding area and there was often difficultly understanding which projects were successful. Wellcome doesn\u2019t judge success on financial return on investment, but on the positive impact on human health \u2013 which can be difficult to measure. The problem was particularly acute in the area of innovation - where researchers were being funded to develop potentially life-changing products, such as vaccines or prostheses. To support a new strategy for their Innovations division, Wellcome needed to do a deeper analysis of the projects in order to understand which ones were most likely to generate a positive outcome. As an example, Natalie points to the work done on the serious tropical disease Leishmaniasis to highlight the value Tableau is bringing to portfolio managers. \u201cTableau is transforming the way Wellcome analyses projects treating diseases like Leishmaniasis,\u201d she says. \u201cOur portfolio managers in Innovations can see all the grants attributable to the disease and how the research is progressing. They can make informed judgements on how to move the project forward and understand more about the status of things like clinical trials. None of this was visible before. Now, the team can simply open up a dashboard and the insights are there.\u201d Wellcome is also using the data-driven insights to understand how the Foundation itself is performing. The Insight & Analysis team assesses the impact of Wellcome funded projects by a variety of measures and strategic objectives, to find ways to increase Wellcome\u2019s impact and inform future strategy. \u201cThe team are now able to assess in which areas of human health Wellcome is having most impact,\u201d says Natalie. Transparency is of course important to Wellcome. One of the most important steps toward that transparency is empowering people to understand what data is available, where it is located \u2013 and then making that data visual and accessible. Natalie explains: \u201cTransparency is something that we\u2019re always talking about at Wellcome. Not just in terms of data, but just in terms of the way that we function. Tableau is definitely feeding into that, and will do more in the future. We\u2019re working on a project at the moment to put dashboards on our website so that anyone from the public can come and interrogate the data themselves.\u201d"

        "company": "Swiss Life ",
        "content": "With operations in France dating back more than 110 years, Swiss Life is a leader in the insurance and asset management industries. The group chose Tableau in order to provide its teams with high-performance and cross-functional dashboards. Implementing an internal data culture allows Swiss Life to place data at the heart of its performance, thereby becoming a data-driven company that is better able to ensure innovation in its practices and identify business opportunities. Swiss Life needed to streamline its data visualization solutions. Three of these were already deployed within the group. Yet they gave rise to issues related to homogeneity and reliability of results, forcing IT to multiply their feeds and analysts to rely on different data sources. The system was therefore technologically complex and costly. The deployment is progressing continuously today. Swiss Life chose to rely on data sources that were already structured in order to be successful and to avoid having to tap into heterogeneous data that requires multiple connectors. In reality, the data displayed could only be effective if the sources were clear right from the start. Data marts containing all of the data to be used from more than 100 different sources were therefore either constructed or enriched upstream. A team was set up to manage and publish the indicators for implementation of the main project dedicated to customer relations. This team proved to be a guarantee of data reliability. It still remains the first point of contact today for all teams in this area who use Tableau within Swiss Life. It all started in 2017 with a study carried out on the decision-making architecture within Swiss Life. The aim of this was to determine the best data visualization tool that allows data analysts to create dynamic and tailor-made dashboards. The study recommended opting for Tableau following a competitive bid process involving several stakeholders. The experts were of the opinion that this solution represented the most innovative tool, both from an analytical point of view and in terms of the user experience. So, the first Tableau license was purchased by Swiss Life at the end of 2017 with support from Actinvision, which played a role in integrating the solution. As a Tableau partner for several years, Actinvision was selected to support the teams with cultural adaptation of the solution and to help the analysts become familiar with the software. Each employee had previously had their own tool to manage. The Tableau solution means that managers and analysts now have common indicators available. Managers have the benefit of a comprehensive overview which allows them to distribute work and manage their specific activities more effectively. Tableau in particular allows them to customize their dashboards and carry out their own analyses based on their own data. The analysts have a detailed view available that gives them access to substantial amounts of data. This means that they can construct dashboards that the managers are then able to access. A total of 225 dashboards have been created that can be viewed by employees at any time, and which provide as many as 1,630 different views. This new approach has resulted in undeniable efficiency and productivity savings. Swiss Life has trained more than 200 users since 2018, with this figure set to rise to 300 by the end of 2020. The company continues to work hand in hand with Tableau and Actinvision with the aim of increasing use of the solution within the company. More than 10 days of training have taken place in one year with contributions from Tableau and Actinvision experts aimed at highlighting specific usage cases. The support provided by Actinvision promoted a cross-functional approach, thus engaging a wide range of employees. This selection ensured that confidence was generated, which is essential in assisting with cultural adaptation and the use of common indicators. Another crucial input was that Swiss Life began to pursue a change management process aimed at developing a data culture with Actinvision\u2019s support. This process is based on the approaches common to the methodology of Tableau Blueprint. Specifically, it enabled internal communities to be put in place centered around data. Swiss Life is thus progressing towards becoming a data-driven company, i.e., an organization that places data at the heart of its growth strategy. Swiss Life has managed to create an internal community by implementing:\n- \u201cDashboard Shows\u201d: community-based events where users get together each quarter to share tips and to learn about other usage cases;\n- newsletters published every two months with advice to analysts, useful links for specific user profiles, and information for the internal community on progress regarding analytical uses."

        "content": "Rugby Australia is the sport's national governing body in Australia. The organization\u2019s vision is to inspire all Australians to enjoy the great global game of rugby and, with the help of Tableau, data is driving its success more than ever. Rugby Australia initially adopted Tableau to bring together the vast amounts of data used to analyze and predict how its teams will perform against others, taking into account details like player health, training and past performance. With all this information in one place, coaches can analyze information 10x faster and detect new insights to improve performance. These benefits are set to multiply as Rugby Australia uses Tableau Blueprint to drive a data-driven culture across the entire organization. In the short-term, this will involve extending Tableau to 100 users, including Super Rugby franchises and member unions.                               For the coaches of Rugby Australia\u2019s high-performance teams like the Wallabies and Wallaroos, using data to drive results is nothing new. From player health and training data through to stats on competitors and referees, every data point has the potential to unlock performance gains. The difficulty for coaches was taking all of this data which was handed over to them in separate reports, and understanding what was most important\u2014without sacrificing time with players out on the field. With the help of the data analyst team, coaches can now see a centralized view of player data in Tableau, bringing in data from strength and conditioning coaches, as well as sports doctors and physiotherapists. \u201cWith Tableau, we were able to break down the barriers to using our data and get insights 10x faster,\u201d said Cathal Garvey, Head of Analytics at Rugby Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re also uncovering things that may have been missed before because it was too difficult to detect the right signals from all the noise.\u201d                               Coaches have been quick to embrace Tableau and are now in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes analyzing data. The next step for Rugby Australia is to take this data culture and embed it across the rest of the organization, starting at the grassroots with community rugby. One of the key goals is to understand trends like demographics and the popularity of rugby across regions by using data like ticket sales and participation stats from local clubs. These insights will help Rugby Australia to connect to new fans and players, and grow participation. Garvey said that demand for analytics is high across the organization with people wanting to make fact-based decisions. The important thing is establishing the right capabilities to meet this demand, which is why Rugby Australia is using Tableau Blueprint, Tableau\u2019s step-by-step guide to creating a data culture, and taking a structured approach to scaling its use of data. \u201cTableau Blueprint provides a great framework for understanding the organization\u2019s needs and building a data solution that can be scaled across different departments,\u201d said Garvey. \u201cUltimately this will help everyone be more data-informed in their role and improve our great game at all levels both on and off the field.\u201d"

The company uses Tableau to help business units throughout the organisation gain deep insights from their data \u2013 all in compliance with stringent data protection regulations. In addition to supporting other areas, E.ON uses Tableau to monitor the status of hundreds of sensors on each Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system, by visualising and analysing deep learning algorithms that determine their health and state. Similarly, their Grid system monitors tens of thousands of network components within one single map. These visual, unified insights into critical energy systems underpins the company\u2019s predictive maintenance strategy and ensures they operate at optimal performance. As one of the largest energy supply companies in Germany, E.ON manages a vast network of Combined Heat and Power plant sensors, cables and grid components. Regular, proactive monitoring and maintenance of this complex network plays a vital role in improving performance \u2013 and ensuring customers continue to receive a reliable and rewarding service experience. Previously, a reliance on outdated reporting processes was making it increasingly difficult for E.ON to efficiently plan and manage predictive maintenance across these networks. E.ON introduced Tableau to help the organisation take system monitoring and predictive maintenance into the future. Alexander Schaaf, Visual Analytics Engineer at E.ON, says: \u201cOne of my first tasks was to help colleagues visualise the grid system of cables and substations, using shapes and colour to help them see at a glance which assets required priority maintenance,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe can now visualise and prioritise 70,000 assets on one easy-to-use map.\u201d To simplify the complex monitoring of the many sensors, Alexander\u2019s advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) team developed an algorithm that maps the value of the sensors to a single \u2018health index\u2019 that is very easy to monitor. Alexander explains: \u201cWe are using this with Tableau, combined and embedded into a web page. Operators no longer sit in a control room staring at 20 screens \u2013 they can monitor everything in a unified, live visual environment. Colleagues outside of the power plant can also monitor the turbines by picking up their iPad and examining the health index.\u201d Other areas at E.ON are also already using Tableau; around 15 business units use the Tableau Server, while hundreds of employees use Tableau Desktop to create new dashboards and analyses."

        "content": "Neowiz services have over 80 games around the world, with ten to hundreds of thousands of daily active users (DAUs) for each game. In the process, they were faced with the challenge of collecting various types of original data quickly and integrating & analyzing the data which continues to grow at staggering rates. \u201cWith Tableau, we were able to measure our business performance accurately, validate the hypotheses of our business analysts, marketers, and game planners with data, measure the marketing performance, and predict the customer lifetime value,\u201d said Robert Kim, the director of the Information Analysis Office at Neowiz. \u201cIn the process of implementing a self-service Business Intelligence (BI), our staff were able to broaden their thinking when they were exploring the business data. In addition to the analysts at the information analysis office, frontline employees moved away from Excel and gained insights from the data. Less time was spent preparing the data and more time analyzing it.\u201d The Information Analysis Team at Neowiz wanted to reduce the number of resources used in implementing the report and help their employees to focus more on analysis. The former BI tools they had used were difficult to use and took a lot of time to develop visualized reports. Most of the analysis tasks had to be performed by the Information Analysis Team; the schema management was not flexible; the development process was dependent on the internal IT team. To address the issue, Neowiz Information Analysis Team needed self-service BI solution with which they can connect, integrate and share data easily. They had adopted Tableau as it offered superior visual analytics functions, it was easy to share data and visualizations to others. After adopting Tableau, Neowiz created an environment where not only experts but also general users can build games and business-related reports easily. Connecting to various data warehouses both on-premise and in the cloud, users could visualize and analyze data without coding, and draw insights instantaneously. In addition, when connecting to powerful analytics tools such as R or Python, Tableau enables Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through simple clicks and drag and drop. As a result, Neowiz was able to reduce report implementation and sharing time by 50 percent, in comparison to the old analytics tool they used. Tableau also offered executives with visualized dashboards, not reports in a grid format, which helped them easy to understand the business status at a glance. These changes improved executives\u2019 satisfaction in report and stakeholders could make better decisions with daily insight uncovered by Tableau. Neowiz uses Tableau to create and publish reports for their enterprise-wide BI portal. When they began searching for a new reporting solution including Tableau, the company focused on reviewing enterprise-wide sharing functions as their top of mind. They had verified several facts such as the tool should provide enterprise-level data security and permission management; it should be freely connected to mobile app SDKs, Google Play Store data, and data collected from crawling as well as game service platform database. The UI should be user-friendly; and it should provide sufficient online learning resources. In September 2018 when they first started using Tableau Desktop, it was mainly used by the Information Analysis Team. However within a year, most of the employees across the entire organization including the game business team were using Tableau for data analysis. Due to growing interest of Tableau internally , Information Analysis Team members who are leading to build dashboards at Neowiz started to provide internal training sessions on Tableau regularly. Now Tableau has become the most important platform for sharing visual analysis of data mining results. In the past, Neowiz produced many reports using Excel, which could only be shared among a limited number of people. With Tableau, Neowiz employees are sharing insights and collaborating on the web. On the web portal with embedded Tableau, any users with permission can access the dashboards and teams can work together to make changes in central place. Employees who had previously preferred to prepare reports using Excel found the change to Tableau made it easier for them to analyze and visualize data. They are now actively participating in learning and using Tableau. \u201cSuccessful games are loved by users for many years, but many games don\u2019t make it and disappear within several months after they are launched. Considering the nature of the gaming industry, it is essential to rapidly analyze data and implement reports promptly to assist in decision-making,\u201d said Robert Kim. \u201cBeing able to implement reports easily and present them to internal stakeholders using Tableau can be a game-changer for the gaming company.\u201d Tableau allowed the data-driven decision-making to expand from the management to frontline employees. Employees in business and marketing teams were able to develop their ideas and gain insights while exploring the data by themselves. Before adopting Tableau at Neowiz, reports were shared and consumed within a specific team. But with Tableau in place, all the team members who develop and support a game can easily generate and share the results of analysis. The sharing of insights based on data enabled the teams to begin the discussion with a common understanding of the situation. This improved the collaboration among different teams dramatically.\u201d As the number of workers using Tableau to analyze data and generate reports increases, an increasing number of workers have become interested in data analytics and report implementation with Tableau. Initially, Tableau was implemented on a small scale, but the number of users has steadily increased. As a result, Neowiz has been providing its own Tableau training on a regular basis and running an active community for Tableau users. As each team creates and shares various analytics use cases, team members who use Tableau are improving their analytical reasoning and related skills. Neowiz expects that this will further reinforce its culture of data-driven decision making. Neowiz (CEO: Mun, Ji-su) was established in April 2007 to develop and service competitive games as a spinoff of Neowiz Holdings. The company is focusing on penetrating overseas markets with outstanding in-house IPs and servicing online and mobile games in various genres. Neowiz\u2019s mobile game \u201cBrowndust\u201d is a big hit and is serviced globally. The company\u2019s new console game \u2018Bless Unleashed\u2019 will be soon launched in the North American and European markets."

Using Tableau Cloud, the district created dashboards that for the first time show critical student data\u2014including data about diagnostics, formative assessment performance, and competence in various disciplines\u2014all in a consolidated, easily filtered format. Teachers and administrators interact with the dashboards to see academic and behavioral characteristics of each individual student at a glance, helping them track key performance indicators and drive focused, intentional intervention discussions on a student-by-student basis. The dashboards, along with Tableau-based personalized learning profiles that provide self-reported data about each student's interests, skills, and learning preferences, have transformed the way Marysville Schools achieves better student equity. The holistic view of relevant data tells a story about each student that teachers and other staff can immediately use to plan and evaluate intervention strategies. In addition to empowering teachers and improving morale, the new dashboard-driven workflows also save the district time and money. By more accurately identifying at-risk students, administrators were able to effectively allocate resources and meet student needs with a more personalized, yet precise multi-tier approach. Through these efforts, the district has dramatically reduced its dependence on state and federal funds. Per-student intervention expenses have decreased by more than 50% from approximately $10,000 to $4,400 per student, and the projected savings from reduced special education requirements is between $6 million and $18 million over 25 years. Marysville Schools has also seen measurable gains in academic assessment performance in the four years since it began its data literacy journey, including a lift from 71% to 81% passing scores on third-grade year-end standardized language arts assessments. It's also one of the few Ohio districts to score a hard-won B on its statewide K-3 literacy report card two years in a row. The district largely attributes this success to Tableau as well."

Tableau enables Tesco to unlock important insights that help them deliver impactful L&D programmes for employees and the business. It\u2019s estimated that more than \u00a340 billion is spent on training in the United Kingdom, making it a significant area of investment for many organisations. However, employee development is notoriously difficult to quantify and, without the right tools in place, Tesco found it challenging to accurately understand what kind of return it was making on its investment. \u201cTesco takes employee development very seriously and is extremely proud of its L&D programme,\u201d says Derek Mitchell, Insight and Analytics Manager at Tesco\u2019s Customer Engagement Centre, in the UK. \u201cBut prior to using Tableau, it was almost impossible to really understand how that investment was affecting key areas such as employee efficiency, or satisfaction over the long term.\u201d When Derek joined the business in 2019, Tableau was already in use at its Dundee campus, but not to its full potential. \u201cEmployees were analysing single Excel files in Tableau, but there was no consolidation of data sources or advanced functionality in use,\u201d says Derek. \u201cAdditionally, a lot of L&D data was stored across multiple disparate sources, making it very hard to analyse in a comprehensive manner.\u201d Derek\u2019s team began by consolidating all three major L&D data sources \u2013 performance data in SQL Server, attendee feedback in Microsoft Forms, and L&D sentiment in Excel \u2013 together in Tableau, replacing 74 individual data charts with one single source of truth. His team then combined key information from those data sets together for the first time in a dedicated dashboard, revealing three key areas where ROI could be tangibly demonstrated to the senior leadership team. These areas included: learner sentiment towards the training experience, learner confidence in the topic, and learner performance against KPI\u2019s post-training. \u201cBy comparing attendee feedback from Microsoft Forms against performance data in SQL Server, we started seeing some interesting patterns,\u201d says Derek. \u201cFor instance, we were able to see for the first time that simply looking at whether attendees enjoyed an experience was no predictor of a shift in performance post-training.\u201d \u201cWithout Tableau, important insights like this would still be going undiscovered, buried in spreadsheets and forms spread across the business,\u201d continues Derek. \u201cNow we can use them to create tangible links between the training we are providing and the improvements in everyday employee performance, which is invaluable.\u201d Using Tableau, Tesco can proactively track the L&D needs of employees right down to an individual level. \u201cBy importing all performance and learning data into Tableau and visualising the two together, we can see individual employee performance across a wide range of business areas,\u201d says Derek. \u201cThen we can analyse this against which L&D courses they have attended recently, which not only tells us if additional training may be required, but also which existing courses are the most effective and which need further refinement.\u201d At Tesco, they are using Tableau to analyse written feedback from training course attendees, uncovering key insights that were otherwise nearly impossible to spot. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to quantify written comments using conventional tools. So much of the post-course attendee feedback of this nature was simply stored in an Excel file where little had been done with it,\u201d explains Derek. \u201cUsing Tableau, we were able to parse out all the comments into individual words, then visualise them in word clouds using a sentiment engine.\u201d \u201cWhen we looked at the word clouds, we found that 25 percent of all negative comments were about the temperature of the room during the course, while a further 13 percent were about problems with system access from those trying to attend courses remotely,\u201d adds Derek. \u201cThese are the kinds of insights we\u2019d never have realised without the visual analysis Tableau lets us do. But armed with this knowledge, we can quickly eradicate some of the biggest pain points for attendees in just a few simple steps.\u201d Before Tableau, Tesco employed two full-time staff members dedicated exclusively to producing Excel reports on L&D activity. Now, nearly all reporting is automated in Tableau, saving thousands of hours annually and allowing Tesco\u2019s L&D experts to focus on effective training and improving content, rather than time-consuming manual reporting tasks. \u201cAs soon as somebody submits a piece of L&D feedback on a standardised form, it gets pulled into Tableau where it\u2019s joined up with all their performance data for the four weeks pre-learning and four weeks post-learning,\u201d says Derek. \u201cFrom there it\u2019s automatically compared against their peers, helping us to proactively track their L&D needs.\u201d As part of this automation process, Tesco has decreased the number of questions asked to train course attendees, improving the overall feedback response rate. \u201cPreviously we would ask course attendees 28 separate questions, which led to a high dropout rate,\u201d says Derek. \u201cNow, we ask everyone the same five questions, reducing effort by 80 percent. The result is a much higher response rate, giving us a richer, more consistent data set that we can analyse in Tableau and use to improve future L&D offerings.\u201d The impact Tableau has made on Tesco\u2019s L&D efforts within such a short amount of time has not gone unnoticed to other areas of the organisation. Benefits of flexibility, ease-of-use and scalability have made Tableau integral to making data-driven decisions, with an impact reaching beyond L&D. \u201cPeople see how easy Tableau makes it to understand complex data sets and they soon want to know how they can apply it to their own business areas,\u201d explains Derek."

        "company": "Siemens AG",
        "content": "Siemens AG is a global technology powerhouse that has stood for engineering excellence, innovation, quality, reliability and internationality for more than 170 years. The company is active around the globe, focusing on the areas of power generation and distribution, intelligent infrastructure for buildings and distributed energy systems, and automation and digitalization in the process and manufacturing industries. In fiscal 2019 (ending September 30, 2019) Siemens generated revenue of \u20ac86.8 billion and net income of \u20ac5.6 billion. At the end of September 2019, the company had around 385,000 employees worldwide. Tableau supports Siemens IT to analyze and harness data. Insights are available on demand, which previously consumed a lot of the IT Controlling team\u2019s time and resources. Trusted data and drill-down capabilities support numerous teams for data-driven decision making, accessible across multiple devices within Siemens. Visual analytics has enabled Siemens businesses to improve operational efficiencies and streamline internal processes. With Tableau in place, Siemens IT is able to create management reports and better explain its IT data. Ilya Kovalenko, Data Analyst at Siemens, shares, \u201cSometimes in the past we used Excel and PowerPoint for our reporting. We spent time downloading files and there were issues with version control. It\u2019s also very hard to drill-down in Excel. When someone raised a question, we had to go back and do the calculation \u2013 and by the time we replied the data was often out of date.\u201d \u201cI downloaded the free trial [of Tableau] to get some experience. Within a very short time, I delivered an analysis that the team had spent weeks working on.\u201d The use of Tableau has subsequently spread quickly through Siemens. A new service called \u201cIntegrated Reporting and Analytic Metrics (iRAM)\u201d has been established, providing secure access to more than 15,000 report views for Siemens employees. More than 200 data sources were combined, delivering more than 7 billion asset rows organized by easily accessible topic families. \u201cIn our function alone, we have more than 2,000 active users.\u201d says Ilya. \u201cWe use Tableau Desktop for development. Tableau Server gives our users secure access to information and dashboards directly in their browser.\u201d One of the first Tableau projects for Ilya and his team was to examine IT usage and costs in Siemens IT infrastructure. \u201cThe visual analytics were so well received, that I was invited to work in Germany and help establish similar visualizations for global analysis.\u201d Tableau is having a similar impact on the ServiceNow digital IT assets workflow platform. Multiple Siemens units use ServiceNow to provide a seamless user experience across multiple providers, from ordering IT services to lifecycle management for IT products. \u201cWe use ServiceNow to bring together all the data from our IT providers, manage orders, create tickets and adjust services,\u201d explains Ilya. \u201cThanks to Tableau we now have better transparency into our IT costs and consumption. For example, we can see who consumes which IT service and their location; plus we can drill down by geographical level, divisional level, or organizational level.\u201d This insight into the cost of IT services is especially valuable to Siemens\u2019 finance department. From the consumption reports, they can see exactly which department is consuming which services in which geography. The information is used to support budget forecasts and plan future IT expenditure and services. In addition to gaining new insights, Tableau is also saving a significant amount of time. For Ilya, one particular example stands out. \u201cOne team was frustrated by the reliance on standard software for analysis. They would download and extract the data, then rework it and send the information in Excel. We quickly automated this process in Tableau, and the team asked us what they were supposed to do with the half day they\u2019d saved! We literally saved them half a day every week and they are still using this report after two years.\u201d Ilya\u2019s team uses Tableau to quickly reach the root of IT problems. For example, they can analyze users\u2019 tickets against the complaint and search for recurring patterns. They can then identify where complaints are occurring \u2013 whether it\u2019s a network issue, a specific IT service or a complicated user interface \u2013 and take the necessary steps to solve the problem. Ilya underlines the transformative impact of Tableau, \u201cWe use Circuit, a real-time collaboration software provided by Atos/Unify. When we deployed this tool, we needed to gather user feedback, so we implemented a one-to-five star-based rating. After every call, the users receives a popup window asking them to rate the voice quality.\u201d Ilya was surprised to be confronted with a complaint during a visit abroad. \u201cI was talking with a regional Head of IT and he mentioned that a lot of users were not happy with Circuit. I asked him how he knew that, and he said, \u2018I heard some rumors in the kitchen; employees were complaining\u2019. I replied saying, \u2018Let\u2019s open the rating report and see what people are really thinking\u2019. We studied the report live in Tableau and saw feedback from 10,000 users with an average score of 4.4, which is very high.\u201d False impressions \u2013 based on hearsay \u2013 are immediately corrected using accurate, up-to-date data insights. \u201cThis validates the power of Tableau: we can display trusted insights and answer questions using any device immediately,\u201d Ilya concludes.

        "content": "Region Midtjylland (Region Midt) is responsible for healthcare in the central region of Denmark, providing medical services in support of over 1.3 million citizens across six hospitals. Region Midt relies on Tableau to create a unified self-service analytics solution spanning more than 2,500 employees. One of the initial project successes concerned antibiotics treatment; by exploring data in new ways, Region Midt has reduced drugs wastage and by consequence lowered medicine costs. Tableau is also helping to promote a forward-thinking, data-driven culture. Data is adding clarity and consensus to decisions made by Region Midt clinicians, administrators and managers. This evidence-based approach is empowering users, connecting care and improving the patient experience. Region Midt faced a difficult and urgent challenge: to make sense of the different data locked away in data warehouses, spreadsheets and other systems. \u201cWe had data everywhere \u2013 in warehouses, in Excel, in SAS and in other silos,\u201d explains Jonas Eskildsen S\u00f8rensen, Head of Business Intelligence at Region Midt. \u201cWe simply didn\u2019t have the data insight we needed to run a modern healthcare organisation.\u201d Jonas and his team chose Tableau after analysing multiple solutions on the market, and began to drill down into their data in whole new ways \u2013 starting with drug treatment costs. \u201cIt was almost too easy to drive down medicine costs with Tableau,\u201d says Jonas. \u201cIn the past, we didn\u2019t have as much insight into the distribution of antibiotics. Using Tableau, we are giving clinicians an accurate, timely dashboard of antibiotics administration and patient distribution. This has led to a dramatic reduction in the volume of unnecessary antibiotics given to patients, and by consequence a reduction in drug costs.\u201d Tableau is also helping to reduce the time between patients being referred by their doctor to hospital and the actual appointment. \u201cPreviously, only 60% of patients were seen within 30 days of their referral. Tableau enables us to connect with the relevant patient data, visualise the problem and find answers. Now, 90% of patients have their meeting within 30 days. We are on our way to achieving 100%.\u201d Based on these early wins, Region Midt has standardised on Tableau throughout the organisation, in parallel with a consolidated Microsoft SQL Server data warehouse. \u201cTableau is helping to build Region Midt for the future,\u201d says Jonas. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step forward in the delivery of self-service analytics, because it is so easy to learn. Anyone can become a data rockstar.\u201d More than 2,500 employees now rely on Tableau Server every month. \u201cEvery role in Region Midt uses Tableau,\u201d Jonas comments. \u201cSenior management use it, the clinicians on the floor use it and so does everyone else in-between. Tableau Desktop meanwhile is primarily used by analysts, including ones based in the hospitals.\u201d The results speak for themselves. Jonas continues, \u201cTableau is saving Region Midt a huge amount of time, allowing teams to focus on decision-making, not manual data analysis. In the past, they had their spreadsheets, which they distributed by email. Now the entire process is automated: they can work with the data, present it and distribute it in a much smarter way.\u201d Inspired by the wider Tableau Community, Region Midt has created its own internal Tableau community, establishing a new data culture and training employees to do more with their data. It is encouraging collaboration across teams and driving excitement around data. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to become a data rock star,\u201d says Jonas. \u201cIt\u2019s so much more than just building dashboards. It\u2019s about fueling engagement, it\u2019s about showing people how to use the right tools, encouraging them to use them in the right way. Tableau is a great solution for enabling change.\u201d This new data culture is now emanating from almost every corner of the organisation. It is about replacing the widespread fear of data with a curiosity for information. Jonas concludes, \u201cWe are giving users the opportunity to deep dive into the data. They don\u2019t see it as data. It\u2019s just a smart visualisation, or something they can interact with. It brings forward the curiosity in a lot of people.\u201d"

        "company": "Measured",
        "content": "Brands that spend heavily on their digital marketing campaigns want the best return for their investment\u2014not just increased sales, but also directional visibility on which of their tactics are most effective. With finite resources and an ever-evolving online consumer mindset, it's more important than ever for a brand to spend its marketing dollars wisely. California-based Measured provides analytics to direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands that help each brand understand the efficacy of their advertising spends, in both online channels like Facebook and offline channels like direct mail. Unlike other analytics providers that track static performance factors like last-click and multi-click attribution which have limitations, Measured uses a test and control methodology to inform media incrementality when in the converting path producing transparent, accurate and precise marketing analysis for making better media investment decisions. To bring this incremental analysis to their clients, Measured builds dashboards on Tableau Cloud that can be easily accessed by each client within their Measured experience. These dashboards provide detailed analysis and recommendations for ways each brand can examine paid media performance and optimize their total spend. Measured's cofounders, CEO Trevor Testwuide and CTO Madan Bharadwaj, previously worked at companies that consulted with brands, analyzed their marketing spends, and delivered reports and bespoke UI experiences that were limited in customization and forced users to download data into Excel. The process was effective, but ultimately inefficient. Preparing and querying Excel spreadsheets was a highly manual process, and it was disconnected from the source data, making each report partially out of date as soon as it was finished. And building a separate online data interface for each client to meet their specific needs meant that development slowed down the rate at which each brand client could achieve value with the data. And so Measured was born in 2017, and currently serves timely, insightful data to hundreds of stakeholders at more than twenty-five D2C brands on the incremental contributions of their paid media tactics\u2014all through the familiar and easy-to-use functionality of the Tableau platform. \"Many of our clients in the past have been familiar with Tableau, and would ask if we could give them our insights in the form of workbooks they could use right in their Tableau environments,\" says Testwuide. \"So it just made a lot of sense for us to stop burning our resources building a bespoke, custom UI for every client, when we could accelerate our own application by partnering with Tableau.\" For a startup like Measured, this approach had several key advantages. One of the biggest was time to market\u2014the Measured team rapidly creates new product experiences using the capabilities of the Tableau platform 10 - 20x faster than traditional UI development approaches. In addition, customers can spin up their own bespoke dashboards on top of the Measured dataset within hours without all the disadvantages of \u201cExcel-hell\u201d. In this way, Measured bridges the gap between standard reporting and more specific, business-driven requirements. \"There's always the 80/20 rule,\" Bharadwaj says. \"A standard analytics product experience will cover about 80 percent of a client's use cases, but the remaining 20 percent will be very diverse. And because each of our D2C brand clients has a unique business model, that 20 percent is where they generally spend 80 percent of their time. So, we implement Tableau in ways that extend the customer's product experience to include these more distributed use cases, and that way they get everything they need in one place.\" Capital efficiency was also optimized, in that Measured could focus resources on its core applications rather than building a customized UI for every client. \"Our challenge was to commit to a product experience from within Tableau, which was a radical approach in market for our category\" says Bharadwaj. \u201cBut once we got comfortable with that idea, Tableau brings a lot of what you\u2019d want in a UI product like navigation, objects like worksheets, dashboards, an object hierarchy, events, scripting - all out of the box.\u201d And because its target market had proficiency with Tableau already, Measured could deliver workbooks that easily integrated into each client's workflows without disrupting work or requiring further training. To maximize the value Measured provided to brands, ease of use and stakeholder adoption were an essential focus. Having streamlined its process for developing rich, unique user experiences for its clients, Measured wanted to further improve usability and drive adoption by providing these experiences from within the analytics products the clients were already using. By providing Tableau dashboards that surface the data analytics in ways that look and feel just like the client's preferred toolset, and then supplementing with new applications that facilitate further data entry and manipulation, Measured gives each client a rich experience that maps to what they already know. Getting to this experience, Bharadwaj points out, means putting in the work up front to gain a clear understanding of the client's specific business needs. \"There's probably more than 100 metrics we can derive from a standard data set. What makes a client unique is figuring out the four or five metrics they care about most for their business. Once we know what those are, we can start to build the experience they need.\" This extensibility approach to integrating Tableau with the client's daily experience goes a long way to get people using the Tableau platform and its data as part of their everyday work. Adoption is diverse at Measured's clients, ranging from data scientists and analysts to senior executives and marketing optimization personnel. Each one uses the platform in their own way, for specific business purposes. The flexibility of creating dashboards to meet each stakeholder's needs means each client can maximize the value Tableau adds in their environment. \"The ease of customization we get with Tableau allows us to align our interface with the unique requirements of each customer,\" says Testwuide. \"When we do that, it drives much higher rates of adoption, informs high value decisions with our analytics, and helps the client win with our technology.\" One of Measured's recent success stories is the work they did for Johnny Was, a women's clothing and accessories brand with more than 30 stores across seven US states. With a mandate to grow its ecommerce sales channel by tenfold in five years, it sought Measured's help in identifying the best composition of paid media allocations that would optimally scale its tactics and drive new customer acquisition. Measured worked with the brand to identify the specific analytics queries that would yield solid directional guidance, and then deployed the Measured cross-channel incrementality measurement framework to get a clear picture for the first time of how marketing spend performed in each channel. Using net profit as a primary growth metric, the Measured framework gave Johnny Was a new way to measure the marginal impact on net profit of each tactic, and use this information to plan the best ways to scale, cut, and maintain its investments. In the first 12 months of implementing Measured with Tableau Cloud, Johnny Was profitably scaled into five new digital tactics, using guidance that was proven by Measured to be directionally sound. It strategically increased its Facebook spend by 30x, scaled its catalog prospecting, and right-sized its retargeting investments, all using Measured insights and aimed squarely at meeting the brand's stated incremental net profit increase objectives. With insights from Measured, Johnny Was doubled its online business in 18 months. The brand aggressively scaled its budget to a 177 percent increase during that period, confident in their decision making and newly bolstered by the visibility into their cross-channel approach. At the same time, the brand improved its marketing efficiency by 24 percent in terms of net profit versus spend. The last month of the period was December 2018, which was their best month ever for profits, and which represented an 84 percent gain in marketing efficiency year-over-year. Like many of Measured's clients, Johnny Was drew positive insights from the experience, including:\n\u2022 Better measurement enables better decisions\n\u2022 Incremental measurement clarifies each media tactic's contribution to the business\n\u2022 A media mix driven by incremental measurement can promote huge growth for a D2C business With the Tableau platform powering these insights and delivering a user experience to stakeholders at Johnny Was that was integrated with their daily work, the brand is on its way to achieving its 5-year, 10x sales growth goal. Measured is a cross-channel marketing data platform driving advanced intelligence and media investment decisions for direct-to-consumer brands. Its cross-channel reporting and decision guidance helps growth-focused brands inform the true incremental contribution of paid media tactics so they can refine their profitability strategies and achieve their long-term goals."

        "company": "El Al",
        "content": "El Al is the national airline of Israel and a symbol of the country around the world. Founded in 1948, it has grown to serve over 50 global destinations, flying six million passengers a year and generating more than $2 billion in revenue. It is also considered one of the world\u2019s most secure airlines, thanks to its stringent security protocols, both on the ground and onboard its aircraft. El Al uses Tableau to consolidate data from across the company into a single source of truth, driving data-based decision making and helping identify key operational areas where major cost savings can be made. Employees at all levels also use Tableau Mobile to view detailed data analytics on the go, from senior executives on the road, through to engineers servicing the company\u2019s fleet of aircrafts. As a major international airline, El Al relies on effective data analytics and information flow to ensure smooth operations in every area of its business, from ticket pricing and passenger details to aircraft refuelling and crew assignment. However, when Ido Biger joined the company as Chief Data Officer in 2018, one of the first things he noticed was how many of the company\u2019s individual departments were operating in silos, making collaboration difficult and causing conflict between teams. \u201cFrom a data perspective, El Al felt like seven different companies,\u201d says Ido. \u201cKey departments such as Engineering, Customer Service, Operations and Revenue Management all had their own data sources and analytics tools, resulting in a fragmented ecosystem that made effective information sharing very challenging.\u201d Ido knew that a central analytics platform would be key to solving this issue, consolidating all existing data sources into one single source of truth that the whole company could work from. He began by creating a shortlist of potential leading analytics solutions, including Tableau. He then worked with business champions from across El Al to collectively identify the best solution for the company\u2019s needs. \u201cWe tackled a current data use case in each of the shortlisted solutions, before deciding which was most effective,\u201d says Ido. \u201cTableau was unanimously chosen thanks to its ease of use, powerful visualisations and fast, effective data analytics capabilities.\u201d With Tableau now in place, employees throughout the company can be confident they are all working from the same data sets, making collaboration easy and eliminating the confusion that previously led to conflicts. \u201cDuplicate data sets are now a thing of the past, which means there\u2019s no more arguments in meetings about who\u2019s report is the correct one,\u201d says Ido. Uptake of Tableau has been extremely high across all departments as well. Dashboards are receiving over 700 views per day, less than six months after implementation, while many of its biggest users are at the most senior levels of the company, including the VP of Operations, VP of Commerce and the CEO himself. \u201cTableau\u2019s rich visualisations have a big \u2018wow\u2019 factor when people first see them,\u201d says Ido. \u201cOne of the first main advocates we had was the VP of Operations who quickly saw the potential. We created a great dashboard for him to show to other VPs and it wasn\u2019t long before everyone wanted it for their department.\u201d Using Tableau, El Al has been able to identify several new areas of its operations where significant monthly and annual cost savings can be made. Ido cites excess water supplies on flights as a great example of this. \u201cBy combining multiple data sources such as log files from the 787 Dreamliner, an Excel spreadsheet from our engineering department, DWH tables and a few web sites for the current USD/ILS and Brent Fuel price in Tableau and visualising the data, we immediately saw how much money was being wasted through overfilling water supplies on our Boeing 787 Dreamliners,\u201d says Ido. \u201cExcess water adds weight to the planes, which burns more fuel. Fuel is the largest operational cost for every airline, so even small savings per flight can quickly add up to significant amounts of money over the course of a year.\u201d Closer Tableau analysis of specific overfilled planes and the airports where overfilling was taking place has allowed El Al to virtually eliminate the issue across its fleet. \u201cIf we were still using Excel, we would never have identified this issue in the first place,\u201d says Ido. \u201cBut thanks to Tableau, we\u2019re expecting to save up hundreds of thousands of UDS annually on our operational costs.\u201d Due to the nature of its operations, a large percentage of El Al\u2019s employees work outside the traditional office environment, but they still need fast access to analytics and reporting in order to perform their jobs effectively. For this reason, Tableau Mobile plays a big role in the company\u2019s data strategy. \u201cTableau Mobile is huge for us,\u201d says Ido. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely easy to adjust a dashboard to fit mobile devices, which means members of our service and operational teams can still access all the information they need while out in the field.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just the field teams either,\u201d continues Ido. \u201cAlmost 80% of the time our Management spends using Tableau is via Tableau Mobile on their tablets or Cellular Phones.\u201d In total, around 25% of all dashboard views come via Tableau Mobile, helping the workforce stay connected to key data at all times, regardless of where they are. This fast, simple access is central to El Al\u2019s goal of becoming a fully data-driven company in the near future. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go but we\u2019re getting there,\u201d concludes Ido. \u201cThanks to Tableau, one visualisation can now unlock powerful insights across all departments. By 2020 we also hope to automate many of our data processes, saving employees time and freeing them up to focus on much more critical business activities.\u201d *Photo Credit: Yochai Mossi"

In the last year, WFP provided assistance to 91.4 million people in 83 countries. WFP started using Tableau thanks to a partnership contribution from the Tableau Foundation, with early use supporting the Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) unit\u2014 a network of 250 analysts around the world who collect, manage, and analyze data from a variety of sources, working closely with national governments, United Nations partners, and NGOs. With Tableau, analysts can identify food insecure populations to combat hunger. As more people got excited about the partnership and analyzing data, the Tableau community blossomed to over 3,000 users within WFP. The data team at WFP realized that they needed to set teams up for success with a formal governance strategy to support and encourage future growth. \u201cWe had a lot of organic growth and we wanted to bring in some governance. But we didn\u2019t have a very clear outline of the different components of what this structure could look like,\u201d shared Prianka Nandy, World Food Programme\u2019s Chief Data and Analytics Officer. To broaden, deepen, and scale their use of data, World Food Programme leveraged Tableau Blueprint to guide them through the process of building out capabilities that supported a flourishing, organization-wide Data Culture. WFP\u2019s analytics team started with what they call a \u201cserver reboot,\u201d focusing on content management within their Tableau Server environment. As a result of rapid growth\u2014about 12 times the size within 24 months\u2014there was an abundance of published dashboards on their Tableau Server, with very little organization, impacting discoverability. This also led to unnecessary work, since people were recreating dashboards and data sources that already served a specific purpose. \u201cWe found that some people were publishing multiple versions of the same data source, so we wanted to consolidate and bring some order to the chaos,\u201d shared Prianka. The team set out to create a sandbox environment so administrators could monitor server content and end users could have more clarity about what are ready-to-use products. This meant tracking high-profile content that could then be certified for widespread use or flagged for potential deletion if the content was stale. Tableau Blueprint helped the team bring structure to some of the questions they were getting from employees around data access\u2014for example, \u201cwhere is the data I need?\u201d or \u201cwhy can\u2019t I access this data source?\u201d Blueprint\u2019s governance framework helped them identify gaps in their data strategy, particularly around data quality and content management. They now understand the steps they needed to take to ensure data is fresh and trusted, as well as used responsibly across the organization. It also came in a good moment, since WFP is launching a new data strategy this November that will allow the organization to increase the amount of data available for analysis. \u201cIn this moment, we\u2019re making data a more powerful asset within the organization, bringing our data to a new level internally,\u201d shared Prianka. \u201cPreviously we thought of each track linearly, but Blueprint changed our perspective\u2014that they need to run in parallel.\u201d As part of these strategic discussions, they found clarity around roles and responsibilities, particularly around server management and governance. They also found that they needed additional headcount to support their plan and to help advocate for best practices moving forward. \u201cBlueprint helped us to identify the need for a new headcount to head up governance and help with the robust server configuration change we needed, including training our users and administrators on how to publish and certify data sources. The lack of knowledge on this has been generating a huge number of avoidable tickets and really impacting our daily work,\u201d explained Prianka. Since WFP started using Tableau in the field with their VAM unit, they already had a solid foundation of community engagement. For example, the team had partnered with Tableau Visionaries to build out a Data Week to encourage learning and sharing data analytics best practices. But previously, this community was largely organic, growing from one-on-one mentor relationships. With Blueprint, the team saw an opportunity to channel the power of this organic community into a more structured program. To start, they focused on the internal users\u2014understanding who is using the product and who could use more support. This meant establishing a Tableau Champions Group that advocates on behalf of the wider group of users across the organization. Blueprint acted as a starting point for these conversations so the team could establish drivers for each of the necessary community initiatives. \u201cBlueprint has a community chapter that gives specific examples of activities you can start, as well as how to engage your user base,\u201d said Maria Christina, Head of Data Architecture. The World Food Programme analytics team decided to use their solid community foundation to kickstart a training program for employees. Because of their focus on content management, WFP spearheaded trainings on this topic. After just three training sessions, the team already saw increased involvement from users and they\u2019re now planning new sessions to help project leaders and publishers to better understand the role they play on server health. An example of topic planned for these sessions is how to publish a dashboard to Tableau Server\u2014including details around permissions, how to use sandboxes, and how to get a view certified for wider use. Community engagement activities continue to spark new ideas around training topics. Maria explained how \u201ctraining is generating engagement and the engagement is generating ideas for the training. So the process has been very circular in a sense. These things grow on each other and help to move our strategy forward.\u201d As the team plans for the future, they want to use Blueprint as a guide for strategy and headcount decisions and to keep everyone on the same page as they kick-start conversations about additional technology investments. \u201cI have a feeling that we\u2019re going to keep on iterating in the cycle of growth. We are going to see each branch in the Blueprint subway map develop on its own. At the same time, we are making sure that we adjust to ensure that we don\u2019t lose sight of the bigger picture,\u201d shared Maria. The next step in their journey is to assess all of the disparate data sources within WFP to break down silos and prioritize data quality. There is also more work to be done around governance at the data source level, while balancing the need for self-service business intelligence."

        "company": "Luxoft",
        "content": "Luxoft, a DXC Technology Company, is a digital strategy and software engineering firm providing bespoke technology solutions that drive business change for customers the world over. When Luxoft started using Tableau in 2010 to improve its business analytics capabilities, it was one of the first companies in Russia to do so. In 2015, it set up a new corporate business intelligence centre in Moscow to support the whole organisation, using Tableau as its primary visual analytics platform. Doing so has helped create a single point of truth for the whole company, cutting time to insight, improving data quality and streamlining a wide range of internal operations including human resources, sales and executive insights. Luxoft created its corporate business intelligence centre in 2015 with the aim of achieving a series of key objectives. These included using data to better aid decision making at the executive level, improving data quality in corporate systems, and reducing the quantity of manual data reporting taking place throughout the company. In order to achieve these, it first needed to consolidate its 100+ data sources into a central, unified platform that could be accessed and used by all employees. It undertook a major corporate data warehouse overhaul, enriching existing databases in a Microsoft SQL Server with new data sources and quality assurance procedures, implementing Alteryx and EasyMorph to aid with data preparation and extraction, and promoting Tableau as the primary data analytics tool for all. This new approach has significantly streamlining data management and analytics throughout the company. The combination of Microsoft SQL Server data warehouse and Alteryx/EasyMorph has improved data quality and eliminated fragmented data silos, while Tableau has created a single source of truth that greatly increases confidence in data. Executives can now quickly access accurate, consistent insights and self-serve their own data analytics requirements whenever required, cutting speed to insight from hours to minutes. \u201cBefore Tableau, everyone would bring their own PowerPoints and Excel spreadsheets to meetings, which would often cause conflicts and create confusion,\u201d says Natalia Liubimova, Head of Data and Analytics Center, Luxoft. \u201cNow almost all decision-making in nearly every area of the organisation is supported with beautiful Tableau dashboards that provide a single, consistent view of information for all\u201d, continues Alex Barakov, Head of Reporting Office. Luxoft has used Tableau\u2019s deep functionality to improve self-service analytics and overall business intelligence within numerous departments. A great example of this is its integration with Salesforce via Tableau\u2019s native connector, which has provided the entire sales team with secure, up-to-date, fully customisable views of key sales data sets. \u201cWe started by downloading Salesforce Starter templates from the Tableau website, which helped us hit the ground running with a wide range of dashboards that were tailored to the specific needs of the sales team,\u201d says Natalia. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take users long to realise the value that Tableau insights can bring to their day-to-day activity. As a result, uptake has been exceptionally high throughout the department from day one.\u201d As users familiarise themselves with Tableau\u2019s toolset, the analysis becomes deeper and deeper. Less than a year on from initial integration, there are Tableau reports covering the full range of sales operations, while additional connections to other internal data sources such as finance and recruitment have enabled an even wider range of analysis to be conducted. The Data and Analytics team has also created a series of Tableau reports to keep senior executives informed of all the latest sales activity and results. Whilst predominantly top line, the reports are fully interactive, allowing executives to drill down into the data wherever they wish. \u201cIn just a few clicks, Tableau\u2019s dashboards can go from high level overviews to detailed deep dives,\u201d says Alex. \u201cFurthermore, their live connection to the data warehouse means the information they contain is always accurate and up to date, which is hugely important at the senior level.\u201d Tableau analytics has also helped to improve many aspects of Luxoft\u2019s HR function, resulting in greater transparency and more efficient operations. Embedded dashboards have replaced Excel spreadsheets for the monitoring of HR processes such as appraisals, training, benefits, salaries, promotions and more, allowing HR team members to quickly see an employees\u2019 full history on a single visualisation, whenever required. Recruitment is another key area, with Tableau used to track all current job vacancies alongside projected future resourcing requirements, in line with predicted company growth. This approach allows the team to stay ahead of curve, proactively managing the workforce rather than reacting to resourcing issues as and when they arise. \u201cTracking key HR processes in Tableau rather than Excel means the team can visualise and interrogate data sets far more quickly and accurately than before, resulting in more efficient overall operations,\u201d says Natalia. \u201cAn effective HR function means happier, more satisfied employees, helping to reduce turnover and minimise avoidable crunch points that are caused by poor planning and inadequate staffing levels.\u201d Going forward, the Data and Analytics team is planning to implement a number of new Tableau initiatives across the business. These include embedded tips and navigation assistance on Tableau Server, rebranding dashboard designs to improve consistency, and automating reporting processes in additional areas including finance. \u201cAt our last count, we had around 1,000 users of Tableau server, working with over 700 active dashboards across 80 projects or more,\u201d says Alex. \u201cAs its popularity continues to grow within Luxoft, we have created a clear path towards improving the functionality we can offer to make employees\u2019 day-to-day lives even easier, as well as improving the efficiency of the business as a whole.\u201d"

        "company": "Polysphere",
        "content": "Polysphere is a dynamic, niche focused consulting and software company specialising in the use of data analytics and bespoke applications to solve key business challenges in the commercial mining industry. Based in South Africa, it develops systems that enhance mine management at an operational level by improving processes, insights and performance tracking. Polysphere uses Tableau to deliver fast, accurate analytics to customers via embedded dashboards. Its ease of use and intuitive functionality have allowed Polysphere to cut its system production times in half, providing a significant competitive advantage and putting key insights into the hands of customers much faster than previously possible. Cloud based delivery also means no installation is required on users\u2019 machines, while its rich visual analytics provide a real \u2018wow factor\u2019 that consistently blows customers away. Polysphere has been developing new management systems and tools for the mining industry for over 14 years. The company\u2019s first tool was an employee bonus administration system, helping customers track performance over time and assign bonuses to large numbers of employees accordingly. Since then it has grown to deliver a wide range of data-based systems and solutions that help customers enhance management at an operational level. Initially, Polysphere used a combination of Excel, SQL based tools and third party services for the majority of its report analytics, but it quickly became clear that this wasn\u2019t a viable way of doing things. \u201cSome of our customers have upwards of 30,000 employees so there\u2019s a lot of data involved. Manually adding analytics elements to our reports via tools like Excel was incredibly time consuming. On the other hand, using third party services was prohibitively expensive,\u201d says Raf Bryla, Managing Director of Polysphere. \u201cWe knew we needed a better solution that we could control ourselves but was capable of quickly producing the kind of rich insights our customers were looking for.\u201d Polysphere evaluated QlikView, Microsoft Power BI and Tableau but quickly settled on Tableau due to its ease of use and compatibility with the way Polysphere develops its existing solutions. Following a successful trial period, the company implemented Tableau Desktop for development and Tableau Reader to deploy analytics to customers. More recently, it has started delivering visualisations directly to customers using Tableau Embedded, making analytics even simpler and more accessible. \u201cOnce we started using Tableau Embedded things really exploded for us,\u201d says Raf. \u201cEverything is delivered via Tableau Server, so customer don\u2019t have to install anything on their machines in order to start viewing and interrogating the data. They soon started requesting more and more Viewer licenses for their teams. In the last six months we\u2019ve added hundreds of licenses and its growing all the time.\u201d Raf highlights Tableau\u2019s rich visual elements as a key selling point, allowing Polysphere to present findings and analytics in a way that blows both old and new customers away. \u201cSimply put, we cannot do what we do in Tableau anywhere else. It\u2019s the whole package and it just works,\u201d adds Raf. \u201cIt\u2019s enabled us to create things that we weren\u2019t able to create before from a content and concept point of view. The wow factor of our applications has doubled since we started using Tableau.\u201d Another major benefit of Tableau is that it\u2019s enabled Polysphere to bring new systems and applications to production up to 50 percent faster than previously possible. Not only has this helped cut development costs, it\u2019s provided Raf and his team with a significant competitive advantage in the market. \u201cWhen I\u2019m pitching to customers, I\u2019m competing against people that provide a quote for something that\u2019ll take them six months,\u201d says Raf. \u201cUsing Tableau, I can do the same thing in three.\u201d This provides a tangible cost saving, both for customers and Polysphere. However, as Raf points out, cost isn\u2019t always the primary driving factor for many customers. \u201cWhen they have an urgent need to solve a problem and I tell them that I can solve it for them, or at least give them insight into it, in half the time of competitors, that\u2019s what gets them really excited, not how much it\u2019s going to cost,\u201d says Raf. \u201cWe recently deployed an executive level solution for one of our customers, using Tableau to combine multiple key data sets into a single set of dashboards,\u201d continues Raf. \u201cThey had been trying and failing to do this themselves for over a year before approaching us. With Tableau, we were able to do it in two months.\u201d Tableau has also allowed Polysphere to leverage its existing systems in new ways, using analytics to extract more information for customers and open new revenue streams for the company. \u201cDue to the work we do, we\u2019re sitting on gigabytes of data that in the past was only used for transactional purposes,\u201d says Raf. \u201cWith Tableau we can unlock this gold mine of information to deliver analytical insights that can be used for management purposes as well. It\u2019s enabled us to create new products out of systems we already had but were unable to monetise.\u201d Tableau\u2019s ease of use is another key benefit, meaning Polysphere doesn\u2019t need to employ specialist developers solely to work on analytics and create data visualisations. \u201cWith Tableau, I can use engineers and consultants to perform analytics, whereas traditionally I had to use developers that didn\u2019t really understand the business he/she was developing for,\u201d says Raf. \u201cNow, my principal consultant, who is not a developer but a business person, can use Tableau to visualise what we are going to show customers, then she can go away and develop the application once everyone is happy.\u201d \u201cThis is key for us because it means no time is wasted explaining to a developer what they needs to do and how they needs to do it, while they don\u2019t really understand the mining business,\u201d continues Raf. \u201cI can use mere mortals to do visual analytics, I don\u2019t need specialists anymore.\u201d For Raf, Tableau adds a new layer to Polysphere\u2019s overall offering that makes it the complete solution for customers. \u201cIf you look at our website, our tagline is \u2018sharpening your competitive edge\u2019,\u201d concludes Raf. \u201cIn a nutshell, Tableau has sharpened our own edge that little bit more.\u201d"

        "title": "Leading travel company, Seera Group empowers users to self-serve analytics in Tableau with Slack integration",
        "company": "Seera Group",
        "content": "Seera Group is the leading travel and tourism services company in the Middle East. Founded in 1979 as Al Tayyar Travel Group, its growing portfolio of travel brands has helped families, businesses, holidaymakers, pilgrims and government officials move around the region and the world for the last 40 years. In April 2019, the company rebranded as Seera Group, marking the start of a new chapter in its successful history. Seera Group began using Tableau in 2017 as part of a major IT restructure, which saw it consolidate over 20 different data sources into a cloud-based data lake and transform itself into a truly data driven organisation. Tableau is now the hub for analytics across the whole of the company\u2019s online business, improving data consistency and reducing customer acquisition costs by 10%, saving $1m in the last 6 months alone. Its automated reporting features also save the online marketing team hundreds of hours a month, while Slack integration enables fast, easy self-service analytics for employees in every department. As Seera Group has grown over the last 40 years, so too has the number of data sources it relies on. The company currently has over 20 data sources in regular use, including Hive tables, SQL databases, Google Analytics and a wide variety of offline sources such as Excel spreadsheets. Prior to Tableau, data consistency was becoming increasingly problematic, with different groups working from a variety of sources or creating multiple versions of the same information. When Louise Blake joined the company in 2017 with a blank slate and a goal to make data integral to all business operations, she immediately addressed the growing fragmentation caused by so many disparate sources. She began by implementing a cloud-based data lake hosted in AWS, followed by Tableau as the sole analytics and visualisation platform to support the company\u2019s entire online business. \u201cA key reason for choosing Tableau over the company\u2019s previous BI solution was its scalability, meaning it can grow alongside us without any issues,\u201d says Louise. \u201cTableau\u2019s ease of use and ability to visualise and analyse data sources also meant we didn\u2019t need programmers to use it. We could do pretty much anything we wanted ourselves, right from the off.\u201d With nearly all data sources now feeding into the data lake and connected through Tableau, the new infrastructure has created a consolidated data hub throughout the whole business. Its Tableau Server is now also hosted in AWS, meaning the entire ecosystem is cloud based. As a result, all data can be updated daily, which wasn\u2019t previously possible. In addition, some key areas like customer reviews are updated hourly, allowing the company to respond extremely quickly wherever necessary. The Centre of Excellence team is saving over 3 hours of preparation time ahead of every client-facing meeting, for instance. \u201cNow all data sets can be visualised together in Tableau, which makes everything much more transparent,\u201d says Louise. \u201cHaving a cloud-based ecosystem means everyone can be confident they\u2019re looking at the latest figures and there\u2019s no more conflict about which team has the \u2018right\u2019 numbers because everyone is looking at the same data, directly in Tableau.\u201d Another key goal for Louise was to enable self-service analytics for all employees in the online business as naturally as possible. One of the main ways she achieved this was by integrating Tableau directly into the popular collaboration tool Slack, putting fast, accurate analytics directly at everyone\u2019s fingertips. \u201cWe looked at all of the most popular dashboards across the business and quickly saw the ones showing things like weekly KPIs were viewed a lot,\u201d says Louise. \u201cThen, using Python we created a chatbot that allows users to ask questions about data like this directly in Slack and receive answers straight back from Tableau.\u201d Employees can then click on any metric they receive in Slack and it will open the entire Tableau dashboard for further information and analytics. \u201cThe uptake on this has been huge because it gives users access to data they need, through a tool they already have open and use all day,\u201d says Louise. \u201cWe\u2019ve empowered them to self-serve their own analytics and many of them don\u2019t even realise they\u2019re doing it!\u201d Over 80% of the online business now uses Tableau regularly, in departments ranging from the product team to the sourcing team, strategy team and finance. One of the teams benefiting most is the online marketing team. \u201cThe marketing team used to spend two hours a day, per person, on reporting across 60 Google Sheets,\u201d Louise. \u201cBy connecting APIs and automating these reports in Tableau, not only have they saved hundreds of hours a month, but everything can now be seen in just one dashboard.\u201d This new approach to marketing analytics means the team can review ongoing activity daily, rather than reactively at the end of the month. Considerable improvements in spending efficiency enables the team to save over $1m every 6 months thanks to a 10% reduction in customer acquisition cost. \u201cSince switching to Tableau, the team can easily see which marketing channels are working and which aren\u2019t,\u201d says Louise. \u201cThose that aren\u2019t working can be quickly switched off, with resources immediately funneled into more effective activity.\u201d These benefits haven\u2019t gone unnoticed and other teams within Seera Group are starting to use Tableau in a similar fashion. \u201cThe product team is now using Tableau to monitor user activity across our different platforms such as the app, the web and in-store,\u201d says Louise. \u201cBy viewing everything in one place they can see customer drop-offs more easily and analyse why it\u2019s happening.\u201d While the online business leads the company\u2019s use of Tableau, the rest of the business is quickly catching up, including the expanding retail network of Seera Group\u2019s consumer travel business - As part of the Seera Group transformation, data became a corporate function, and is as critical to the business as IT, Finance or HR. \u201cTableau has democratised data within Seera Group and really helped bring the company together,\u201d says Louise, now VP Data. \u201cIt\u2019s providing solutions to real world needs and solving issues people didn\u2019t even know data could help with until now.\u201d"

The Charity has standardised on the powerful, secure and flexible Tableau analytics platform to rapidly share and collaborate on data and insights. This is enabling the Charity to identify the areas within the two boroughs with the greatest density of health problems \u2013 and target the appropriate resources more effectively. Simultaneously, the simple, transparent insights are focusing the way their endowment is spent in pursuit of improved health. Up-to-the-minute analyses and findings are also being shared with partners, the general public and others working on similar initiatives for further enhanced health outcomes. Over the next decade, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Charity is spending approximately quarter of a billion GBP in tackling complex health issues and improving the livelihood of local residents. As part of a new forward-thinking strategy, the Charity is focusing its resources on the most prominent health issues that are impacting lives in the two London boroughs, including childhood obesity. A primary challenge for Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Charity is to identify regions in the greatest need of charitable support and allocate budget and resources accordingly. \u201cWe need to answer questions like, \u2018Which are the priority locations for these projects?\u2019 and \u2018How should we pool our resources?\u2019,\u201d explains Rob Parker, Head of Data and Analytics at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Charity. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that data plays a vital role in answering these questions.\" Until recently, Rob and his team relied on traditional means to identify the areas within Lambeth and Southwark most in need of attention. \u201cThe CEO of the Charity asked me where we should begin our childhood obesity programme, so I went away and built some scatter points in Excel. This gave us some basic insight into childhood obesity across neighbourhoods, which we correlated against other measures, such as income and deprivation,\u201d he says. However, the drawbacks to this reliance on Excel quickly became apparent. \u201cOnce we shared this basic insight across the Charity, we quickly received follow-up questions regarding the significance of individual points in the diagram. We could just about provide this extra level of insight using Excel, but it was very slow and time-consuming,\u201d says Rob. Several colleagues recommended Tableau as a solution. Rob was converted immediately. \u201cI had a play-around with the free version of Tableau on a Sunday morning, and quickly created a completely different view of the data. I could reach a scatter point and if someone asked \u2018what\u2019s that point?\u2019, I could say \u2018that\u2019s Camberwell Green\u2019. These immediate insights radically changed the way we work.\u201d This ability to connect and collaborate on the interactive maps is generating valuable, transparent intelligence into childhood obesity. Rob explains, \u201cTableau has enabled us to discover genuine insights into childhood obesity across the boroughs. For example, if you take the top 12 wards by childhood obesity and map them, it\u2019s immediately apparent that those wards are right next to each other.\u201d For its childhood obesity programme, the Charity specifically needed to identify the streets in Lambeth and Southwark with the highest rates of childhood obesity. That meant bringing together multiple different datasets to define the target region. \u201cWe wanted areas with very high levels of childhood obesity, areas with a large number of retail food outlets \u2013 because that\u2019s who we\u2019ll work with \u2013 we wanted some schools in the target region and we also wanted to analyse certain bus stops,\u201d says Rob. \u201cUsing the latest inbuilt maps and the new hyper files, Tableau gave us answers to our questions within 20 minutes. It\u2019s incredible how easy it was to do.\u201d By pinpointing the precise location of each problem area, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Charity has been able expand their programmes more rapidly \u2013 and to where they are needed most. This is imperative since the Charity\u2019s strategy calls for 70% of the resources allocated to a problem area to be used within that region \u2013 they are now operating at over 80%. Moreover, the integration of the Charity\u2019s Salesforce application with Tableau is helping to validate that spend. \u201cWe have data in Salesforce that shows where we spend our money, which we\u2019ve mapped in Tableau,\u201d explains Rob. \u201cWe also have a map of where we\u2019ve identified need. Those two maps are very, very similar.\u201d The new maps also provide valuable input into Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Charity\u2019s accountability reports. \u201cThe visual nature of the maps provides a simple, persuasive means of validating our investment. It enables us to explain to interested parties why we have funded one project over another, improving our accountability.\u201d The entire organisation is now connected to the universal Tableau reporting system. \u201cOur trustees now have access to the financial data they need through Tableau Cloud. They can select the information they find interesting, in the level of detail they find interesting,\u201d says Rob. Looking ahead, Rob and his team plan on using Tableau to better inform partners as well as the general public on current analyses and findings. \u201cWe are now exploring how we can use Tableau Public to share that information more broadly with other interested parties. After all, the insights we are revealing may be useful to individuals working on similar social initiatives.\u201d Learn more about Guy's and St Thomas' Charity's mission on Rob Parker's Tableau Public profile."

The company operates more than 50 bottling plants in Western Europe, serving 300 million customers in 13 countries and generating annual revenues of around \u20ac11 billion. By replacing its outdated analytics and reporting tools with a comprehensive Tableau and Alteryx solution, Coca-Cola has saved significant amounts of time whilst eliminating many of the errors resulting from manual analysis. With Tableau Server and Tableau Mobile, employees can also now access powerful dashboards and visualizations from anywhere at any time, empowering the field sales team and encouraging a new data driven culture throughout the organisation. Coca-Cola European Partners employs more than 23,500 staff to make, sell and distribute the world\u2019s most loved drinks brands to over 300 million people in 13 countries. Such large scale operations rely heavily on accurate reporting and analytics. However, prior to Tableau, the combination of outdated tools and growing data volumes was impacting overall productivity. \u201cWe really had some challenges in terms of the amount of data running through our systems, our ability to quickly make sense of it, and how we could distribute key insights to our stakeholders in a consistent way,\u201d recalls Johannes S\u00e6thre, Strategy and Insights Manager at Coca-Cola European Partners. Previously, reporting was predominantly conducted manually using basic tools such as Excel and PowerPoint. The difficulty of analysing data in Excel, combined with the effort of repeatedly generating and distributing reports via email, meant the process was both labour intensive and time consuming. To address these issues, Coca-Cola European Partners decided to install a comprehensive new data analytics and reporting solution consisting of Tableau Desktop and Server, alongside Alteryx for data prep and enrichment. This new approach allows a wide range of disparate data sources across the company to be analysed together through a single platform for the first time, resulting in much faster and more accurate reporting. \u201cA lot of our data is currently running from Redshift (AWS),\u201d says Johannes S\u00e6thre. \u201cWe also have supporting databases, where we use CSV files or Excel files, along with some native connectors to applications like Salesforce, all of which are now connected via Tableau.\u201d Tableau Server allows Johannes and his team to publish live dashboards and reports across the entire organisation at the touch of a button rather than sending mass emails. Employees can then access the information at any time and be confident that what they are seeing is always up-to-date, helping avoid conflicts or confusion. Critically, Tableau has also enabled the team to automate some of the more time consuming aspects of reporting throughout the company, saving significant amounts of time and eliminating many of the errors resulting from manual analysis. \u201cWe've gone from this ad-hoc, manual approach to an automated solution where I just drink my morning coffee and by the time I\u2019ve finished, everything is up to date,\u201d says Johannes. \u201cNot only can Tableau handle the vast amounts of data we now have to deal with each day, its ease of use and powerful visualisations mean everyone can use it and key insights are never overlooked.\u201d The introduction of Tableau has encouraged a new, data-centric attitude throughout Coca-Cola European Partners that didn\u2019t previously exist. \u201cA lot of things have happened in terms of our data culture since we implemented Tableau,\u201d says Johannes. \u201cWhen people learn to interact with data and use it more in their daily activities, it becomes insanely impactful. Many of the things that we do today would not have been possible three years ago and that's easy to forget.\u201d As a result, the role of data analytics has grown tremendously throughout numerous key departments including sales, marketing and product development, with more and more employees looking to self-serve their own analytics needs in Tableau. \u201cAnyone who receives a data point or any kind of analytics via Tableau always wants to learn more about what they can do with it,\u201d says Johannes. \u201cSo establishing a data culture is truly an exciting journey to be a part of, but it also comes with a great responsibility in terms of constantly being able to add more value to the business wherever possible.\u201d A great example of this is how the recent introduction of Tableau Mobile has helped empower the field sales team by putting crucial information directly into the hands of employees whilst they are on site with customers and prospects. \u201cUsing Tableau Mobile, our sales guys can now access all this great data about their customers directly on their iPads, just before they go into meetings,\u201d says Johannes. \u201cThey can then use this information to put together a great sales pitch and establish really close relationships with customers that will pay dividends in the future.\u201d"

        "company": "Mondelez International",
        "content": "Mondel\u0113z International, Inc. is the largest producer of biscuits, chocolate, and candy products in the world, with a net revenue of over $20 billion and products in more than 160 countries, including Oreo, ChipsAhoy, BelVita, Toblerone, Lacta, Milka, Trident, etc. Mondel\u0113z\u2019s Global Procurement Data Analytics team delivers superior business value by driving operational efficiencies, cash generation, and cost savings upwards of several million dollars. As Senior Manager of Global Procurement Analytics and Strategy, Igor Vasquez and his team help the Global Procurement Organization manage over $60 billion dollars of spend and nearly 28,000 including direct and indirect materials suppliers over a three-year period. This success was made possible by leveraging Tableau to transform traditional procurement into a digital process. In the past, procurement, risk, and finance systems were disconnected across more than 160 data fields and 42 million transactions\u2014including purchase orders, invoices, and payments. The team began driving this digital procurement strategy with two goals in mind: 1) establish one data repository for all purchase order and invoice transactions and 2) create an infrastructure to support and visualize analysis of these transactions with Tableau. By integrating all data to a central repository, they established a standard, global solution of sustainable analytics for a complex supply chain, leading to simplified spend KPIs worldwide, improved analytics and customer satisfaction, and more responsible business practices. The team and key partners in the Information Systems department embarked on a journey to find a digital, global solution to enable one repository of data and one analytics platform, improve business process efficiencies for cost savings, and develop an agile analytics model. Financial and procurement data were siloed in legacy systems, requiring the team to implement interfaces between systems to extract data. Analysis was time-consuming and stuck in spreadsheets, preventing the Global Procurement Data Analytics team from effectively serving stakeholders or structuring data with end user adoption and satisfaction in mind. To transition to a digital approach, the team focused on asking questions about how procurement and spend data were consumed by stakeholders and how procurement data integrated across global systems. They wanted flexibility in order to provide greater value to the business: the ability to filter data by region, spend categories, measure complexity of payment terms, better manage suppliers, and identify risks that impact net revenue. Ultimately, the Global Procurement Data Analytics team adopted SAP HANA to host the central data repository and decided on Tableau as their analytics platform to support spend analysis. The procurement organization now have complete spend visibility, integrating data end-to-end for a sustainable analytics model and reducing dependencies and reporting times. In order to understand with high level of accuracy and effectiveness the use of cash in supplier payments, a global process needed to be put in place to ensure standards were followed. The Weighted Average Payment Terms report was developed allowing a process that used to take eight weeks, now takes only two weeks with Tableau. Across this report, among others, the Global Procurement Data Analytics team has analyzed millions of transactions and seen significant time savings by integrating data and using Tableau. Igor and team have enabled the procurement function to focus on strategy and proactively mitigate risk. With plans in progress to use Tableau dashboards to have full visibility into their supply chain, they will be able to take future action avoid revenue impacts when a supplier is at risk of not having an item like cocoa or wheat, for example, to prevent negative impacts to revenue. Furthermore, managing payment terms is an area where end-to-end data integration proves its value. Having accurate visibility into spend across 28,000 suppliers allows the team to see which suppliers they're spending more with and adjust payment terms accordingly\u2014to 90 days or 120 days, for example. This visibility also informs how to increase value from existing suppliers or plan for supplier base reduction. Having more than 100 traditional reports, 20% of which were used, pushed the team to review which reports were most valuable and actionable. By consolidating spend and supplier information, they created 10 simple, yet powerful Tableau dashboards to serve all 475 stakeholders, across all categories and regions globally. By enabling this digital transformation, Igor and a multifunctional team of 20 members\u2014and growing\u2014can scale and support over 475 Tableau users, with more planned, while maintaining continual collaboration with both internal and external stakeholders. After having launched their digital solution with Tableau, the feedback from stakeholders has been unanimously positive. People love the insightful analysis, saying, \"Just show me Tableau,\" rejecting traditional spreadsheet-based reporting. They ask, \"How can we get more?\" Igor makes a point of collaborating with senior procurement leadership in North America, the finance team in Europe, and category leads in Asia and Latin America, to understand the business questions they're trying to answer. Involving stakeholders in the process to establish these questions means alignment on which metrics matter, resulting in better service and increased adoption. The team examine spend KPIs by region and existing Strategic and Operational processes with the single data source and Tableau platform in order to drive cost savings and generate cash. By using Tableau to enable alignment across the entire company, departments can understand what data their stakeholders need to focus on, and have one channel to communicate these insights. Confidence in the data is increased because KPIs have been defined and standardized. Reports that previously took one to two hours of explanation are now visualizations that can be consumed and understood by stakeholders in minutes, simplifying communication across departments. To support regional leaders, the team addresses challenges or gaps regions have in meeting their KPIs with tailored strategies and operational dashboards. Procurement analytics enables leaders to understand levels of spend and volume of materials purchased, which informs supplier negotiations and increases cost savings. An especially fruitful collaboration for the procurement team has been with the finance department. Together, finance and procurement look at the following spend KPIs to eliminate unnecessary costs and improve operational efficiency, taking a specific approach for each:\n1. Cash conversion cycle from the supply chain perspective \u2013 focus on managing appropriate payment term levels well to balance cash flow\n2. Days paid outstanding (DPO) \u2013 pay special attention to payment terms of suppliers with higher spend to hold onto funds, generating cash.\n3. Simplification of supply chain \u2013 looking at complexity of supply chain and reducing operational cost of maintaining too many suppliers, ingredients, etc. By collaborating, both the Mondel\u0113z finance and procurement departments have been able to establish a crucial, yet previously lacking aspect in legacy reporting: consistency. As a joint effort, these two groups committed to consistent reporting through common databases and Tableau dashboards, requiring that any differences in reporting be explained. Discussions around inconsistencies are focused on the common goal of supporting cost savings and investment efforts across both departments. The success of such interdepartmental collaborations has enabled Mondel\u0113z colleagues of all analytical skill levels to go beyond creating dashboards in order to focus on driving business value with data insights. With a central data repository and the Tableau analytics platform, the Global Procurement Data Analytics team supports Mondel\u0113z International\u2019s mission to empower people to snack right in a sustainable and responsible way. Igor said, \"We use analytics not only for our business, but also for caring about our world.\" It\u2019s not just data that is integrated with an end-to-end approach\u2014Mondel\u0113z also approaches sourcing and production the same way: by focusing on sustainable agriculture and reducing their environmental footprint through end-to-end sustainability goals. Achieving sustainability goals is possible with all supply chain data managed in a powerful analytics platform and central data repository. This digital procurement strategy has allowed Igor and Global Procurement Data Analytics team to drive operational efficiencies, increase cost savings, and deliver superior business value across at Mondel\u0113z International."

        "company": "Elsevier",
        "content": "Elsevier is an information analytics company and one of the world's major providers of scientific, technical, and medical information. Originally founded in 1880 it publishes more than 470,000 articles annually in 2,500 journals and has an annual turnover in excess of \u00a32.5 billion (2018). Elsevier began using Tableau as its primary visualisation and analytics platform in 2017 to create a single data source across the business and eliminate unnecessary licensing costs for numerous other tools. Since implementation Tableau usage has grown significantly, with over 20 different business departments now self-serving their data analytics needs through it every day. There are currently over 1,300 employees using Tableau throughout Elsevier to inform decision making, deliver fast, accurate reporting, and enable a more proactive approach to key business functions including marketing and sales. In turn, it provides insights and efficiencies that help these teams better serve their customers. Elsevier is an information analytics company that specialises in helping health, technology and science professionals make better decisions through its wide range of published works and intelligence services. However, as the company grew over time, the data sources and tools being used internally were becoming increasingly fragmented, which was having a detrimental effect on data consistency and business efficiency. \"We had a lot of people in our organisation using different types of tools,\" recalls Tom Perry, Senior Director Data, Insights & Integration at Elsevier. \"So in 2017 we did a major analysis to understand what tools best fitted where we wanted to be as an organisation. Early on we found a lot of people in our organisation loved using Tableau and really embraced it, so we chose it as the visualisation tool for our entire organisation.\u201d As a result, Elsevier has been able to centralise all of its data through one single platform, creating a single source of truth and improving data consistency across the whole company. \u201cWithin Elsevier we have a lot of legacy relational data warehouses like Oracle and Postgres alongside our more modern data lake in Amazon S3,\u201d says Tom. \u201cUsing Tableau we can view and analyse data from all these sources in a single location, helping to break down internal silos and ensure employees from across the organisation are working off the same data at all times.\u201d Elsevier has also been able to eliminate a lot of unnecessary licensing costs associated with numerous other reporting and analytics tools previously being used throughout the company. \u201cBy centralising our data through Tableau, not only have we been able to create a more consistent approach to reporting and analytics across the company, we're driving insights that help us better serve customers, and we\u2019ve made significant savings in our operational costs,\u201d adds Tom. Since the beginning of the rollout, Tableau usage within Elsevier has grown at an exponential rate. \u201cThe one thing that caught us by surprise was the scale and the speed that Tableau took off. It was like a viral effect,\u201d says Tom. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d have to do a lot of selling to gain that initial traction and momentum but as soon as the first users started to get on it, everybody wanted to use it. We went from a few Tableau Desktop users to over 200 within 6 to 9 months.\u201d The company now has over 20 sites within Tableau, each representing a different department, and more than 1,300 interactors on Tableau Server. User numbers continue to grow all the time, in all corners of the business. \u201cWe have a lot of Tableau users in Sales, while Marketing uses it for customer segmentation. Finance does its reporting in Tableau and we recently rolled out some CFO dashboards, which allows our CFO to make key business decisions,\u201d says Tom. \u201cWe\u2019re also using it in HR within the people analytics space, we use it in Technology to manage our software development life-cycle, plus multiple other areas of the business. The list goes on and on.\" This growth has helped foster a powerful new culture of self-service analytics within the company, as more and more people realise the information they need is rarely more than a few clicks away in Tableau. \u201cWhen we first implemented Tableau a lot of people embraced it immediately, but some said \u2018you guys in tech have always done our reports and analytics for us so can\u2019t you just continue to do that?\u2019. But as we worked through our journey and showed people how easy it was to get those kinds of insights themselves, the real eureka moments came out,\u201d says Tom. \u201cNow we can take a step back and support them in their own journeys rather than having to do everything centrally. So it's good to see successes across the business, people taking ownership and actually getting a lot of that gratification from it. I think that\u2019s a big win.\u201d One of the departments to benefit most from the implementation of Tableau in Elsevier is the sales team. \"We recently went through a major transformation programme, moving from our legacy sales technology systems to a much more modern approach that\u2019s built around Salesforce and incorporates embedded analytics from Tableau,\" explains Tom. Previously, at the end of the month, sales staff received a few reports and then determined whether or not they had achieved their goals. Only then could countermeasures be taken if necessary. Now, Tableau dashboards embedded directly into Salesforce show employees up-to-date figures on business development at any time, meaning they can take immediate corrective action in the event of deviations. \"With Tableau embedded in Salesforce, our sales team can be much more proactive in its approach now, rather than being reactive as it was before,\u201d says Tom. \"It also takes away a lot of the manual side of reporting that often left room for errors, and overall leads to a better experience for the people and organisations we partner with.\u201d"

        "title": "Florida International University increases graduation rates by 10% with Tableau",
        "company": "Florida International University",
        "content": "Florida International University (FIU) is one of the largest universities in Florida and provides a world-class education to local minority and Hispanic students. Many of its almost 60,000 enrolled students have overcome challenging situations; they lived in low-income areas and were sometimes the first generation to attend college or live in the U.S., seeking a college degree to support a brighter future. With state performance funding appropriation changes in 2014, funding for operations and academic programs was now based on 10 student and university performance metrics (e.g. post-graduate employment, school access or services) instead of just student enrollment. If overall performance placed them in the top three, they received more funding. FIU needed a deeper understanding of their data to ensure they were hitting these metrics. They also used data to predict what made different groups of students more or less likely to succeed, and made it fully accessible for staff so they could understand what programs or procedures correlated to better performance. FIU used dozens of predictive data models from DataRobot with nearly 200 Tableau dashboards to convey timely insights about students to 10,000 members of university administration, faculty, and staff. FIU also used Tableau to deeply explore the factors that positively or negatively impacted the academic experience of all students\u2014whether you\u2019re a scholarship grantee or considered mainstream. Now staff understand what drives success for nearly 60,000 students and they modify processes or programs to maximize support and revert trends that put on-time graduation at risk. This resulted in a 10 percent increase of four-year graduation rates overall, nearly 50 percent of students (specifically Pell grantees) graduating in pace with or ahead of other universities, and improved FIU\u2019s ranking by more than 20 points to place them in second with Florida\u2019s performance funding metrics. To better assist its at-risk students, FIU wanted to shift to a forward-looking view of its data. With constrained staffing resources, they needed a scalable, intuitive solution that staff could use. Tableau made analytics more accessible to departments that can intervene in student\u2019s academics and support success, but pairing DataRobot\u2019s predictive analytics would help FIU uncover and avoid obstacles that put students at risk. \"The university and its image are being held responsible for how students interact with the university while they\u2019re here, and how well we can take students coming in and then produce educated graduates four years later,\u201d explained Paden Goldsmith, Assistant Director, Strategic Data Analysis. FIU analyzed many variables that correlate to student success and reversed potential threats using Tableau and DataRobot. \u201cIt was really a beacon of guidance that we provided to people in the trenches and being held accountable for things like student behavior, making sure they\u2019re enrolled in the classes that they need, and achieving milestones during academic progression,\u201d shared Dr. Hiselgis Perez, Associate Vice President, Analysis and Information Management. Variables that influence student performance include course difficulty, proximity to the university (the further away, the higher the percentage of dropouts), and how well they\u2019re transitioned between advisors during college. With Tableau dashboards deployed across campus, university leadership can see a complete view of academic and student data, but a dean or department chair can filter and access other data shared on the Tableau Server so the Office of Analysis and Information Management doesn\u2019t have to build or maintain separate reports. \u201cThe way that Tableau helps us, it\u2019s by far the most effective and user-friendly way to disseminate analysis on a large scale to multiple individuals in a way that they can customize it to meet their own needs,\u201d explained Dr. Perez. Faculty now have actionable, department-specific information in-hand to modify programs and procedures that improve the academic success of at-risk students. Now, FIU provides a tailored experience from admissions through enrollment to address all students\u2019 educational needs. This improved retention and graduation rates by more than 10 percent since 2018. They\u2019re also applying more intense advising techniques and better curriculum management to improve student employability after graduation. FIU tried other business intelligence solutions, but the technical knowledge needed to use them, plus fragmented data sources, made it tricky for staff to monitor factors that influence performance with state funding metrics, and correlate with student success. \u201cEven if you learned the tool, there were so many settings and clicks that you had to do to make the simplest thing,\u201d Dr. Perez added. With DataRobot extensions for Tableau, FIU\u2019s analytics team could rapidly experiment with different scenarios to identify the best strategies for intervention\u2014all without using a single line of code. Tableau Server connects to and integrates hundreds of data sources with millions of records; it\u2019s refreshed and ready in the first half hour of each day. Campus staff access the predictive analytics through an internal portal. \u201cThe timeliness of it is the biggest advantage that we have, and the fact that it\u2019s not a black box. We know what the variables are going into it. And we know which variables are more predictive, whereas with proprietary solutions, you don\u2019t understand what puts a person at high risk and how to fix it,\u201d said Dr. Perez. Now staff from the advancement to research departments continue business as usual, but share and access information entirely or as part of a specially created extract to suit their needs. Instead of not being able to forecast the impact of initiatives on metrics, FIU now uses analytics to model scenarios and see what will have the best impact. Tableau has bridged data science and business analytics to positively influence the school\u2019s performance with state funding metrics and accelerate FIU\u2019s ranking as one of the top public universities in Florida. Furthermore, with automated, self-service analytics, FIU\u2019s Analysis and Information Management team eliminated IT contracts with third-party providers to save the university millions of dollars. Doing so has shifted attention to developing new, creative innovations that serve the university better; such as qualitative analytics tools that reflect student feedback or What-If based tools for strategic planning with school rankings."

        "content": "With a subscriber base of over 40 million people and annual revenue of US$248 million, Advanced Info Service (AIS) is Thailand\u2019s largest mobile operator. The telecommunications giant, founded in 1986, also specialises in fixed broadband and digital content like entertainment, gaming and business cloud services. Its decision to adopt Tableau in 2016 was led by Dr. Gwynponq Chatranon, Head of Data Management and Big Data Analytics \u2013 a move that has allowed the company to collect data more efficiently, mine this data better, and foster a culture of innovation to prepare itself for the future. Before Tableau, AIS faced a big hurdle in driving digital transformation across the organization: while it had a robust data collection process, not all of its employees were privy to key business and operational insights. Business intelligence programs, for example, could only be operated by those with deeper technical knowledge, leaving others to rely on tools such as spreadsheet applications. As a result, decisions were often made based on different sources of information, with gaps in productivity among the various employees. \u201cWith just some people capable of using complex software, it was difficult to transform AIS into a data-driven organization,\u201d Dr. Gwynponq recalled. But embracing Tableau\u2019s user-friendly capabilities have enabled more employees to optimize the use of data and make decisions more efficiently. In an industry that moves as rapidly as telecommunications, AIS, which accounts for nearly half the market share in Thailand, has stayed ahead of the competition by relying on its ability to forecast trends. Even then, static data that was used during meetings often hampered the group\u2019s speed when it came to making decisions. For example, its Data Warehouse team used to take days to process the relevant information when top executives asked for business insights \u2013 a delay that cost the company to miss a few business opportunities. And when available, the data was typically presented in a bland format that was tedious to go through. \u201cImagine the executives who had to read all 40 pages of a report before making a decision,\u201d said Dr. Gwynponq. The adoption of Tableau enabled the team to create and deliver interactive presentations, with data being visualized on a dashboard in a reader-friendly and digestible manner \u201cWhen executives want information, the team is now able to look for insights, and present and compare the performance of the products,\u201d said Dr. Gwynponq. \u201cThat has resulted in much faster and effective decision-making.\u201d With technology disrupting virtually every industry, including telecommunications, companies have to adopt a forward-looking stance \u2013 starting with the employees. For AIS, incorporating Tableau has not only improved its data visualization process but also inspired employees to adopt an innovative, analytics-based mindset. To foster a data culture, the company worked closely with Tableau to introduce various data analytics and visualization programs for its employees since 2017. This includes workshop series as well as the annual AIS Analytics Day which brought employees together to share their best ideas birthed out of data insights."

        "content": "As part of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy, the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) is the Federal Government's central geoscientific advisory body. In a special project within the \"Extractives and Development\" sector programme, which is financed by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, BGR employees analyse the expenditure structure of copper and cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia , the so-called Copper belt. The aim is to visualize the local demand volumes tangible for the individual purchase categories of the mines so that the political leaders of these states, but also local and international suppliers, can derive actionable recommendations from them. With Tableau, the BGR team analyses the annual purchasing volume of the mining companies since 2013 in 34 product and service categories. The results are available to all interested parties in the form of interactive graphics and evaluations using Tableau Public on various websites. The resulting estimation of purchasing volumes in the various categories and markets enables local politicians to implement their localization efforts and infrastructure planning in a more targeted and thus more efficient manner, allows mining companies to better understand their procurement activities and optimize their supplier strategies, and provides potential local and international mining suppliers with information on worthwhile investment areas in order to develop them alone or in the form of joint ventures. As part of its development policy commitment to local value creation in the raw materials sector, the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) developed a model for identifying local investment opportunities in raw materials projects. The LION (Local Investment Opportunities in Natural resources projects) tool analyses data from a field study conducted in the summer of 2018 on the cash operating costs of copper and cobalt mines in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo and their percentage allocation to 34 specific purchasing categories such as energy, water, fuel and lubricants, spare parts and equipment, sulphur and sulphuric acid, abrasives, maintenance and repair, tyres, construction and related services, food and beverages, personnel services or telecommunications. The total purchasing volume examined amounts to over US$ 5 billion annually and represents an enormous economic potential for local and international suppliers in the Copperbelt. In addition, copper and cobalt are indispensable elements of the global energy transition. Their cost-effective production is therefore of a global concern. \"The LION tool blends together publicly available data on mine production volumes and cash operating costs with the cost split, that is the percentage spent on 34 different product categories\u201d explains Nils Handler, research associate at BGR. Prior to using Tableau, the BGR sector program had to send around various excel-sheets containing this type of information. Apart from being a very cumbersome process, the reach of this type of dissemination was very limited, reaching only a relatively small number of beneficiaries. \"The graphical exploration of complex data often provides important insights at first glance. Geo-referencing of mines on maps for example is very insightful. It is one example of an appealing data visualization, which anybody with an internet connection can access. Having reached more than 1200 hits on our Tableau Public visualizations for the Copper Belt, and half that number for our gold model for West Africa evidences the increased reach of our work outputs. The LION tool developed by the sector program 'Extractives and Development' delivers modelled market data and context information via BGR's Tableau Public platform. It can be efficiently updated with new cost data and is easy to use. Users can interactively select different years, countries or specific categories to explore them in detail. Governments, private companies and support agencies better understand the scope and nature of the markets for mine products and services using the LION model's estimates of procurement costs. As a result local politicians can identify the most promising product categories in terms of volume and logistics for their localization efforts. This allows them to use limited public resources for projects with the highest expected return on investment. This knowledge can also be used to better plan and execute investments in utilities, roads and other infrastructure. The tool provides local suppliers with an estimate of the size of various procurement markets, their evolution over time and potential risk factors. The LION tool can help coordinate different suppliers so that they spread out their activities across different product categories instead of all competing for the same share of the pie. A comparison of their product range with the procurement demand categories helps to identify business opportunities in existing or new procurement markets and to assess their prospects of success. LION also provides international suppliers with an overview of the size and segmentation of demand markets, providing them with indications of an effective bidding strategy, promising joint ventures or promising investments. Donors and public institutions, such as chambers of commerce, industry associations or commercial banks, can use the tool as part of their investment decisions or to focus their support programmes. LION provides mining companies with a better understanding of the overall market for various procurement products and services in a given country. This helps them plan and implement efficient supplier strategies, create opportunities for potential cost savings by shifting to local suppliers, and encourage the formation of purchasing associations with other mine operators to increase their market power and achieve savings through larger purchasing volumes. Overall, the availability of the BGR's new analyses has been well-received by different audiences when presented at international mining conferences and the OECD, as well as senior policy makers. This is shown by the feedback in many personal discussions between the Extractives and Development sector programme and government officials as well as representatives from the industry. \"Since the LION tool is available via the Internet on various websites, the access rates have increased tenfold,\" reports Nils Handler on the enormous increase in reach. \"Policy makers even expressed the wish to properly manage the tool under their own direction. Currently we are planning to include Congolese gold mining into the LION model.\u201d"

Tibadee Suraswadi, Head of Analytics Solutions, Analytics Business, adopted Tableau to help clients better make sense of and manage the information. What the firm saw was a significantly optimized sales cycle that boosted revenue and relationships with clients that were more meaningful. In the fast-moving digital marketplace, companies need to seize growth opportunities promptly. But analyzing and drawing useful insights from data can be time-consuming. To speed up the process, Tibadee used Tableau to customize the use of data according to each client\u2019s needs. This allowed their clients to look at key operational insights from different angles instead of static slides filled with unintelligible numbers. They were then able to interact with the data and enter into a productive dialogue with True Digital on how to improve their services. Having more of such productive discussions has cut the sales cycle for True Digital by half, providing a significant boost to revenue. \u201cTableau\u2019s biggest advantage for us is the ability to do customization at scale. First, we build a standard template that answers important business questions. Then, we customize it to suit every client\u2019s needs,\u201d said Tibadee. Before Tableau, True Digital used to engage clients over long presentations and meetings, where they would both pore over static slides and reports with large amounts of numbers. But this also meant several meetings were required to resolve one issue, for instance. To build more productive discussions, Tibadee swapped presentations for creative workshops, where clients could interact with critical insights that True Digital prepared using the Tableau software. This allowed True Digital to have \u201cvery dynamic and meaningful conversations\u201d with its clients, and better address their needs. \u201cThe flexibility and agility of the Tableau dashboard allow us to look at the client\u2019s issues in a very comprehensive manner and resolve them in just one workshop \u2013 much more efficient than the traditional way,\u201d Tibadee shared. \u201cWhat\u2019s also interesting is there is always an element of surprise because there are times our clients will discover something we did not foresee, through their interactions with Tableau.\u201d Where oil once dominated the global economy, data is king today. But Tibadee believes that like oil, data is useless \u201cunless processed and used appropriately\u201d. Faced with vast amounts of data to mine and transform into impactful insights, True Digital needed a way to communicate complex datasets and insights to clients in an accessible manner. \u201cImagine how difficult it would be to try to explain how logarithmic-based propensity model coefficients relate to marketing investment decisions. It\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said. With Tableau, complex insights became a thing of the past. The software\u2019s visualization tool represented data in interactive, simple-to-understand graphs and charts that were, at the same time, \u201cbeautiful and visually appealing\u201d, often leaving clients in awe. Tibadee also encouraged clients to adopt Tableau to drive digital transformation within their organizations. \u201cOver time, our clients also picked up basic analytics functions on Tableau because it is so easy to use,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to create long-term value for our clients. Instead of giving them a fish each day, we hope we can eventually teach them the skill of fishing for insights in the sea of data.\u201d"

        "company": "Pruksa Real Estate Public Company Limited",
        "content": "With projects spanning across Thailand, India and the Maldives, Pruksa is one of the biggest real estate and construction companies in Asia, raising US$1.47 billion in total revenue in 2018. The company, founded in 1993, stands out in an industry dominated by traditional practices for its forward-looking use of data, which has helped it edge ahead of the competition. Pruksa\u2019s Head of Data Nassal Leehard said Tableau has boosted the reporting of construction progress and enhanced understanding of customer behavior \u2013 an \u201cintuitive and fast software\u201d that has helped translate big data and machine learning into tangible benefits for the business. Property developers often face one problem in sales: they pour in large sums into marketing efforts and build exquisite showrooms, only to find that showroom crowds do not correspond to sales figures. \u201cIt has become a pain point when people visit our projects but leave without buying,\u201d said Nassal. This may well be happening because customers are viewing an unsuitable property for their individual profile and needs, and are unable to commit to a purchase, as a result. To better rake in sales, Pruksa now uses Tableau to organize customer information, to match the right project to the right client. The data is sorted according to key metrics that range from the loan amount that a customer can receive based on his income and his marital status to which departmental store he frequents. In a market as competitive as real estate, peripheral information like these make up a small advantage that can add up to big wins. \u201cThis customer behavior is recorded to develop a machine-learning model. We then analyze it so that we can find the best project for our clients,\u201d Nassal said. For a large real estate developer like Pruksa, keeping tabs on multiple construction sites to ensure all projects are delivered on time is critical. After all, delays mean additional costs and are likely to put a dent in a good reputation that has been carefully honed over the years. With Tableau, construction progress reporting at the company has become faster and neater, while precious manpower has been freed up from menial tasks to do higher-value work. For instance, after collecting data by flying drones over construction sites, Pruksa can now analyze the data when it is inputted into Tableau. This allows it to distinguish between greenfield and brownfield sites, and to ascertain the overall progress of construction. \u201cThis is instead of having someone survey the site, take notes and analyze in Excel, which will consume so much time,\u201d said Nassal. Tableau\u2019s intuitive interface cranks up the speed further by allowing employees to extract data much faster than before. \u201cBefore adopting Tableau, our system was quite slow, and the data we got was not up-to-date and inconsistent. The data was unusable,\u201d Nassal said. \u201cSo we started to look for a tool to solve such issues \u2013 to make data consistent, more real-time and with a more analytic approach. We found it in Tableau.\u201d In the real estate business, safety and customer service is paramount. As part of its after-sales service, Pruksa takes care to address home defects that have been reported and to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again. It is also typically a laborious process that requires an expert to attend to defects one at a time and manually categorize it, before writing a report. Tableau has simplified and sped up this process by crunching data collected on defects. Using photos of defects \u2013 such as decaying concrete, broken windows or damaged door knobs \u2013 Pruksa is able to use the software\u2019s machine learning capabilities to analyze the cause of such defects, attribute it accordingly to the consumer or supplier, and categorize it based on an extensive database. This has improved the firm\u2019s construction and delivery processes greatly. Nassal said: \u201cA study found that by 2030, AI could replace as much as 14 per cent of human labor. With the vision of our executives, Pruksa intends to focus on big data and machine learning to maximize the benefit for the company.\u201d"

        "content": "Uniper generates, trades, and markets energy on a global scale. Based in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany it ranks among the largest generation and trading companies in Europe, combining a balanced portfolio of technologically advanced large-scale assets with outstanding technical and commercial expertise. At the beginning of 2018, the company completed a major data infrastructure overhaul, which saw the existing data warehouse approach replaced by its new \u2018Atonyx\u2019 data platform that combines the flexibility of a data lake with the powerful analytics capabilities of Tableau. The company\u2019s agile approach to data reporting and analytics has cut time to insight by up to 50 percent over traditional BI solutions, boosting revenues through better intelligence and fostering a data-driven culture amongst employees. It has also made Uniper a more attractive company to work for amongst young technology graduates, encouraging fresh talent to join the industry and alleviating the sector-wide pressures associated with an aging workforce. Today\u2019s power generation industry is an extremely competitive environment, where precise planning plays a pivotal role in maximising profitability. \u201cIn the past, many power stations would run for a significant amount of the year\u201d says Damian Bunyan, CIO of Uniper. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not uncommon for modern power stations to run for just a couple of hundred hours a year, based on periods of peak demand. As a result, when that demand does arise it\u2019s essential our plants are available to run.\u201d Fast, accurate market intelligence is key to this, providing a significant competitive advantage to those who can plan most effectively. Uniper uses Tableau to analyse a wide range of market variables in real-time, predict demand and schedule essential maintenance accordingly, meaning plants are always available when needed. \u201cUsing Tableau, we\u2019re able to scrape both proprietary and public data into rich visualisations and analyse everything side by side, for the most accurate intelligence possible,\u201d says Damian. \u201cThis includes everything from historical power usage and plant maintenance logs, to weather data and publicly available market information, all of which play a key role in predicting future power needs.\u201d Careful planning of maintenance and availability in Tableau helps Uniper generate profits in excess of \u20ac50 million per year. \u201cTableau allows us to compare data sets and monetise information around 50 percent faster than would be possible with legacy IT processes,\u201d says Damian. \u201cAs a result, we\u2019re better informed, better prepared, and able to capitalise on changing market conditions at incredibly short notice, which is exactly what we need to ensure the ongoing success of the business.\u201d Uniper\u2019s emphasis on data and the use of real-time intelligence to boost profitability has also made it an enticing place to work for data scientists and new, tech-savvy graduates. With the entire sector suffering from the effects of an ageing workforce, this injection of fresh talent offers a positive step towards long-term prosperity. \u201cThe work we\u2019re doing is attracting interest from a new generation of employees looking to work at the forefront of analytics and data intelligence, which is fantastic for our industry as a whole,\u201d says Damian. The company recently held a tech open day for undergraduate students, many of whom expressed a desire to start their careers with Uniper after seeing the opportunities available and the technology in use on the analytics side of the business. \u201cTools such as Tableau represent the cutting edge of analytics technology, which is what tech-savvy employees want to be working with day-in and day-out,\u201d says Damian. \u201cIn the past, many of them wouldn\u2019t have considered a career in the power industry, but once they see the direct impact their work could have on revenues across the company, it becomes a highly appealing prospect to them.\u201d Uniper currently has over 1,000 active Tableau users and Damian estimates this figure will top 1,500 by the end of 2019. The company runs regular training sessions, both in-house and in partnership with Tableau, helping users to learn new techniques and get even more from the platform than they already do. \u201cEvery day, more employees ask to be given access to Tableau,\u201d says Damian. \u201cWhen we announced our next round of training recently, we had over 120 responses in less than 72 hours. There\u2019s a real appetite amongst current and new users alike to grow their Tableau skills and self-serve their own data needs, which greatly benefits the organisation as a whole.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped counting the number of hours we\u2019ve saved using Tableau,\u201d concludes Damian. \u201cI remember meeting with the chief engineer of one of our power plants not too long ago. Using three PCs stacked on a desk, he was attempting to show the station manager the numbers from the previous day, but despite running the program overnight it was still displaying errors and not processing properly. I saw the same engineer again recently and he used Tableau to project the real-time data of every power station in the UK on a single laptop. Once we implement Tableau Mobile, he won\u2019t even need the laptop anymore!\u201d"

        "company": "Bayer Healthcare China",
        "content": "Bayer is a global Life Science company with a more than 150-year history and core competencies in the areas of health care and agriculture. Headquartered in Leverkusen, Germany, Bayer entered the Chinese market in 1882. At present, Bayer has 12 joint venture subsidiaries in China, with various types of products, along with a massive amount and diversity of data. In China, Bayer Healthcare Company Limited has a Pharmaceuticals Division, Consumer Health Division and Crop Science Division. David Wang, Head of Commercial Insights and Analytics Director, from the Pharmaceuticals in Bayer Healthcare Company Limited, shared how Tableau helped Bayer\u2019s medical and health care business development. the strong data integration capability of Tableau, Bayer formed a standardized business language within the company, significantly improving data-processing and decision-making efficiency. As a large global company, Bayer has a massive amount of internal and external data that needs to be integrated and analyzed. Facing a variety of massive user and sales data generated by different departments in business operations, Bayer was facing unified management challenges. According to David, Bayer Healthcare Company Limited started using Tableau Desktop in 2016, in three stages. From 2016 to 2017, the marketing department in Bayer used Tableau Desktop to develop reports with dozens of users. From 2017 to the end of 2018, the analytics department started using Tableau Server to generate analysis reports, with more than 1200 staff from different departments using it to share and see data. From the end of 2018 to present is the third stage, where Tableau has been transformed from a traditional report analysis tool to a better decision supporting platform.\nBayer Global has deployed Tableau as its global decision analysis platform, which forms a standardized business language that can measure performance and make operations management more transparent and efficient. Before Bayer started using Tableau, they would develop analysis reports on a certain product or brand with the data coming from different departments who had different data sources and analysis tools. It was difficult for the management team to form a comprehensive judgment and evaluation on the product according to all the reports from various departments. As a global enterprise, Bayer also needed to compare and analyze data reports from different countries and regions. Some reports took up to six months to generate. The data integration capabilities in Tableau helped Bayer solve this problem. With Tableau, they could integrate multiple data sources and achieve a comprehensive analysis. They were also able to reduce the data integration analysis report production period from six months to one month, and the department analysis report production period was shortened from three months to two weeks. With all this time savings, it helped to improve data-integration and decision-making efficiency. Tableau provides more analytical dimensions for data processing. In addition to describing how the statistics work, Tableau provides in-depth predictive and burst analysis to respond to rapidly changing market and competitive environments. Facing rapid changes in the pharmaceutical market policy, Bayer transformed professional knowledge into quantitative indicators through internal and external data integration analysis, taking a journey of intelligence and digitization, predicting the impact of policy changes on the market. At Bayer, Tableau has changed from a data integration tool to a decision support platform, no longer limited to the business department. David said, \u201cWe call Tableau a \u2018Smart Platform\u2019, which means a faster and smarter decision supporting platform. Through Tableau\u2019s predictive and scenario analysis, we can better evaluate how to achieve optimal results in the current uncertain market and competitive environment. Everyone can make faster, more agile, more targeted and more valuable decisions. It has become a habit for every manager to use Tableau every day.\u201d \u201cTableau Server encourages us to analyze data and develop reports through self-service, gradually leading to an impact of self-management,\u201d said David. While people may use Tableau as a self-service analytics tool, Bayer experienced a new way to operate and manage through Tableau. At present, the company management team uses Tableau\u2019s data visualization capabilities to manage business operations after setting the strategies and assessments of functional departments and business units, creating exceptional value for the company. Take the example of the Pharmaceuticals Division of Bayer - the KPI Score Card is a performance data evaluation system formed by the IT, performance and business departments. The dashboard platform reviews the different KPI indicators that are collected from these various departments. Business department staff can compare themselves with others as well as current, and past business status through KPI visualized report to identify and troubleshoot problems in real-time. Meanwhile, the management team can understand the business status of relevant employees, customer feedback and the execution of company strategies and regulations through data, thus forming a performance culture. As a result, employees have changed from self-service to self-management. The transparent policy development and management empowered the company with optimized operations from top to bottom. David expressed that the next trend is the digital transformation of enterprises, and Tableau will help companies improve their competitiveness through data as part of this evolution."

The Australian-owned company collects huge amounts of valuable data from its roads and since being introduced in 2016, Tableau has allowed it to go beyond the standard-data reporting tools into data analytics. Today, the firm can deep dive and explore its data assets to get greater insights into everything from what\u2019s happening on its roads to accident hotspots and customer behaviour.                             Transurban partners with governments to invest in new infrastructure and road upgrade projects\u2014fast-tracking projects that will benefit motorists and communities. With magnetic sensors built into its roads at every 200-meter mark, in every lane, the company has access to volumes of data on traffic flow. Prior to Tableau, it looked over these numbers on a simple Excel spreadsheet, which could support only a limited number of rows of data. It was \u201cimpossible to do any analysis on Excel beyond half a day\u201d, noted Michael. \u201cBut now we\u2019ve got tables with tens of billions of rows of data on our platform, which we use for our year-on-year analysis of traffic flow on any section of road. We couldn't visualize and analyze all this information until now.\u201d Using those insights, Transurban has also been able to pinpoint and monitor hotspots for accidents, while making subtle changes to those roads to improve safety.                             For a toll road operator, the gantry is possibly the most important piece of roadside equipment as it plays a critical role in keeping the roads running efficiently.\nTo identify equipment that has malfunctioned or are starting to break down, Transurban now has access to information that is updated every hour, allowing it to address equipment problems much faster. \u201cOur roads operate 24/7, and there\u2019s a significant amount of equipment required to keep the roads operating efficiently. Critical to this is our analytics platform, which ingests huge amounts near real-time data and provides operational dashboards on the status of our equipment across the nation,\u201d Michael said. \u201cReal-time information has enabled us to respond to equipment performance issues in a much timelier manner and ensure tolling operations are running effectively.\u201d"

        "company": "YIT",
        "content": "YIT is the largest construction company in Finland and one of the biggest in Northern Europe, generating annual revenues of \u20ac3.8 billion (2018). Founded in 1910, the company employs over 10,000 personnel across 11 countries and specialises in the development and building of residential and business premises, demanding infrastructure and paving. In 2016, YIT conducted a major restructure of its IT operations to make systematic, long term data collection central to its core business function for the first time. This included the implementation of a new, Azure cloud-based data warehouse that would power all types of analytics. After comprehensive piloting and research of analytics end user solutions, Tableau was selected and connected directly, and has been the primary analytics platform within YIT ever since. This new approach has given rise to a powerful data driven culture, with employees at all levels of the business able to self-serve many of their own analytics needs and use the insights discovered to inform key decision making. YIT also utilises Tableau Prep to quickly and efficiently clean and test complex new data sets before data platform implementation, most notably during the company\u2019s 2018 merger with Lemmink\u00e4inen Corporation, where it was used to combine two major HR and procurement data sources on the fly into Tableau for immediate analysis. Data plays a critical role in nearly every aspect of YIT\u2019s operations, but before 2016 there were no systems in place that allowed employees to self-serve their own data needs. Instead, all analytics had to be conducted via the company\u2019s centralised competence centre, leaving fewer possibilities for analysis at peak times. \u201cThe organisation was under constant pressure to deliver various reports across the business, from really simple stuff through to complex end of year analysis,\u201d says Heikki Sulonen, Senior Analytics Manager, YIT. \u201cThe company\u2019s strategy was to become more data-driven, with an emphasis on getting value from data. It was obvious that the analytics as a function needed to take a new direction from traditional BI towards modern business analytics.\u201d As part of the 2016 IT restructure, Heikki and his team looked at multiple different analytics platforms to solve this ongoing issue and quickly identified Tableau as the ideal solution for end user needs. \u201cTableau\u2019s usability and emphasis on visual analytics marked it out from the crowd early on,\u201d says Heikki. \u201cThe diversity of toolsets also meant it could be used across a wide range of departments, while Tableau Mobile makes access possible everywhere, regardless of whether users are in the office or on a construction site.\u201d With Tableau in place, hundreds of employees can now conduct much of their own data analysis every week, greatly improving productivity while reducing pressure on Heikki and his team. Regular basic and advanced training sessions encourage further uptake, while a bi-weekly Tableau clinic helps to solve any issues that arise. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to set up and start creating visualisations that users can go a long way on their own before needing our help,\u201d says Heikki. \u201cEverything is published in Tableau too, meaning the company has a single source of truth to work from rather than sending Excel spreadsheets around via email all the time.\u201d YIT\u2019s Tableau-based approach to analytics has also created a powerful new data driven culture throughout the company that didn\u2019t previously exist. \u201cEmployees are really interested in data and what they can do with it now,\u201d says Heikki. \u201cMany of them didn\u2019t really know what was possible before, but Tableau has brought a new level of accessibility that\u2019s got everyone excited.\u201d Heikki attributes much of this to Tableau\u2019s visual approach and intuitive interface, meaning new users can pick it up quickly and start creating dashboards that yield genuine insights right away. Unique users building dashboards and interacting with data grows on average by 100% every 6 months. \u201cAnalytics is much more attractive now,\u201d says Heikki. \u201cUptake of Tableau has grown organically as well, as people in all departments recommend it to their colleagues.\u201d The use of embedded dashboards across YIT\u2019s intranet also means that in some cases employees don\u2019t even realise they are using it. \u201cTableau has quickly become ingrained in the fabric of our operations,\u201d says Heikki. \u201cAnalytics is no longer a complex or laborious task, but something that can be done on the fly to inform decision making and boost day-to-day efficiency.\u201d Another key aspect of Tableau that Heikki and his team were keen to take advantage of was its uniform tools and templates, which have allowed them to create a consistent, professional look across all reporting taking place throughout YIT for the first time. \u201cBefore Tableau it was extremely hard to ensure reporting consistency,\u201d says Heikki. \u201cMany employees were operating in local silos and creating Excel reports that maybe made sense to them but not anyone else.\u201d \u201cNow, everyone is working from a single source of truth and delivering both internal and external reports that all have the same look and feel, from the colours and fonts to the headers and graphics used.\u201d In 2018, YIT completed a major merger with another Finnish construction company; Lemmink\u00e4inen Corporation. As part of the merger, all of Lemmink\u00e4inen\u2019s key data had to be cleaned and combined with YIT\u2019s, so it could be added to the cloud-based database and then connected to Tableau for future analytics purposes. \u201cWe took over the HR and procurement data,\u201d says Heikki. \u201cWith the help of Tableau Prep we were able to provide the business with critical information of the merged company in no time.\u201d Such tasks can often take many years to complete, but Heikki and his team were able to be much more agile and create an initial solution over disparate systems for immediate business results, which would also serve as a long-term data engineering guideline. \u201cIn situations like this, the separate data sources can often be wildly different in terms of scope, quality and consistency, making the task extremely difficult,\u201d says Heikki. \u201cFortunately, we were able to use Tableau Prep to merge the HR and procurement data quickly, cleaning, shaping and combining both sets of data for easy consolidation in Tableau. We saved huge amounts of time and money in the process.\u201d As a result, critical information from both companies, such as head count, can now be viewed as one in Tableau, making life a lot easier for the newly combined HR department. Prep is also used in other areas of the organisation to test the flow of data coming from multiple different vendors and make everything accessible via a handful of comprehensive Tableau dashboards. \u201cTableau Prep played a key role in the success of the recent merger and continues to be an invaluable part of our day-to-day operations,\u201d says Heikki. \u201cIt offers a really flexible first line solution whenever people require it. It allows us to maximise our operational efficiency by empowering employees with all the information they need to perform to the best of their ability, at all times.\u201d"

Founded in 2009 as mytaxi, the company employs 750 staff across 26 offices and works with over 100,000 drivers as part of its European network. In 2014, FREE NOW (then mytaxi) made Tableau its sole data analytics and visualisation tool, unifying multiple fragmented data sources and creating a single source of truth from which all employees can self-serve their analytics needs. Doing so has greatly improved trust in data and enabled more informed decision making at all levels of the company. Tableau\u2019s scalability has also allowed it to grow rapidly alongside mytaxi, from 15 users in 2014 to 450 in 2019, without compromising speed or consistency of analysis in any way. When FREE NOW was first founded as mytaxi in Hamburg, Germany in 2009, the local nature of operations meant that data-based decision making was relatively simple. However, as the company rapidly expanded its operations across Europe over the next five years, stemming from an acquisition by Daimler Mobility Services GmbH in 2014, data and personnel became increasingly fragmented. \u201cDecision makers were no longer in one room and local data silos were springing up everywhere, making everything much harder to control and coordinate,\u201d says Andrew Emmett, Head of Analytics at FREE NOW. \u201cThe bigger the company got, the lower the alignment across departments was becoming and the harder it was to make fast, accurate, business decisions.\u201d This rapid growth was also causing problems with the company\u2019s underlying data infrastructure, which was unable to keep up with the pace of expansion. So in 2015, the company conducted a significant infrastructure overhaul, replacing its existing monolithic system with a 100 percent cloud-based system, underpinned by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Tableau was then implemented as the sole data analytics layer, creating a single source of truth for the whole company to work from. \u201cStraight away, we had a new level of scalability and control throughout our operations that simply wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cWith a fully flexible system based in AWS, we can handle seasonal spikes in demand and the resulting data processing much more easily. Tableau then integrates seamlessly into this, ensuring everyone in the company can see and work from the exact same data sets, no matter where they are geographically.\u201d Tableau\u2019s intuitive interface also makes complex data easier to understand, analyse and visualise, even with only basic training. As more and more employees realise they can now self-serve their own data analytics needs, usage throughout the company has increased dramatically. In the last five years, the number of Tableau users has grown by over 2000%, from 15 (around 10% of the workforce) in 2014, to over 400 today (more than 50% of the workforce). \u201cWe have Tableau users in nearly every department now, where it has quickly become an invaluable tool for fast self-service analytics,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cUses range from customer engagement monitoring in our product teams, to KPI and budget tracking in our finance team and campaign performance assessment in marketing.\u201d For Andrew, one of Tableau\u2019s key attributes is its ability to scale alongside FREE NOW, allowing new users to be added whenever needed, without compromising speed or consistency of data analysis. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown very fast in the last five years, which could have caused major issues without the right tools in place\u201d says Andrew. \u201cTableau\u2019s flexibility has allowed us to grow unconstrained in this regard, it works just as well with 400 users as it does with 20.\u201d A good example of this was when mytaxi merged with Hailo, the leading taxi hailing app in the UK and Ireland, in 2016. \u201cFollowing the merger, mytaxi\u2019s workforce jumped from 250 to 400 almost overnight,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cWhen that happened, we were able to have the first new employees up and running with their own user accounts on Tableau in just 5 weeks.\u201d Tableau\u2019s built in governance and control tools also provide the right balance of freedom and control. \u201cThe aim of any organisation is to equip employees with tools that give them the freedom to do their jobs quickly and flexibly, but to also control those tools in order to maintain consistency,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cTableau lets us set the rules and create a controlled playground that can be trusted to produce accurate analysis and intelligence at all times.\u201d As a product, Tableau has also grown alongside FREE NOW, meaning Andrew has never been in a position of wanting functionality that Tableau can\u2019t provide. \u201cAs the business has evolved over the years, so too has Tableau,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cThere have been many occasions when we\u2019ve realised new functions such as level of detail calculations or cross database joins would be really beneficial to us, only to find they are included as part of the latest Tableau update.\u201d Tableau\u2019s advanced analytics and visualisation capabilities have helped FREE NOW uncover previously hidden data insights and use them to refine its European business operations. One of the key areas where this has happened is in the creation of service boundaries for the cities where the company operates. \u201cIn each of our cities we use historical ride data to define the area of service and ensure the best experience possible for both our customers and drivers,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cIn Tableau we can visualise all of this data on a heatmap, which clearly shows where the majority of journeys take place. Once this is done, we can quickly identify the point at which the provision of service is no longer viable from a business perspective.\u201d A particular benefit to Andrew was the fact the Tableau dashboard used for this process only had to be built once and could then be rolled out across every city involved, rather than building a new one from scratch every time. \u201cUsing Tableau for key operational activities like this saves time and also helps us make more informed operational decisions,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cAs a result, all our drivers benefit from higher passenger frequencies, while customers enjoy shorter wait times and better quality of service overall.\u201d"

        "company": "Dentsu Aegis ",
        "content": "Dentsu Aegis Network is the first global marketing services group built for the digital economy. Headquartered in London, the company helps clients build valuable relationships across the entire customer journey, with services like communications strategy, media planning and buying, content creation, brand tracking and marketing analytics. In 2016, the company\u2019s marketing analytics department started a program to develop more advanced dashboards, to help internal and external teams make better data-driven decisions, using Tableau. The goal was to combine client analytics data from numerous separate marketing channels into a single \u2018Heartbeat\u2019 report, breaking down data silos and reducing the longest delivery time from six weeks to just three days. Doing so has had a valuable impact on both client relationships and collaboration, as well as strengthening the data driven culture throughout Dentsu Aegis. One of the key services that the Dentsu Aegis data teams offer clients is detailed marketing analytics in key areas such as brand awareness and campaign recognition. These insights help clients to accurately measure overall brand health, understand ROI and deliver effective future campaigns. In the past, much of this analytics was based on brand health metrics from survey data that was manually collected, processed and compiled into numerous static reports, each focusing on a different area of marketing activity. However, the survey data\u2019s heavy focus on traditional channels, such as TV and print, made it hard to understand the effect of digital channels. Furthermore, the delivery of key findings in up to 10 separate reports made it difficult for clients to see the whole picture in a clear and concise way. \u201cA new approach was needed to reduce time-to-insight for our clients, as well as create a more comprehensive overview of the entire marketing funnel, not just the top\u201d says Lisette Hagenaars, market research team lead for Dentsu Aegis in the Netherlands. In order to achieve this, the company created the \u2018Heartbeat\u2019 reporting tool, taking the information spread around in different data sources and combining it all into a single, fully interactive Tableau dashboard. Rather than relying solely on survey data, Lisette and her team also integrated data from tools such as Google Analytics and Salesforce in Tableau, along with data from in-house systems from each client. The result was a \u201csingle source of truth\u201d dashboard, that combined offline and online data to show the trickle-down effect of media spends on the entire customer journey \u201cFor the first time, advertisers had all relevant data in one place,\u201d says Ingrid Pino, senior visual analytics specialist at Dentsu Aegis. \u201cNot only that, but Tableau\u2019s interactive interface allowed them to drill down into the trends and growth variations, helping them to quickly understand how different marketing activities affected brand awareness, perception and purchasing decisions.\u201d Tableau, combined with improvements in the survey process, has helped Dentsu Aegis move from quarterly reporting to much more regular updates. \u201cEverything is much closer to real-time now than was previously possible\u201d, says Lisette. \u201cThis allows our teams and clients to react faster and maximise ROI on their marketing spends.\u201d The new Heartbeat dashboard is significantly more engaging than the original slides reports, resulting in a new collaborative approach to data analytics emerging with multiple clients. \u201cThe interactive nature of Tableau, combined with its highly visual presentation, means clients can get far more involved with their data than before,\u201d says Lisette. \u201cThis has encouraged them to work much closer with us on exactly what metrics are needed in their Heartbeat to produce the insights they really want.\u201d Clients can also self-serve many of their own analytics needs directly in Tableau now, speeding up time to insight whilst reducing reliance on the Dentsu Aegis data teams to provide every piece of analysis. \u201cBy quickly changing a few parameters in their Heartbeat dashboard, clients can accurately compare KPI trends or year-on-year results,\u201d says Ingrid. \u201cPreviously they would have needed to come to us for this information, but with Tableau they can do it themselves in just a few clicks.\u201d In addition to client benefits, the adoption of Tableau has also had a number of benefits on the way Dentsu Aegis works internally. \u201cPreviously, many of the teams would have a tendency to work in silos,\u201d says Lisette. \u201cIn particular, the offline and online media planning teams would work separately to one another, meaning there was little crossover of knowledge between the two.\u201d \u201cWith Tableau, everyone has a central data platform through which to connect and collaborate, breaking down many of these silos and strengthening our company\u2019s data driven culture.\u201d The Heartbeat dashboard projects have also resonated throughout the entire Dentsu Aegis global network, with Lisette and Ingrid receiving enquiries about it from teams all over the world. \u201cWe\u2019ve been approached by numerous different teams who want to create Heartbeat dashboards for their own clients. The combination of interactivity and visual presentation that Tableau provides really does make it stand out from the crowd, offering a genuinely engaging and different way to provide clients with key analytical insights about their business.\u201d \u2013 Ingrid"

        "content": "DataOrbis is a global IT solutions and intelligence provider specializing in helping businesses to break down data silos and transform themselves into data-driven organizations. Headquartered in Cape Town, South Africa, the company employs 82 staff and boasts a portfolio of international clients including Unilever, GlaxoSmithkline and Coca-Cola. DataOrbis began using Tableau in 2013 to make its client reporting much more visual and interactive than previously was possible using static PDFs. With 98% of reports now delivered through Tableau, clients can dive deeper into their data more than ever before and self-serve their analytics needs directly, cutting time to insight and boosting business performance. DataOrbis is passionate about data and how companies can use it to drive more efficient decision making across their operations. In order to achieve this, it has developed a proprietary cloud-based platform that collects, processes and enriches data from across a client\u2019s value chain, before compiling it into detailed intelligence reports containing real actionable insights. Prior to Tableau, these reports were presented back to clients via static PDFs. While sufficient for delivering headline information, they didn\u2019t allow for any sort of filtering or interaction with the data contained within them. As such, clients were unable to dive deeper than the surface of the reports or find the reasons behind key insights themselves. \u201cUsing PDFs for reporting really didn\u2019t allow clients to delve into the data the way we wanted them to,\u201d says Nicola Lapage, Head of Insights at DataOrbis. \u201cWe knew a dedicated visualization and analytics platform would offer much greater interactivity for clients, allowing them to answer business questions and use data to better inform decision making.\u201d Following an extensive assessment of leading analytics platforms, DataOrbis implemented Tableau in 2013. \u201cTableau\u2019s functionality was the best of all those we reviewed, while the fact we could host the server on our side made it much more appealing,\u201d says Nicola. \u201cIts visual approach to analytics also allowed us to present a huge amount of data in a way that didn\u2019t overwhelm clients.\u201d Now, 98% of all DataOrbis reports are delivered through Tableau, allowing clients to interrogate every aspect of their data using intuitive dashboards and filters. Catherine Holmes, Insights and Innovation Manager at DataOrbis cites a large wholesale customer as a great example of this. \u201cIn a single report, the client is able to track 90,000 products across its manufacturers, regions and stores, using just three interactive dashboards,\u201d says Catherine. \u201cTableau also allows them to drill down into individual product lines in an easily digestible manner, without being drowned in tables of raw data.\" One of Tableau\u2019s biggest benefits is the way it allows clients to self-serve their own data needs, instead of relying solely on the Insights team at DataOrbis to do it for them. \u201cPrior to Tableau, if a client had any follow up questions about a report, they would have to come back to us and ask for additional reports to be generated,\u201d says Nicola. \u201cNot only did this put a lot of strain on the team here, but it could also take quite a long time to find the exact information they were looking for, causing delays in providing it.\u201d Clients can now answer many of these questions themselves, directly within the Tableau platform. \u201cTableau\u2019s intuitive interface and interactive capabilities are helping to drive a self-help model throughout all our clients,\u201d says Catherine. \u201cOnce they are set up on the platform, they can slice and dice their data any way they like, leading to much faster answers than previously possible.\u201d When DataOrbis was first founded, technology limitations meant it was only able to batch process client data once per month and there was a three-week lag in report turnaround time. As a result, the information contained within its intelligence reports was up to one month out of date by the time the clients received them. Over time, the introduction of new technology has significantly cut this delay and DataOrbis can now provide reports to clients on a daily basis. Soon the company plans to move to real-time reporting, with Tableau playing a key role in enabling this. \u201cNow, with Tableau plugged into our cloud platform, clients have a direct window to their data at all times. As we migrate to a live service model in the future, whatever information we can see, our clients will be able to see as well.\u201d For Nicola and Catherine, Tableau\u2019s extensive global community has played a major role in its success at DataOrbis. \u201cBack in 2013, we were one of the first companies in South Africa to adopt Tableau, so there weren\u2019t many local experts available to us at the time,\u201d says Nicola. \u201cBut whenever we ran into an issue, all we had to do was reach out to Tableau\u2019s online community and within no time at all we had the answers we were looking for.\u201d The Tableau community has also helped Nicola and Catherine to formulate training plans for DataOrbis staff and clients, as well as advance their own knowledge of the platform. \u201cOur Tableau support network now extends all over the world, from Canada to the UK and beyond,\u201d says Catherine. \u201cThere\u2019s always something new for us to learn, while online resources such as Viz of the Day help us generate ideas and develop innovative new ways to visualize data for our clients.\u201d"

        "content": "Founded in 2013, carwow is a unique online platform for consumers that takes the frustration out of buying new cars from franchised dealers in the UK, Germany and Spain. It uses the reverse marketplace model, which removes the need for buyers to negotiate with car sellers directly. Instead, they can choose the car they want on carwow and receive competitive offers directly from dealers. Headquartered in London, the company employs 220 staff across three countries. carwow recently completed a major data infrastructure overhaul that saw its legacy data warehouse and BI tools replaced with a combination of Snowflake, Fivetran and Tableau. This flexible new approach to data has yielded a wealth of benefits including faster time to insight, greater scalability and lower costs, along with a much better understanding of customer behaviour at a granular level. As a result, carwow is perfectly positioned to continue its current growth trajectory as it looks to expand into new territories around the world. Data has played a pivotal role in carwow\u2019s business model from day one, but as the company grew, it found its original data systems were struggling to cope with the extra demand being placed on them. Not only were important system syncs taking longer to perform but increasing fragmentation of data sources and a lack of standardised analytics/reporting tools was causing confusion amongst employees and making it hard to identify important business insights quickly. \u201cWe needed to simplify operations, switch off unnecessary tools and implement a central data platform that could easily scale alongside the company as it continues to grow,\u201d says Tim Hesse, Director of Data at carwow. This began with the migration of all company data to Snowflake and Fivetran, simplifying data management and greatly improving processing speed. \u201cSnowflake\u2019s flexibility and our ability to dedicate warehouses to ETL and reporting tasks vastly improved our BI processes. This was a significant early factor in accelerating our speed to insight,\u201d says Tim. Next, Tim trialled several analytics platforms to complete the stack, quickly identifying Tableau as the ideal solution for the company\u2019s needs. \u201cTableau\u2019s visualisation capabilities are what made it really stand out from the competition,\u201d says Tim. \u201cNot only could we create fast, accurate reports right from the start, but the highly visual approach added a new, exciting dimension to data analysis that simply didn\u2019t exist before.\u201d With the new data stack in place, all 220 employees are now working from a single source of truth for the first time, eliminating data silos and cutting time to insight by an average of 30 percent. Governance is controlled via Tableau permissions, giving everyone fast, convenient access to the information they need whilst ensuring sensitive data remains secure. \u201cWith Tableau, everything is done inside the platform and governed through a central certified & published data source,\u201d says Tim. \u201cAs a result, data analytics and reporting have become fast, convenient and more secure. Furthermore, everyone can be confident they are looking at the same information now, rather than having five different versions of a report or spreadsheet flying around on email and causing confusion.\u201d carwow\u2019s business is founded on a comprehensive understanding of customer buying behaviour and Tableau has allowed the company to take this to a whole new level of granularity. \u201cThe average customer takes around 60 days to buy a car, so it\u2019s quite a long purchase journey,\u201d says Tim. \u201cWith Tableau, we\u2019re able to track their behaviour on our website at every stage and really understand the key thought processes that go into the final purchasing decision.\u201d This information can then be presented back to the business in clear, interactive dashboards and visualisations that are tailored to their target audience. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a variety of views in Tableau that allow different levels of the business to quickly see the information they need to make informed decisions and tailor activity accordingly,\u201d says Tim. \u201cThis ranges from high-level business stats aimed at senior executives, through to detailed customer trends and insights for our sales and marketing guys, broken down by day, year and season, helping them fine-tune future campaigns for maximum effectiveness.\u201d The combination of Tableau, Snowflake and Fivetran means data within the dashboards are updated every day, so employees know they always have the latest information at their fingertips. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been obsessed with customer behaviour and for the first time we can truly indulge that obsession,\u201d says Tim. \u201cPrior to Tableau we were spending a lot of time on predictions, which always comes with a degree of guesswork. Now everything is much more factual, right down to the finest details, which is much more valuable to the business.\u201d The creation of a consistent central data source has also started to drive a powerful new data culture, with many employees now self-serving their own data needs instead of relying on the central data team. \u201cBefore, everyone would come to us for all their analytics needs, but now people are realising that it\u2019s a lot quicker and easier to do it themselves in Tableau,\u201d says Tim. \u201cIf the sales guys want to know how many potential customers visited the website between 4-6pm last Saturday, they can pull that information up in just a few clicks, making their jobs easier and saving us valuable time.\u201d Tim and his team also hold regular in-house Tableau training sessions to further encourage adoption throughout the company. \u201cThe Spanish team have just come on board, which is becoming transformational for them,\u201d says Tim. \u201cAs we look to expand into new territories in the near future, this data-driven approach will not only smooth the road ahead but ensure we\u2019re perfectly positioned to hit the ground running in every market we enter.\u201d"

        "content": "Tracing its roots back to 1862, Coopers Brewery stands as the most significant and only family-owned brewery in Australia today, well-loved for its naturally conditioned beers, ales and stouts. While the company is built on legacy, it has not been afraid of adopting new technology. In 2016, Brewing and Supply Chain Manager Jon Meneses gamely tapped on Tableau and data analytics to see how it could add value to the business. The result was several breakthrough insights that spurred growth and allowed the firm to make more informed, data-driven decisions \u2013 staying ahead of the curve. Beer wastage occurs at every stage of production, be it during filtration, the transfer of beer between vessels, or when the beer is packaged. And when the beer is lost, so is the opportunity for\ngenerating revenue. To track how much beer it was losing and where, Jon and his team tapped on Tableau to identify the root causes of wastage \u2013 and fix them. In the fermentation process, for instance, they found that one particular machine performed better than the others. Addressing the root causes of beer loss helped the company save 70% in potential revenue loss due to wastage, while continuously improving operations. \u201cDecision-making in the brewing industry has always been based on experience and gut feel,\u201d Jon said. \u201cBut data analytics helps you make informed decisions because data shows you in black and white what needs to happen based on what has been happening.\u201d Beer brewers everywhere face a common challenge: creating the right amount of creamy, white foam for their beer to look as good as possible when poured into a glass. To improve foam stability, Jon researched how various factors that affected froth levels in beer. He imported the results of his findings into Tableau, which put the data into charts and helped identify patterns and specific parameters behind the different levels of foam stability. What the charts showed, Jon shared was \u201cthis wonderful correlation\u201d between one particular measure, mash temperature, and foam stability in the beers. \u201cWe were blown away. It was a Eureka moment for us \u2013 the unveiling of a golden nugget of information that we didn\u2019t realize existed until Tableau,\u201d he said. The insights also helped the company optimize the brewing process and improve the quality of its beers. As a supply chain manager, Jon is often faced with the challenge of knowing what products need to be manufactured to meet market demands. He used to look through \u201cpages and pages of numbers\u201d \u2013 comprising more than 350 stock keeping units (unique codes assigned to various products) \u2013 which made it difficult to distil meaningful information. But Tableau changed that. Using the software, he created a dashboard that combined different data sources into \u201ca single source of truth\u201d. This allowed him and his team to access current stock levels quickly, historical sales, predicted demand, and how the company is performing against the budget \u2013 all at a single glance. He now uses the dashboard daily to make informed decisions about supply chain management. \u201cWe want to make sure our production capability can cover demand in the marketplace,\u201d Jon said. \u201cSo the Tableau dashboard gives me a good picture of whether we\u2019re doing well in terms of stock, or if we\u2019ve got too much inventory that would otherwise just add to capital costs.\u201d Assisting our clients in data driven technology projects, DataSpark Analytics specialise in Data Analytics, CRM, Marketing Automation and Cloud Infrastructure services.

        "company": "Garanti Bank ",
        "content": "Established in 1946, Garanti BBVA Bank is Turkey\u2019s second largest private bank with consolidated assets of nearly TL 385 billion (USD 84.3 billion). As an integrated financial services group, it operates in every segment of the banking sector including corporate, commercial, SME, payment systems, retail, private and investment banking. In 2017, Garanti BBVA Bank undertook an ambitious project to transform all 900 of its branches from traditional banking locations to digitally focussed customer service centres in just 18 months. To manage this change effectively, Garanti BBVA Bank used Tableau to break down internal data silos and create a single source of truth throughout the organisation. As a result, employees at every level were able to access and visualise project data, view KPIs and self-serve their own analytics needs whenever required. Following the successful completion of the project, Tableau is now used throughout Garanti BBVA Bank for effective big data analysis, helping to determine customer needs and behaviour, as well as monitoring branch performance from both an individual and overall perspective. When Garanti BBVA Bank decided to undertake the ambitious project of digitally transforming its 900 banking branches in just 18 months, the team in charge knew having a reliable, central data source for all stakeholders to work from would be pivotal to success. \u201cToday, 92% of the non-cash financial transactions in our bank take place via digital channels and we wanted our in-branch experience to reflect that,\u201d says Arzu Dilaver, Workforce Optimization and Service Quality Management Supervisor, Garanti BBVA Bank. \u201cDoing so involved a complete overhaul of our branches in terms of both physical layout and customer service model, creating a seamless digital experience that replicates the services customers are already embracing online.\u201d \u201cChange management is always challenging,\u201d adds Engin Kanal, Workforce Optimization and Service Quality Management Consultant, Garanti BBVA Bank. \u201cBut with such a tight timeframe in which to complete this project, every aspect of the process needed to be as streamlined as possible.\u201d Before Tableau, there was no central data analytics and business intelligence function within our department. With various different BI tools and databases in use, data was fragmented across multiple local silos, making it very hard to see the complete picture; something that would be critical throughout the transformation project. \u201cWe needed to bring everything together in one place,\u201d says Engin. \u201cDoing so would not only improve/inform decision making and help answer questions, it would also reduce conflict and allow all stakeholders, from senior executives to branch managers, to accurately monitor progress.\u201d Following an extensive review, Tableau was chosen as the primary analytics and reporting platform. In addition to unifying all disparate databases through a single, central location, its intuitive visual approach to analytics and rapid reporting capabilities made it ideal for Garanti BBVA Bank\u2019s needs. \u201cBy connecting Oracle, Microsoft SQL and a wide range of flat files and log files together through Tableau, we created a single source of truth for all employees, at every level of the organisation,\u201d says Arzu. \u201cAs a result, everyone involved in the project could log into the tool at any time and be confident the reports they were looking at were both relevant and up-to date.\u201d Tableau\u2019s ease of use also enabled employees from across the organisation to start self-serving many of their own analytics needs for the first time, rather than relying on the central analytics team to do it for them. \u201cIn a project like this one, the information that branch managers need is very different to what C-level executives need,\u201d says Engin. \u201cWhile branch managers are naturally more interested in progress at their own location, senior executives want to see the whole project overview and quickly understand any issues that may have arisen.\u201d \u201cPrior to Tableau, all of the updates and reports for these different groups would need to be created centrally, which was both time consuming and resource intensive,\u201d adds Arzu. \u201cNow, even colleagues with little to no SQL knowledge can quickly start to conduct their own analytics in Tableau, creating engaging reports and dashboards that focus on the project areas most important to them.\u201d Not only does this new approach save time for the central analytics team, it significantly speeds up time to insight for all parties involved because they no longer have to wait in line for reports to be created for them. Furthermore, Tableau\u2019s live connection to all key databases also means existing dashboards can be amended and updated much faster than previously possible. \u201cIn the past, it could take several days to make relatively minor updates to reports, simply because the back-end processing took so long to complete,\u201d says Engin. \u201cWith Tableau, it takes just a few hours, making time to insight even faster.\u201d Following the completion of the project, Tableau is now playing a key role in analysing and visualising the customer data collected each day across Garanti BBVA Bank\u2019s 900 branches. \u201cAfter such a large-scale transformation, it\u2019s vital for us to continually monitor customer behaviour in order to understand if they are happy with the new experience and are properly engaging with all the digital services being provided.\u201d Arzu cites the example of the new customer interfaces on in-branch computer terminals: \u201cFollowing recent updates, we wanted to know if customers understood the new terminal interface and menu correctly. To do this, we used Tableau to correlate the actions performed on the terminal against the original ticket the customer was issued then they came into the branch. For example, if a customer\u2019s ticket said they wanted to make a cash transaction, we analysed whether they selected that option on the new interface and were able to successfully complete the transaction, or if the action was abandoned mid-way through.\u201d This level of detailed analysis has helped Garanti BBVA Bank to helping to accurately monitor customer satisfaction levels following the transformation and continually make improvements to the service, wherever needed. \u201cTableau lets us go deeper into the data than ever previously possible,\u201d concludes Engin. \u201cAs a result, we are able to fine tune the services we offer and use key insights to make decisions that will benefit both the bank and our millions of customers for many years to come.\u201d"

Before Tableau, data has no single standardization and varies across different businesses. Victor Setya, Tokopedia\u2019s Head of Analytics, oversees Business Intelligence (BI) and data analytics, and ensures that data is being harnessed to drive innovation in the company, champion a data-driven culture across the enterprise, as well as build Tokopedia\u2019s core data platform to enable the business to get the most value from its data. Data has become a crucial part of Tokopedia\u2019s culture and business model. The company's data team acts as a consultant to the company\u2019s broader business and product teams. Since its introduction, Tableau has become Tokopedia\u2019s core data platform that empowers teams across the enterprise to make quicker, smarter decisions with data \u2013 from BigQuery to Tableau. Tableau has empowered Tokopedia to tap on data in several ways. First, it allows detailed monitoring of key business metrics with current and relevant data points. Second, it acts as a platform for the company\u2019s data team to deliver business users\u2019 requests with beautiful and clear visualisations that are easily understood by their intended audiences. Thirdly, Tableau has enabled a data culture across Tokopedia by encouraging business users to see and understand data for themselves. \u201cWe think self-service analytics is the best way to bring users closer to their data, rather than just consuming it,\u201d commented Setya. \u201cThis has helped to create a culture of data, where users have moved from being data-aware to being data-driven. There is still some way to go, but the key stakeholders in Tokopedia are all now data-driven.\u201d With the support of IT partner Cybertrend, around 90% of business decision-makers in Tokopedia has gained access and capabilities to analyze their data with Tableau. For Tokopedia, understanding its customers and what drives their purchase decisions remains key to its success. Since adopting Tableau, Tokopedia has been able to connect information from vital parts of the customer journey \u2013 from the moment a customer visits its platform, to the completion of a transaction. Equipped with this valuable insight, Tokopedia has been able to serve up relevant information to its customers to enrich their shopping experience on its platform, at each step of the journey. Feedback is also collected in real-time, enabling Tokopedia to improve on its platform and optimize the customer experience. \u201cWith all this information connected in Tableau, we have now a centralised, streamlined dashboard that shows the sales funnel from the beginning to the end,\u201d said Setya. \u201cIf we see a change in behaviour at any point in the funnel, we can look at the high-level data and then drill down into the detail. This has allowed us to find problems and make strategic decisions to optimise the customer journey.\u201d In the fast-moving marketplace of e-commerce, Tokopedia has been able to raise its competitive advantage through its use of data with Tableau. For instance, the company has created a \u2018single source of truth\u2019, which has led to consistency in the way data is being interpreted across multiple teams. This, in turn, has raised the levels of collaboration between various departments in Tokopedia to deliver on superior customer experiences on its platform. \u201cWhen we make decisions, we need facts, so using Tableau for analytics has contributed to the rapid growth of Tokopedia. Other organizations use data too, but it\u2019s what we do with our data (for our customers) that differentiates us,\u201d said Setya. \u201cNow, whenever we implement a new product or feature, we think about what is the data telling us.\u201d Tokopedia\u2019s next objective is to double-down on empowering more business users with access and capabilities to self-service analytics. The company recognizes that while doing so will allow the right people to ask the right questions of their data, a self-service analytics culture will also enable Tokopedia\u2019s data analysts to create even more value for the company, by focusing their time on solving more strategic challenges and areas for development. \u201cI think we have only just started on our journey,\u201d says Setya. \u201cOur goal is to empower all our decision-makers with access to data, so that they can interact with it and create business value. We are looking forward to moving to smart analytics because machine learning and AI will make data analytics a common-practice to our people. That's where we think the future of data will be.\u201d Cybertrend helps to bring data science into the heart of day-to-day industries\u2019 business. They combine domain knowledge with specialist technical skills to deliver high-impact analysis using data insights, predictive models and data-centric business advice."

        "title": "Cigna improves healthcare affordability, care for 95M customers with Tableau",
        "company": "Cigna",
        "content": "Cigna\u00ae delivers affordable, quality care to 95 million global customers through commercial health, dental, life, accident, and Medicare and Medicaid insurance products. Cigna relies on data from across the organization and from its Collaborative Care program to achieve its business goals of \u201cbetter health, better affordability, and better experience for patients and providers,\u201d said Paul Van Dorpe, Business Analytics Director at Cigna. In 2017, the company implemented Tableau as the visual analytics platform for its 550 Cigna Collaborative Care partner organizations in 32 U.S. states. Using Tableau, Cigna\u2019s analytics team reviews financial transactions, customer and provider data, creates meaningful reports, and shares them with partnering providers so they can offer better, more affordable patient treatment. After completing its 2018 survey of providers titled \u201cCCC Reporting Portal and Registration Process Survey,\u201d 41 percent of respondents indicated that they use the quarterly reports more frequently to understand patient history, diagnoses, and treatments. The reports help them determine who to follow up with for appointment reminders and when, and provide information for brief health updates, medication compliance reinforcement, and post-surgery recovery documentation. Tableau provided Cigna the flexibility to securely integrate multiple data sources with its existing data infrastructure and offer governed reports to Collaborative Care partners. To date, this has resulted in $145 million in medical cost savings, and annual per-patient savings of $120. With Tableau, Cigna also supports internal analysts who synthesize healthcare costs and data from more than 140,000 physician partners, helping keep the quality of care standards high for its 95 million customers. Relationships with primary care providers and specialists, clinics, and facilities who participate in Cigna Collaborative Care (CCC), plus the data from all of its insured customers, puts Cigna in a unique position to reveal insights for the best, most affordable treatment of patients. Cigna previously used Excel to analyze their multiple, disparate data sets. This created confusion about performance of Cigna\u2019s Collaborative Care participants and made it difficult for them to know if their industry-leading engagement, satisfaction, and experience levels were maintained or exceeded. Pre-Tableau, Collaborative Care providers took static legacy reports, adapted them, and sifted through data points to gain insights. But this workflow wasn\u2019t optimal, generated low engagement, created missed opportunities and made it difficult to positively influence patient outcomes. The analytics team audited 14 previous Collaborative Care reports to determine a go-forward strategy. \u201cWe try to build relationships with all of our ACO (Accountable Care Organization) partners by delivering new tools, and new reports that will enable them to focus on what\u2019s really important\u2014the health and well-being of their patient population,\u201d explained Jo Ann Bidwell, Business Analytics Manager at Cigna. Consequently, Cigna combined financial transactions, customer, provider, treatment, and other data in Tableau dashboards that \u201cmake the complex simple, which is our guiding approach for how we provide useful information,\u201d stated Paul. Performance monitoring is critical for tracking quality of care\u2014individually, as a practice, in comparison with peers\u2014and for understanding which measures have opportunities or require focus. The provider report card that is accessible in Cigna\u2019s secure Collaborative Care reporting portal is rooted in Evidence Based Medicine and provides valuable performance metrics. It has multiple filters\u2014ER metrics, inpatient treatment instances, out-of-network treatments, and primary care provider-to-specialist ratios, to name just a few. Drilling into prescription patterns, for example, providers may discover new opportunities to offer generic medicine at lower cost to patients. Tableau provides Cigna with greater flexibility to support our Collaborative Care providers who benefit from on-demand, actionable data and access to analysts who study their medical cost patterns and trends, allowing them to improve care and generate cost savings for their patients. Additionally, the Tableau reporting suite can identify potentially avoidable complications related to certain procedures and the occurrence rate, thus focusing efforts on the best opportunities to improve outcomes and avoid additional future complication costs. This level of detail, not typically found in electronic health records, provides value to clinicians, surgical groups and medical facilities, by uncovering significant cost savings for the practice that can translate into increased affordability for their patients. Other benefits made possible by Cigna's Tableau reporting include:\n\u25cf Improved HIPAA compliance, facilitated by Tableau\u2019s integration with Cigna's user-authenticated portal for reporting access\n\u25cf An understanding of physician or hospital utilization patterns that lead to shared savings\n\u25cf Ability to assess savings on the episode level (e.g. knee replacement, hip revision, etc. for orthopedic episodes)\n\u25cf Better resource prioritization and optimization, enabled by actionable insights Opioid misuse and addiction is a national public health crisis that adversely affects social and economic welfare. More than 100 people die from overdoses, daily, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that the economic impact of prescription opioid misuse in the US is $78.5 billion per year derived from healthcare costs, lost productivity, and treatment. Unfortunately, a serious issue arises when primary care physicians, who are unaware of patients\u2019 treatment by other providers, write opioid prescriptions for patients who have not been identified as at risk for opioid misuse or abuse. In collaboration with Collaborative Care partners, Cigna hypothesized that existing data could be used to better control opioid delivery. This led to the creation of the Opioid Drug Utilization report in Tableau that filters by number of patients treated per provider, the number of prescriptions written, their duration, and by date filled. The report incorporated both patients that the provider is contractually obligated to manage, as well as other patients (e.g. patients without primary care providers), since misuse and addiction reaches beyond those patients within their contractual obligations. As a result, providers now have a view into which patients are at risk or fall outside of CDC guidelines. With this comprehensive view, Cigna provider partners decreased opioid prescriptions by 25 percent\u2014a goal that was met earlier than planned\u2014and Cigna now has a goal to reduce overdoses by 25 percent in key markets during the next two years. Tableau will track progress in quarterly reviews as they take action, and these efforts dovetail with the U.S. Surgeon General\u2019s \u201cTurn the Tide\u201d pledge and the CDC\u2019s opioid prescribing guidelines. To ensure comprehensive stakeholder support, Cigna implemented two Tableau Server instances: one geared for internal analysts and management who offer consultative services to ACOs and another that is directly accessed by ACOs in the reporting portal. The analytics team monitors dashboard performance across the servers to identify training opportunities, look for areas where design changes may help adoption, and monitor how specific reports influence use. This detailed evaluation wasn\u2019t possible before Tableau. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if people used or ignored them, and how fruitful they were. Now we can track individual dashboard utilization to users and connect population health performance to how strongly providers made use of our reporting solutions,\u201d stated Paul. As previously noted, Cigna learned that 41 percent of respondents use the quarterly performance dashboards more often thanks to Tableau\u2019s visual format. \u201cIn fact, one of our ACO clients in North Carolina told us that the \u2018more detailed, practical reporting shows us specific ways to reduce costs.,\u2019\u201d Paul explained."

        "company": "Tiket.com",
        "content": "Tiket.com is a leading online travel agency player in Indonesia providing online booking services for flights, hotels, trains, car rentals, as well as events and attractions. In the fast-growing travel industry where more companies are using data to rise above the competition, Tiket.com wanted to find the right tool that could help them maximise efficiency and business value from data. VP of Data Maria Tjahjadi shares how Tiket.com built a trusted data hub in Tableau, empowering business users to make sense of big data for more strategic decisions. When the VP of Data joined Tiket.com in late 2018, she found a company that knew there was value in data but was being hampered by two significant issues. The first was that the existing tools could not cope with the amount of data Tiket.com needed to process. With up to 150 terabytes worth of data per table, and more than 20 million rows of transaction data, large reports took more than an hour to load and would often cause computers to crash. The second issue was that business users could not access their data easily because the tools were too complex for non-technical users. Tiket.com saw Tableau as a powerful and reliable data analytics platform with a great user experience. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and no programming skills required, Tableau\u2019s ease of use has allowed the company to quickly put the power of data into the hands of more staff. Within six months, Tiket.com was able to grow the number of Tableau users from single digits to over 300. Today, hundreds of reports are produced across the business to allow staff to make informed, timely decisions. \u201cThe difference since adopting Tableau has been remarkable. We no longer have any performance issues as reports load now within 10 seconds,\u201d says Maria. \u201cTableau\u2019s ease of use has quickly made it part of our decision-making process, and now 80% of users access it every day to get insights from their data.\u201d The introduction of Tableau has drastically reduced the amount of time spent on reporting, setting off a wave of productivity gains throughout the business. Previously, every department would spend up to three days every week preparing reports for a weekly management meeting. This time-consuming process involved extracting the data from the database, creating charts in Excel, then pasting the charts into PowerPoint. Today, reports update automatically on Tableau\u2019s dynamic dashboards, so retrieving the latest data takes only a few seconds. Tableau\u2019s advanced filtering functions allow users to answer the management\u2019s questions on the spot, without the need to go back and compile another report after the meeting. Tableau has also enabled Tiket.com to create a single source of truth across all business units. Before Tableau, every department used its own data to produce reports based on its own parameters. Tableau is now a data hub accessed by everyone, ensuring consistency in business metrics and KPIs. \u201cWith this common understanding, our management meetings have become so much more efficient. With Tableau we can drill down and answer questions on the spot and quickly achieve deep, actionable insights,\u201d Maria added. \u201cThese meetings used to take up to four hours, but now we can achieve more than we used to in a quarter of the time.\u201d One of Tiket.com\u2019s strengths is the amount of data it is able to capture on customer behaviour, but the company was not able to utilise this data in a meaningful way. \u201cSince we started using Tableau, we have been able to combine many different types of data from the pre-purchase to the post-purchase stage,\u201d shares Maria. \u201cThis gives our marketing team true visibility into the customer journey so we can engage our target customers at the right touchpoints.\u201d As an online travel agency, building smart partnerships that add value to the business is the key to success. Now Tiket.com\u2019s sales team uses Tableau to track hotel reviews and evaluate which opportunities to pursue in different destinations, and the best way to close the deal. Tableau has also helped Tiket.com empower their existing partners with data analytics capabilities. By migrating all partners\u2019 reports from a legacy system to a separate Tableau Server, partners can also track their own sales performance on Tiket.com and make data-driven decisions. This year, Tiket.com aims to become the fifth unicorn in Indonesia this year, using data as a key differentiator. The next stage for Tiket.com is empowering even more staff with data with Tableau\u2019s new Ask Data feature. \u201cI think natural language processing can open up a whole new world of possibilities for non-technical users to make the most out of their data,\u201d adds Maria. \u201cMy vision for Tiket.com is to become 100% data-driven, where no data means no decision,\u201d says Maria, who shares a recent story of how one of her Board of Directors reacted when he thought Tableau was down. \u201cHe started the hashtag #tableauislife because, in his words, \u2018Without Tableau, I have no life, because Tableau is my life now!\u2019 This showed me how much our management values data, so I know our data-driven strategy is the right one.\u201d VISIDATA delivers business intelligence solutions to help companies deal with data deluge and get immediate returns from reliable and relevant data management systems."

        "title": "Australian Financial Security Authority futureproofs workforce with Tableau",
        "company": "Australian Financial Security Authority",
        "content": "The Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA) is an executive agency in the Attorney-General\u2019s portfolio, with broad-ranging services aimed at securing Australia\u2019s economic health and security, ranging from regulating the personal insolvency sector through to managing economically significant registers/key pieces of Australia\u2019s credit infrastructure which support secured lending in Australia. The adoption of enterprise-wide self-service analytics at AFSA was significantly impacted by the work AFSA\u2019s Human Resources (HR) team have done in the workforce analysis and analytics space. Assistant Director - Workforce Analytics and Planning Adina Leu, and Director \u2013 Applications Services Richard Datson shared how Tableau became a one-stop-shop for all people managers to access reliable insights on their workforce, helping them make operational and strategic decisions whilst continuing to build high-performing, happy and productive teams.\nMajor time savings achieved with Tableau also helped the Workforce Analytics and Planning team move into advanced workforce planning with predictive and prescriptive workforce data modelling, and monitoring internal and external trends to maximise opportunity and minimize risk. Tableau has changed the way the Workforce Analytics team delivers services to stakeholders, allowing them to access timely workforce data that is automatically refreshed daily, shares Richard. About four years ago, before Tableau, managers had access to very limited workforce data provided to them by the HR team only a few times a year. Without timely information, AFSA\u2019s managers struggled to make effective decisions about their workforce. With automated reports now updating daily, and monthly reports optimised with dashboards updating previous month\u2019s data on the very first day of every month, AFSA\u2019s Workforce Analytics team has gained capacity to respond to more reporting needs, provide more services (such as analysis and analytics) and reach broader audiences in the organisation with the same amount of resources. In fact, Adina shares that Tableau has \u201calmost entirely reduced ad-hoc workforce reporting, saving resources equivalent to 1 full-time employee\u201d, which was invested in higher-value activities for the business. The only ad-hoc workforce data and reporting requests the team are currently receiving are in relation to non-standard external requests (such as Parliamentary questions on notice or ministerial briefings) - and even then, the team is able to quickly retrieve the answers via Tableau at their fingertips, she adds. When it comes to communicating with internal governance bodies (e.g.: AFSA\u2019s Risk and Operational Management Committee or the Board), timely workforce data and insights are equally critical for organisational risk management and decision making. Before using Tableau, AFSA\u2019s HR Reporting Team would take up to two weeks to create a static report based on snapshot workforce data; by the time the particular committee convened, the data would have become month-old and out of date. \u201cRight now, with Tableau, they discuss based on workforce data that\u2019s accurate, reliable and updated overnight,\u201d says Adina. The Workforce Analytics team works with 6 years of workforce data for their workforce, updated daily from the source HR system into AFSA\u2019s enterprise data warehouse. \u201cConnecting Tableau directly to 6 years' worth of our workforce data gives us a solid base for reliable forecasting, which is especially important for workforce size management,\u201d says Adina. As a Federal Government agency, AFSA is subject to a staffing cap and needs to be able to optimise resources and minimise service delivery risks arising from workforce availability shortages. Therefore by providing managers, leaders, HR Business Partners and the wider HR team with visibility into not only the current state of the workforce, but also future trends and forecasts, Tableau workforce dashboards offer a key input into workforce planning conversations. With the additional capacity gained from providing managers with access to self-service workforce data, the Workforce Analytics team can now deliver deeper insights such as labour market trends and environmental scanning to help senior leaders define what their future workforce should look like in terms of capabilities needed, current gaps and opportunities and plans to mitigate immediate and longer term risks. \u201cTableau has significantly increased AFSA\u2019s maturity in the workforce reporting and analytics space, and this is a key component to advanced and effective workforce planning to meet the agency\u2019s future workforce capacity and capability demands,\u201d shares Adina. \u201cApart from workforce data, the data warehouse has data from AFSA\u2019s various case management systems. This data combined with HR data allows AFSA to report on workforce performance based on various demographics such as location and team function. This reporting is also available via Tableau\u201d, shares Richard. This has made Tableau the go-to tool for staff across AFSA\u2019s business lines to access the data they need for operational and strategic planning.\n\u201cThrough using Tableau, we discovered that our users were keen to have visibility into and take ownership of their data to make evidence-based decisions,\u201d Adina observes.\nBuilding a strong partnership with Richard\u2019s Data Warehouse and Reporting team has been key to the delivery of our workforce analysis and analytics program of work, adds Adina. Moving forward, as staff and managers become more accustomed to utilising Tableau as a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d for workforce data, Adina hopes that more Tableau champions can venture into more advanced analytics for their own teams, such as the predictive modelling that her Workforce Analytics team or Richard\u2019s Data Warehouse team are currently doing for business units. \u201cWith the growing importance of data and analytics in the modern business landscape, HR teams need to deliver greater value by providing actionable insights through powerful visualisations and storytelling that can reach broad audiences.\u201d \u201cTableau has certainly delivered a mechanism to do so,\u201d Adina says."

        "content": "Emtek Group is Indonesia\u2019s most prominent media group, with more than 30 subsidiaries providing solutions and services ranging across the media, content and digital space. Emtek provides consumers with a comprehensive suite of services and experiences such as TV, digital media and content, e-commerce and payments. This all-encompassing media ecosystem creates opportunities for advertisers to influence their target groups at different touchpoints along the consumer journey. To help Emtek realise the true potential of this ecosystem, GM Business Development Edward Mulianto introduced Tableau to create a single source of truth shared across the Group of 10,000 employees. He shares that Tableau has changed the game, creating a data-driven culture of sharing insights at both Group and subsidiary levels. Across the Group, data was managed in many different ways by different people. With no standardised system, resources or end-to-end system integration, business users worked with unclean, scattered and unreliable data. \u201cSenior management at the Group and subsidiary level faced a blizzard of monthly, quarterly and annual reports,\u201d recalls Edward. \u201cThe effect was that reports were simply being ignored. Instead, whenever anyone needed insights, they relied on data analysts to prepare reports, which took two to three days.\u201d With the help of their IT partner VISIDATA, Emtek Group introduced Tableau across its subsidiaries, creating a single source of truth with their data. With the ability to combine and integrate different data sources within Tableau, Emtek's top management can drill down to view data from various subsidiaries at different levels of granularity. In addition, Tableau has also helped boost Emtek's performance across the Group. One of the biggest challenges in a conglomerate group is tracking performance and ensuring transparency. Tableau has enabled true visibility and become a trusted source of performance data for the top management. Subsidiaries also get motivated to hit their KPIs and improve performance, helping the Group's business to grow. Today\u2019s media landscape is going through a fundamental shift, with changing consumer behaviour blurring the lines between digital and traditional media. For instance, Emtek\u2019s SCTV is one of Indonesia\u2019s top free-to-air television channels, with audiences reaching more than 70% of households across Indonesia. Today, however, many viewers are choosing to watch the channel online \u2013 despite having a TV. For Emtek, this crossover was a potential data gold mine, but synergy between companies was essential to realise this value. Since adopting Tableau, Emtek\u2019s subsidiaries have been able to share valuable data, meaning those that could not collect consumer data themselves \u2013 such as traditional TV channels \u2013 have been able to benefit from their digital counterparts. By analysing data from its online video platform, Vidio.com, Emtek gained a deeper understanding of Indonesian viewers, helping them curate more relevant programmes and strengthen their position as a market leader. Beyond monitoring and reporting, the Business Development GM aims to leverage more advanced analytics capabilities such as predictive analytics to create better content for viewers. \"By analysing data from users' content consumption, we can understand and predict which types of content appeal to specific audience segments. These insights are very useful in planning for our content acquisitions and original productions, which is instrumental to our growth.\" Today, top stakeholders in almost every subsidiary have access to Tableau, but Emtek\u2019s end goal is to deploy Tableau thoroughly across the whole Group. \u201cTableau has fostered a data-conscious and data-driven culture across Emtek Group,\u201d says Edward. \u201cAfter seeing what Tableau can do, business leaders are now excited about how it could potentially transform their companies.\u201d VISIDATA is a company built by professionals with an extensive track record in delivering business intelligence solutions for corporations. They focus on helping companies deal with data deluge using the right tools with the right approach, with a mission to help clients rapidly implement and get immediate returns from reliable and relevant BI and Data Management systems."

        "content": "real.digital operates \u201creal.de\u201d, one of the biggest marketplaces in Germany with more than 5,000 merchants offering over 15 million products. When the statistical company reporting based on SQL requests and spreadsheets reached a limit because of the vast amounts of data, in November, 2018 the management of real.digital initiated a company-wide roll out of Tableau as a universal reporting tool. The purpose was to increase the profitability of the company, to address additional growth and to streamline internal processes. In the past, central business reporting was accomplished mainly via a stationary, daily updated website showing a list of metrics based on SQL queries. Such internal departmental analyses based on Excel were reaching a limit due to the growing amount of data. \u201cSuch a meager offer of analytics will in the long run be insufficient if the goal is to be successful on the scale of Amazon,\u201d explains Richard Hondrich. Therefore, the company in fall 2018 made the decision to roll out a company-wide analysis tool with ease of use and the option to be used largely independently in the company divisions. An assessment phase was initiated, with groups of 10 users evaluating four different reporting tools available on the market, for a maximum of two weeks. Selection criteria were data connection, usability, user ranking and value for money. \u201cThe winner of this evaluation was Tableau,\u201d reports Richard Hondrich. \u201cSo we simply purchased one Tableau Server and 100 Tableau Creator licenses and equipped all associates in key positions in the company with them. To help colleagues clear the first hurdles of use, we additionally acquired a contingent of introductory trainings from a realization service provider as an \u2018enablement approach\u2019 and implemented them.\u201d Subsequently the divisions very quickly started producing a variety of visualizations using Tableau. \u201cOur employees adopted the new tool generally in a very positive way,\u201d reports Richard Hondrich. \u201cAfter a short period of time we already had requests from users for additional training offers or about specialized topics like restrictions of the analyzed data set or live connections.\u201d A usage case of particular interest occurred in the area of customer service. In the past a spreadsheet with 440 million rows and a total size of about 800 GB had to be analyzed by complex SQL requests to gather the daily performance report on customer satisfaction, number of open requests, frequency of complaints, duration of calls, processing times, etc. The results were then transferred into a Google Sheet or Excel and for the report into PowerPoint. The daily investment of time amounted to 60 - 90 minutes and the report was prone to error because some processes were done manually. \u201cSince completion of the corresponding Tableau dashboard this daily effort of 60 - 90 minutes is moot and the data is always current for the day,\u201d explains Richard Hondrich. \u201cWe are intensifying the training of particular Tableau users and deploy them targeted in all divisions,\u201d reports Richard Hondrich. \u201cThese users will act as \u2018Tableau lighthouses\u2019 on-site and professionalize the work of their colleagues. Besides this, we\u2019re working on company-wide standards and best practices in the area of data engineering and are available for extended support requests. Additionally there is an ongoing homogenizing and cleaning of our databases which mainly come together in our Google BigQuery data warehouse, on top of which Tableau exists as a layer of visualizing and analysis.\u201d As Tableau is used in the divisions more and more, there is a change of opinion in the company, according to Richard Hondrich:\n\u201cUsers who until now may have been rather passive consumers of reports ponder the source data and their suitability for particular analyses more and more. Interest regarding their creation and significance is rising greatly. In the beginning, some users try to use Tableau like a spreadsheet program, just out of habit; more information and education will indubitably be useful here.\u201d Overall, Richard Hondrich perceives the company as heading in the right direction with Tableau: \u201cThere sure is still a lot of work to do to fully exploit Tableau\u2019s enormous potential for use at all workplaces in the company. However, the first successes prove us right and reinforce our belief that it was the correct decision to equip our employees with all the opportunities for self service reporting.\u201d"

        "company": "Bank Negara Indonesia",
        "content": "Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) is a state-owned enterprise bank that conducts commercial and consumer banking services, with global offices in Singapore, Tokyo, London, New York City and more. Tableau plays an important role in their analytics, profiling and information delivery. The head office uses Tableau to disseminate information and reports to 16 regional offices, 200 branches and 1,000 sub-branches across Indonesia. Assistant Vice President of BNI\u2019s Information Delivery Group, Firman Taufik, shares how BNI uses Tableau to monitor financial performance on a regional and branch level, as well as customer activities such as opening and closing of accounts, or their usage of Internet and mobile banking services. By monitoring these activities and profiling customers with Tableau, BNI can plan more targeted promotions to improve acquisition and retention. For the past five years, BNI has been on a journey moving from traditional to modern analytics with Tableau as their visual reporting and analytics tool, growing the number of Tableau users by more than tenfold. Tech consulting company Cybertrend partnered BNI and provided close support in their initial stages of planning and Tableau implementation. With 40,000 employees serving millions of customers worldwide, BNI was working with big data of 30 terabytes and growing, without a central depository that management at all levels could refer to. Before Tableau, managers had to rely on reports issued from the head office, which were only summaries of data that lacked detail. For example, data on account openings did not include the names and demographic information of customers, so it was very difficult to track progress and targets, or make strategic decisions based on insights. Tableau helped BNI's head office consolidate a single source of truth and get a bird\u2019s eye view across all offices and branches, with the ability to drill down and analyse data at different levels of the business. Up to 250 workbooks and 750 views have been created in Tableau, used daily by managers across the country to monitor branch performance and motivate their employees to hit targets. With more transparency and access to accurate and in-depth insights, it is easier to execute management decisions and strategy effectively on the ground. Tableau has also improved the company\u2019s productivity by increasing speed to insight from one week to one day. As compared to previously when reports were done using Excel and SQL which required programming expertise and took up to one week, Tableau has enabled non-technical users to do analysis intuitively with the drag-and-drop functions. Directors and branch managers also like the convenience of accessing Tableau dashboards on the go via mobile, allowing them to ask and answer questions during meetings. Moving forward, BNI plans to build self-service analytics capabilities across the enterprise by training more \u201cTableau Champions\u201d across different divisions, eventually expanding Tableau\u2019s data exploration capabilities to all regional branches and front-line managers to elevate the quality and efficiency of BNI\u2019s work as a banking enterprise. \u201cIn the future, we hope to create a self-service data-driven culture so that our users get addicted to the power of having data in their hands,\u201d shares Firman. Cybertrend helps to bring data science into the heart of day-to-day industries\u2019 business. They combine domain knowledge with specialist technical skills to deliver high-impact analysis using data insights, predictive models and data-centric business advice."

        "title": "Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership boosts quality of care for over 2.8 million people with Tableau",
        "company": "Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership",
        "content": "Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership (GMHSCP) is responsible for the physical and mental wellbeing of over 2.8 million citizens living in 10 localities that make up Greater Manchester, UK. In April 2016, it became the first formally devolved healthcare service in the UK, putting it in charge of its own health/social care services and spending plans. Shortly after devolution took place, GMHSCP invested in a major overhaul of its data infrastructure, replacing the existing network of disparate spreadsheets with a Microsoft SQL data warehouse and Tableau, as part of a new digital strategy. Doing so has enabled true collaboration across the whole partnership for the first time, reducing data silos and creating greater transparency. This has had a particularly significant impact on A&E activity, where all 11 hospitals within the partnership can now work together through Tableau, using near real-time data to make informed tactical decisions and deliver the highest quality patient care possible. Prior to devolution in 2016, most NHS organizations and local authorities in the Greater Manchester area either had no or not fit for purpose business information (BI) tools in place for analysis, collaboration or dissemination. Instead, many relied on a system of local spreadsheets, databases or bespoke web based systems, resulting in numerous disparate approaches making collaborative analytics and data sharing extremely difficult. When Graham Beales joined the newly formed GMHSCP as Head of Business Intelligence, it quickly became clear that a new solution was needed on both the data and visualization sides. \u201cI came into a nest of spreadsheets and no BI function of which to speak,\u201d says Graham. \u201cThere was no real architecture in place and the only reports being created were constitutional reports that are part of the partnership\u2019s statutory duties. There was scope to do so much more.\u201d As a prior Tableau user, Graham quickly started demonstrating the benefits it could bring to the GMHSCP. After positive initial feedback he teamed up with IT service management partner, InterWorks, to present a case for its adoption as part of a wider infrastructure overhaul. \u201cI built a strategy that focused on investing in a new data warehouse to centralize all data from the wider system that wasn\u2019t currently accessible,\u201d says Graham. \u201cFrom there, we needed to visualize and disseminate that information as efficiently as possible and I knew Tableau would be the perfect tool for this.\u201d Graham\u2019s proposal aligned closely with the partnership\u2019s new digital strategy, which placed strong emphasis on the adoption of highly accessible, cloud-based, infrastructure independent solutions. The implementation also coincided with development of a new overarching BI function across the partnership, which ensured strong buy-in from all members and helped encourage a much smoother, more collaborative approach to data management going forward. \u201cIt was very important that it wasn\u2019t seen as something we were doing in an ivory tower,\u201d says Graham. \u201cThe approach we took meant we were able to bring everyone on the same journey, helping the whole of the GMHSCP analytical community to develop and enhance their skills.\u201d GMHSCP\u2019s new infrastructure sees data stored in a Microsoft SQL data warehouse, with Tableau used for all analytics and visualization needs. Both are housed within GMSS shared services architecture, making them accessible to nearly all of the organizations within the wider partnership, allowing for faster data collaboration, sharing and reporting. In the past 12 months, the number of developers trained to use Tableau has risen from 20 to well over 100, reflecting the growing investment that organizations throughout GMHSCP are making in its use. Graham notes that much of this success to date was made possible with the support received from InterWorks. \u201cThey worked with us to develop business plans and get the right level of resourcing, which had to be flexible as our needs have changed throughout the process,\u201d says Graham. \u201cWe also developed bespoke Tableau training using real NHS data, which has really helped to accelerate employee understanding and skill development.\u201d In addition to GMHSCP, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), led by Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, has also trained many of its research team members on Tableau, who are now using the platform as their main method of data visualization, collaboration and development as well. \u201cOne of the mayor\u2019s key pledges last year was for greater transparency with the public around children and young people\u2019s mental health in the Greater Manchester area,\u201d says Graham. \u201cThe report released by the GMCA at the end of December 2018 was completely built in Tableau and was the direct result of close collaboration with mental health providers throughout the partnership.\u201d The report is the first of its kind in the UK, shedding light on key areas such as the waiting times experienced at different stages of the treatment process. It also offers clear transparency and clinical rationale as to why the GMHSCP isn\u2019t quite where it wants to be yet and how it intends to get there in the future. The GMCA has made a commitment to release the report to the public on a quarterly basis, so they can track whether improvements are being made or not. \u201cWhile the report will only be available to the public as a static PDF for the time being, internally it\u2019s a fully interactive Tableau dashboard that can be used by all of our providers and commissioners, as well as ourselves,\u201d says Graham. \u201cFor the first time we\u2019ve got a single source of truth that can be shared across multiple organizations, which is a huge step for us.\u201d One of GMHSCP\u2019s flagship Tableau initiatives is the development of its Urgent Care Reporting Tool, which collates status information from all 11 of its A&E departments into a single dashboard in near-real time, allowing for fast, tactical decision making. \u201cUsing Tableau, we can see everything that\u2019s happening in our hospitals, from how many people are there, to how long they\u2019ve been waiting and if they require a bed,\u201d says Graham. \u201cThat information allows everyone to make informed decisions throughout the day and work collaboratively as a group to deliver the levels of care required, rather than as 11 separate entities.\u201d The Urgent Care Reporting Tool is also available via Tableau Mobile, meaning on-call response officers can quickly log in and assess the current system status from wherever they are, at any given time during their shift. GMHSCP is now also working alongside the Greater Manchester Emergency Response Hub to see how the dashboard can be used to deliver even higher quality of care, based on the specific needs of individual patients. \u201cUsing Tableau alongside existing infrastructure, hub commanders can reach into the stack of waiting ambulances and make a clinical assessment about a particular patient\u201d says Graham. \u201cArmed with this information, they might be able to divert an ambulance to a neighboring A&E where the patient will be in and out two hours faster than if they are simply taken to the nearest one. Not only is this better for the patient, it makes for a much more effective system as a whole.\u201d"

        "content": "GetSmarter, a brand of 2U, Inc., partners with the world's leading universities to select, design and deliver premium online short courses with a data-driven focus on learning gain. 2U is a global leader in education technology and trusted partner of great universities that has created more than 250 digital and in-person educational offerings. Tableau has helped GetSmarter answer increasingly advanced data questions and make more informed business decisions at every level of their business. Tableau\u2019s automated reporting and security functionality also gives GetSmarter and its university partners on-demand access to data from anywhere in the world. As a digital education company catering to students all over the world, GetSmarter collects, analyses and shares a wide variety of data every day. Prior to Tableau, GetSmarter was using another tool for all of its reporting and analytics tasks. However, while sufficient for basic activities, the company increasingly found the tool couldn\u2019t answer the more advanced business questions being asked of it. \u201cOur previous reporting tool served us well, but the need arose to move to a more feature rich analytics platform for an ever growing company,\u201d says Gerhard Lennox, Head of Data Systems at GetSmarter. \u201cThe functionality and features that we were looking for in a reporting tool included multi layered project functionality, hosting on our own infrastructure in order to control performance, as well as fine grain permission sets for advanced security and decreased data latency\u201d. Proof of concept was carried out across a variety of leading tools, but Tableau was selected as the ideal solution for several reasons. \u201cWe chose Tableau because of its ability to help us see and understand data so well,\u201d says Gerhard. \u201cNot only does it provide the deep dive analytics capability we were looking for, it also allows us to create visually appealing, highly interactive dashboards that quickly answer even the most complex business questions.\u201d Gerhard also attributes the move to Tableau to GetSmarter\u2019s acquisition by 2U in 2017. \u201c2U was already using Tableau, so standardizing across the company post-acquisition made a lot of sense.\u201d With Tableau in place, departments including finance, marketing, sales, HR, education, and program management can all now self-serve their own analytics needs, create visualizations and answer key data questions. \u201cTableau has enabled us to significantly improve accuracy in key areas such as forecasting and planning, course performance analysis and marketing campaign evaluation,\u201d says Gerhard. \u201cAs a result, we can make informed decisions and significantly improve our overall business performance.\u201d Tableau was implemented as part of a wider infrastructure overhaul at GetSmarter post-acquisition, which also saw the construction of a new reporting data warehouse. Tableau integrates directly with this data warehouse, creating a single source of truth across all departments. \u201cBy consolidating our company data into a data warehouse and layering Tableau over the top, everyone has access to the same up-to-date information at all times.\u201d As a result, overall trust in data has improved throughout the company, which Gerhard says is a real testament to Tableau\u2019s capabilities. The GetSmarter product team works with university partners across the world, all of whom share and receive data with and from GetSmarter. \u201cTableau\u2019s wide range of flexible permissions allows us to tailor access to data within the platform,\u201d says Gerhard. \u201cThis is extremely important as it helps us to secure and monitor access to that data.\u201d In addition, the ability to create individual sites for different users within Tableau Server allowed Gerhard and his team to provide each university partner with its own site, with custom dashboards to view Tableau reports and analysis in real time. \u201cCustom dashboards were another big selling point for us,\u201d says Gerhard. \u201cWe currently work with a number of university partners, and personal touches like this add a greater sense of professionalism to the work we do and the way we share data.\u201d Prior to Tableau, the GetSmarter product team was tasked with managing over 400 reports on a regular basis, which was time consuming and resource heavy. Now, the same information has been consolidated into just 70 Tableau dashboards, many of which are fully automated from a data perspective and require very little maintenance from the data infrastructure team. \u201cTableau\u2019s scheduled extract functionality as well as the direct connection to source has allowed everyone to have access to the latest data at their fingertips at all times.\u201d says Gerhard."

        "company": "PEMCO Insurance",
        "content": "PEMCO Insurance is a personal-lines mutual insurance company based in Seattle, that serves Washington and Oregon residents. Founded in 1949, it employs over 500 staff and boasts revenues of $458.4 million (2017). One of the many ways PEMCO uses Tableau is to accurately track and monitor all of its ongoing insurance claims, significantly improving closure rates and ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction. A combination of Tableau tools, applications, and dashboards also enables fast, efficient server management, while flexible permissions keep sensitive data secure at all times. Like any insurance company, PEMCO\u2019s claims team is constantly juggling high volumes of ongoing insurance claims, all of which are at different stages of the resolution process. Prior to Tableau, each adjuster had to track all of their individual claims manually, a system that was prone to human error and could result in claims stalling unnecessarily or slipping through the cracks altogether. \u201cWhen an adjuster can\u2019t see what claims they still have open or what\u2019s assigned, they can fall off the map,\u201d says Tim Hughes, Tableau developer and admin at PEMCO Insurance. \u201cThis gives off the impression that customer service is not a priority, when for us as a company, it absolutely is.\u201d Now, all ongoing claims information is tracked through one Tableau dashboard that connects directly to the company\u2019s data warehouse. The status of every claim can be monitored and reviewed from a single location, with adjusters self-serving their data needs and senior management able to see a comprehensive overview at all times. The result is a significant improvement in claim closure rates, leading to higher customer satisfaction and a boost to overall business performance. \u201cUsing a single Tableau dashboard, adjusters can track every claim they have open, follow up with customers and close claims in a timelier manner. As a result, they\u2019re able to provide a much better service where they couldn\u2019t before.\u201d PEMCO currently runs a 16-core Tableau deployment, giving all 500 employees round-the-clock access to a full range of data and analytics capabilities. Since implementation in December 2016, over 50% of employees have become monthly Tableau users, demonstrating how quickly its popularity has grown throughout the company. In the Claims department specifically, Tableau usage is even higher; with 76% of employees viewing dashboards monthly, 59% viewing them weekly and 19% viewing daily. In order to keep everything running smoothly, the company utilizes a series of additional Tableau tools and applications in conjunction with Tableau Server. \u201cWe have a whole server ecosystem,\u201d says Tim. \u201cWe have our disaster recovery server for standard failover events, plus our test server that we use primarily for testing upgrades before moving them to the production server.\u201d \u201cWe also have a utilities server that\u2019s used for monitoring the production server and testing the test server. A variety of Tableau open source applications are installed there to help us with this, including TabMon, for production server monitoring, TabJolt, to stress test the test server when preparing for upgrades, and LogShark, to ingest log files from the production server.\u201d The whole ecosystem is run and monitored using a series of 45 Tableau dashboards, giving a complete overview of all hardware and applications, as well as allowing permission auditing and content organization. This allows Tim and his team to quickly pinpoint the causes of any issues as they arise, boosting productivity and avoiding unnecessary downtime. \u201cThere have been multiple times where an individual user has pinged me to say the performance is pretty slow and I can quickly look at the dashboards and say, \u2018it's just slow for you,\u2019\u201d says Tim. \u201cThen, I can dig deeper and tell them it\u2019s because the workbook they\u2019re connecting to has a live custom SQL query against an underpowered database.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ways we\u2019re able to respond quickly because of the tools we've built with Tableau,\u201d continues Tim. \u201cThese range from individual HTTP requests like the one I just mentioned, right through to when our data warehouse ETL process runs too long, impacting extract creation. When that happens, Tableau alerts us to the issue right away, so we can quickly get to the bottom of it.\u201d Data security is a major priority in the insurance industry, where many claims include sensitive medical information. The first layer of PEMCO\u2019s permissions management strategy is to exclude all personally identifiable information (PII) from the data warehouse. This means all analysts can be given access, without any concerns about individuals viewing sensitive data that they shouldn\u2019t be. The company then uses Tableau\u2019s flexible permissions to ensure claim-related data is accessible at all times to only the relevant people. \u201cWe use permissions mostly to lock access to specific projects, rather than to each workbook, although there are, of course, exceptions to that rule,\u201d says Tim. \u201cFor instance, in our test project, permissions are set on a workbook-by-workbook basis, so when analysts are publishing content they can create their own user acceptance testing group and give those people access.\u201d \u201cWe also have a cross-functional project so when a workbook doesn't fall neatly into a specific category it can be published there and have individual permissions set,\u201d adds Tim, \u201cTableau\u2019s flexible permissions allow us to do all these things quickly and easily, maintaining data integrity at all times.\u201d Tableau\u2019s automation features have also helped to significantly reduce the burden on PEMCO\u2019s analyst team, allowing them to focus on more business-critical activities. \u201cThe ability to filter, save a customized view and subscribe goes such a long way,\u201d says Tim. \u201cWe use that ad nauseum across our deployment to get people the relevant information that they need, without relying on our analysts to provide it every time.\u201d The company has also streamlined many of its content management processes, such as archiving stale workbooks, using the Tableau Server REST API. Doing so has cut time consuming manual tasks while simultaneously improving data relevance and quality. \u201cIf something on our production server hasn\u2019t been used for 120 days, then Tableau will automatically move it to the archive,\u201d says Tim. \u201cThen, if it sits untouched in the archive for 395 days, it will be deleted, but not before the owner has been notified 30 days in advance, giving them time to act if necessary.\u201d \u201cThis kind of functionality is simple, but has quickly become incredibly valuable to us,\u201d concludes Tim. \u201cIf Tableau went away tomorrow, what would we do? I don\u2019t know even want to think about it!\u201d"

        "content": "Navig8 Group is a global provider of integrated shipping services spanning across commercial pool management, fuels and offshore operations. With main offices in Singapore and London, Navig8 manages a portfolio of vessels for a wide network of oil companies, commodities traders and ship owners. With transparent financial and operational reporting of near real-time data, Navig8 assures fleet owners of cost efficiency and high-quality maintenance. Enterprise Architect Nick Gole shares how they created a single source of truth in Tableau with an integrated data warehouse, providing a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d of shipping services from ship management, chartering, operations to fuelling. As an integrated services platform working across international shipping routes, Navig8 worked with multiple data sources across different divisions and back-end systems. Before Tableau, each data source would be exported to Excel, and different people would put the data together for their own reporting needs. Everyone was using different Excel sheets and creating inconsistent ad hoc reports. \u201cIt was extremely dangerous to move data around like that,\u201d recalls Nick. \u201cWe could have had potential consequences such as misreporting and compliance issues.\u201d With Tableau, all of Navig8\u2019s nine back-end systems such as their bunkering operating system, credit risk and enterprise resource planning package were integrated within a single data warehouse. Their partner Oak Consulting played an instrumental role in helping them build this data lake in Tableau, and today, all of Navig8\u2019s business units use this data warehouse, shares Nick. Within the past three years, the business has seen significant returns. Integrating over 200 entities from their finance package into the data warehouse has helped Navig8 eliminate the need for 400 Excel sheets and month-end finance reports, which used to take up to 20 man days of effort every month by a team of people solely working on these reports. \u201cWith Tableau, all our financial data is available in one click, and our CFOs can get any information they want anytime.\u201d A vital part of the Navig8 business is the fuels division, Integr8, which helps secure the best deals to fuel all the ships running in their commercial and offshore pools. Fuel makes up the heaviest cost for a ship, with some ships running on up to 100 tonnes a day. Monitoring the efficiency, productivity and profit margins of the fuels business is vital, and Tableau now enables Navig8 to visualise these stats in a single planning dashboard, as opposed to over 50 Excel sheets previously just for the Integr8 business. Today, 10 tabs in a Tableau workbook gives Navig8 a clear overview and visibility into the day-to-day bunkering operations of the fuels division. One of the biggest rewards of visualising data in Tableau is giving business users \u201cone snapshot of their whole workspace\u201d, shares Nick. While previously they had to rely on Excel and PDF reports distributed by email, now every team has their own dashboards tailored to their needs. For example, different members of the offshore team get data coming in from the offshore ships at different levels of visibility depending on their roles and what kind of data they require. This makes sure that when they come to their computers every morning, they can easily find the specific information they are looking for, drilled down from the same stack of data everyone else on their team gets access to. With business intelligence at a glance, the offshore team uses a \u201ctraffic light system\u201d in Tableau which automatically flags up problem areas in red, while smooth-running operations get lit up in green. This greatly simplifies the data for both the management and team by highlighting only the ships in each fleet they need to focus on for the day. \u201cThe biggest benefit of Tableau is self-help, because you are empowering users to do self-service analytics,\u201d says Nick. In the past with limited visibility into their data and no drill-down capabilities to answer questions, all business users had to rely on the analyst team to build reports, which could take up to two weeks, resulting in outdated data. \u201cTableau has completely changed Navig8\u2019s culture from being a data consumer to a company which sees actual commercial value in our data,\u201d shares Nick. \u201cOrdinary business users have become much more strategic in their thinking and work, because they can see and understand a lot more now with the ability to drill down on problem areas to fix them.\u201d With business users becoming more proactive, the analyst team has moved on to high-value work such as predictive modelling and building more strategic dashboards for the business, instead of constantly manipulating Excel sheets and answering questions. Tableau has given Navig8 competitive advantage in terms of greater transparency with customers by sharing deeper insights and real-time data, shares Nick. \u201cWe are now able to provide a lot of information and strategic insights to our customers which we could not do before, at a much better frequency, improving from monthly to daily communications.\u201d Navig8 maintains a leading edge with a new depth, breadth and speed of information they can now provide to their customers, such as how they are making better commercial decisions for their ships, and how they position their fleets to help clients yield more profit. \u201cI don\u2019t think many companies are in this space yet, where we are connecting our data sources and creating data models to do real-time reporting across our entire group,\u201d says Nick. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I think Oak Consulting has been a fundamental strategic partner to us.\u201d Oak Consulting is a Gold Tier Tableau value-added reseller and cloud solutions provider based in Singapore and Malaysia, providing data management and data analytics consulting services. They specialise in industries such as healthcare, education, retail and eCommerce, telecommunications, finance, shipping, airport hub, business and public services."

Headquartered in Hong Kong, AIA Group Limited has a presence across 18 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. Senior Manager of Enterprise Data, Dion Thorpe leads a team within the strategy department in running a centre of excellence to train and build a community of Tableau users. He shares how AIA Singapore used Tableau to optimize operations and understand the customer journey. Tableau has also helped the business accelerate decision-making with timely insights and achieve seamless integration across many markets. 1 in 4 employees at AIA Singapore are now using Tableau, and Dion\u2019s team is working towards enterprise-wide adoption. The software\u2019s interactive and intuitive user experience helped the team drive a data-first culture, empowering employees to understand the value of data and embrace analytics as a key part of decision-making. Getting from an insurance application form to an issued policy can be a long process involving assessments by multiple parties like underwriters and medical professionals. Delays can occur along the way, and teams would rely on more experienced employees to identify the roadblock based on conjecture. There was no evidence or deeper insights to help them understand where the problem lay and how to speed up the process. With Tableau dashboards, teams can track the application status and ensure timely conversion from pending to issued business. This improves AIA Singapore\u2019s services by giving customers greater peace of mind, and helps the business optimize its sales and operations processes. Every morning, AIA Singapore\u2019s leaders and executives track and monitor performance on Tableau dashboards. Previously, performance metrics could only be measured and shared through monthly reports, which would often be too late to respond to market changes. \u201cTableau has proven to be a great tool to do analysis on the fly to answer questions in meetings and presentations,\u201d says Dion. \u201cWe no longer have to wait up to five days to get answers to our questions.\u201d With updated information at their fingertips every day, teams in AIA can detect trends and adapt to changes, strengthening the company\u2019s competitive advantage. Analytics teams combine data from sales, claims and the AIA Vitality program to gain visibility into the end-to-end customer journey and understand their customers\u2019 profiles and needs better. AIA Vitality is a health and wellness program to encourage AIA customers to keep fit and lead a healthy lifestyle, with rewards and incentives along the way. Health data from the AIA Vitality program, combined with sales and claims data can be a powerful resource to help AIA build more personalized products and services to meet their customers\u2019 needs better, fulfilling the company\u2019s brand promise of enabling Healthier, Longer, Better Lives. The greatest reward for Dion and his team was to witness employees building their confidence and thinking more strategically for the business. Armed with deep insights from data, many business users in AIA have become trusted subject matter experts who shape the way the company thinks and operates strategically. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see people who are usually quiet go into meetings with their Tableau dashboards and advising the leaders on what should be done based on their findings from data,\u201d shares Dion. \u201cTableau has enabled a whole evolution.\u201d Having achieved success with Tableau in AIA Australia, the Senior Manager of Enterprise Data adapted the existing Tableau templates for AIA Singapore\u2019s market. He shares an example of how his team spent only 3 days to reverse-engineer a workbook from Australia, which took 2 years to build. \u201cThis is knowledge that someone would have taken two years to build up, but with Tableau we can transfer it immediately to get a new market up and running.\u201d While there are certainly market-centric needs across the Asia-Pacific region, the nature of the business is largely similar. AIA has witnessed growing collaboration between different markets because of Tableau. \u201cThere is always knowledge to be shared and benefits in sharing it. Tableau has been a scalable and effective analytics solution for our business so far, helping us gain valuable insights in Singapore and Australia, with more markets to come in future.\u201d"

        "company": "ICIS",
        "content": "ICIS is the world\u2019s largest petrochemical market information provider with divisions spanning energy and fertilizers. Its aim is to give companies in global commodities markets a competitive advantage by delivering valuable information and analytics tools, which enable them to identify and react to opportunities in constantly evolving markets. ICIS began using Tableau in 2016 to give its editorial team faster, more accurate access to key data insights, as well as give customers access to interactive embedded analytics. The company has also used Tableau to support its analytics tool, the Live Supply Disruption Tracker, which helps subscribers track over 3,000 planned and unplanned petrochemical plant shutdowns every year. ICIS has over 30 years of experience in delivering pricing intelligence, news, forecasting and analysis on global petrochemical, energy and fertilizer markets. The company produces multiple daily and weekly insight reports covering key aspects of these markets, which its subscribers use to make informed buying, selling and investment decisions. \u201cOur journalists spend the majority of their time speaking to the industry and collecting price information on various commodities,\u201d says Manca Vitorino, head of data operations at ICIS. \u201cAt the end of each day, they transform that information into price assessments using rigorous methodologies that help our customers understand how those prices might change tomorrow, next week or even next year.\u201d In order to do this accurately, ICIS\u2019s editorial team requires fast access to a wide range of current and historical industry data, as well as the tools needed to analyze it quickly and efficiently. Prior to Tableau, the team relied on Excel for much of this, which often led to problems with data fragmentation, quality and accuracy. \u201cExcel is easy to pick up and use on a basic level, but without careful management, the process of manually analyzing data can become both time consuming and prone to errors,\u201d says Manca. \u201cThe first time I used Tableau, even with no prior experience I was able to create content that would be difficult in Excel. I knew this would be a valuable tool for our editorial team,\u201d explains Manca. With Tableau now in place, the ICIS editorial team has a central data platform where they can conduct in-depth data analysis and continue delivering detailed market insights with ease. In just a few clicks, they can download and compare historical pricing data across any time period they require, further adding to the insights of each report. This data can then be presented using intuitive Tableau visualizations that are easy to understand. Tableau\u2019s use hasn\u2019t ended at the editorial team either. Since implementation in 2016, the number of users has grown to over 600 and includes several ICIS teams including editorial, sales, marketing, analytics, product and technology. \u201cTableau\u2019s ease of use, functionality and visual presentation, has made it a great tool for numerous divisions at ICIS,\u201d says Manca. \u201cIn a short space of time, it\u2019s become essential to nearly every aspect of our operations.\u201d Another key benefit of Tableau for ICIS is the ability to embed interactive visualizations directly into market reports, which are more engaging than static graphs and tables. \u201cAs we transition away from traditional print reports to an information and analytics provider, we want customers to be able to dig deeper into data wherever they felt necessary,\u201d says Manca. \u201cTableau helps us create and embed visualizations directly into our reports, giving customers a different way to digest data.\u201d In the last two years, ICIS has created over 2,300 unique visualizations. Many of these have been embedded into its daily and weekly intelligence reports, where they attract thousands of views and interactions. Manca highlights one example in particular: \u201cIn 2017 we created a Tableau visualization showing the impact of Hurricane Harvey on Texan petrochemical production capabilities,\u201d says Manca. \u201cTo date that viz has been viewed almost 34,000 times by customers all over the world, showing just how important insights like that can be on a global level.\u201d ICIS has also used Tableau to power its innovative Live Supply Disruption Tracker, which offers subscribers invaluable 24/7 insight into all planned and unplanned plant shutdowns around the world that might affect the global petrochemicals supply chain. To do this, the service maps and calculates 132 individual datasets in real-time, encompassing over 43,000 data points in total. The results are then displayed via an embedded Tableau dashboard on the ICIS website. Since its creation, the tracker has captured over 3,000 shutdowns every year. \u201cTableau allowed us to build a fully interactive, real-time dashboard that could be customized to look like an internal ICIS application, which is exactly what we wanted,\u201d says Manca. The application uses color coding to quickly show planned vs unplanned shutdowns, while multiple filtering options allow viewers to refine results based on specific subsectors and drill down for more details on each shutdown as needed. \u201cThe Live Supply Disruption Tracker is a good example of how Tableau has helped us to further enhance our pre-existing data into a new customer offering,\u201d says Manca. \u201cFor an organization like ICIS, where data is a key element to our growth, it\u2019s initiatives like this that further add to our portfolio and future prosperity.\u201d"

        "company": "Certis Group",
        "content": "Certis is a leading security organization providing a suite of services integrating advanced security, facilities management and customer service. In 2017, Certis started an internal digital transformation drive with data analytics as a key component. Vice President of Applied Data Science Samuel Low and his team of data scientists deployed Tableau as an enterprise-wide visual analytics tool. He shares how Tableau helped Certis get more insights out of their data to save time and improve the quality of their services. Customer service is a key priority for Certis, serving a clientele of government agencies and large enterprises in Singapore and across regional markets. Before Tableau, the process of building reports for customers was very manual. Teams had to retrieve data from the database, import it into Excel and churn out Excel reports manually. All this was not only time-consuming, but also provided limited insights. They were unable to analyze their data or drill down to investigate problem areas. With Tableau, the operations team in Certis can now monitor alarm activations and analyze trends. Managers can swiftly identify spikes and investigate unexpected trends in alarm activations. For example, construction work can trigger off an alarm spike. With a monitoring dashboard in Tableau, Certis operations managers can now explain the reason for anomalies. While previously the team could only collate monthly customer reports, they can now engage customers on a more timely and frequent basis, improving the quality of their services. Tableau has also helped Certis save costs and improve productivity across different departments. One example is the carpark enforcement project commissioned by the Singapore government to ensure that parking wardens patrol their carparks a certain number of times a day. Samuel and his data science team created a real-time dashboard to monitor daily progress and send out alerts to the wardens when lapses are detected in certain areas. This helps Certis save costs by reducing penalties, and also save man hours. Previously, operations managers had to manually scan through spreadsheets to identify carparks that were missed out, taking up to five hours each day, shares Samuel. \u201cNow with Tableau, everything is instant and they are able to analyze the data in a matter of minutes.\u201d Another successful project with Tableau is procurement analytics. Samuel and his team built a compliance checking engine and visualized the generated data in Tableau. The procurement team uses Tableau to track company purchases and ensure they fall within certain expense limits. Helping business units comply enables the company to reduce potential costs pre-auditing. The Tableau dashboard has also helped the team analyze purchase trends and adjust approval limits and purchase categories when needed to reduce time spent on getting approvals. As part of the digitalization drive in Certis, all business units have started to use Tableau in their work. Among the 1,000 management and professional staff at the Certis head office, more than 200 are trained in Tableau and now serve as Tableau champions within their teams. The growing culture of self-service analytics within Certis frees up time and resources for the data science team to focus on more advanced analytics projects. A truly gratifying moment for the data science team was when one of the operations departments used Tableau to develop their own customer reports on their own, without any assistance. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hand-hold them at all, and they did everything from scratch, on their own,\u201d shares Samuel. The data science team even conducted their own internal Tableau clinic within Certis, where the more proficient Tableau users asked questions about more advanced concepts like joins, and when to use a certain viz versus others. \u201cSo I think we are really starting to see the fruits of our labor in this digitalization drive. Tableau has helped us empower people with self-service analytics,\u201d says Samuel. Moving forward, Samuel plans to further improve the quality of insights Certis gets from Tableau, and foster greater collaboration among teams through conversations with data. \u201cAn operations-heavy organization like Certis generates a lot of data every day. Data is part of our everyday life, but it\u2019s about getting more value out of it to maximize competitive advantage,\u201d says Samuel. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where Tableau\u2019s data visualization and ease of doing analytics comes in.\u201d"

        "title": "RollMaster's cloud solution with Tableau analytics, sees ROI in just six months",
        "company": "RollMaster Software",
        "content": "RollMaster is a leader in cloud-based flooring software, serving hundreds of dealers that comprise more than 1,500 locations across the United States and Canada. Its core ERP system and dozens of integrated products help flooring customers to be more profitable while managing everything from inventory and purchase orders to sales, accounting, and other financials. Part of what makes RollMaster a leader in the industry is its early investment in the cloud. The company has been hosting solutions in the cloud for more than 12 years\u2014or, as Vice President Patrick Ferries said, \u201cbefore cloud was cool.\u201d With a deep focus on customer needs, Patrick wanted to offer the best business intelligence experience possible to customers. Rather than building a solution in house, he and his team chose to integrate Tableau\u2019s hosted cloud analytics solution, Tableau Cloud, with the cloud-based RollMaster software. RollMaster developed more than 180 dashboards to provide data-driven insights to its customers as a critical component of their core offering. This not only increased the company\u2019s value to its customers and boosted engagement with its core software, but led to some new business opportunities\u2014including giving the company a competitive edge for larger prospect deals and a new industry benchmarking solution on the horizon. When one of RollMaster\u2019s larger customers implemented Tableau to better explore their data, it gave Patrick an idea: \u201cI could take this kind of analytics experience and make it for the masses. Rather than all of my largest dealers making this investment one by one themselves, I could just build this platform out and make it a marketable, add-on product.\u201d With high expectations for an analytics experience to provide customers, RollMaster chose Tableau over developing a solution in-house. \u201cFrankly, it was a pretty quick evaluation,\u201d Patrick shared. \u201cOnce we saw Tableau\u2019s interactivity and how easily you can drill in and out of data components, we were quick to realize that we can\u2019t build these capabilities ourselves\u2014it would just be a never-ending project with full-time programmers. So why not just buy the best tool for the job?\u201d To get Tableau Cloud integrated and to market, RollMaster hired an independent consultant. This resulted in minimal costs and effect on staffing, which was helpful because the organization didn\u2019t want to invest their own developers\u2019 time in the project, nor did they have the immediate expertise to deliver the dashboards and functionality they knew would provide the most value to their customers. RollMaster was able to launch the new analytics solution with Tableau Cloud in less than three months. Patrick expected that only the top-tier dealers would be interested in an analytics add-on product, but was surprised to see customers of all sizes quickly adopting the new solution. Expecting a two-year payback on the investment, RollMaster began seeing a return on the new analytics solution in just six months. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t expect so many people to want all this data and these visualizations,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cIn hindsight, we wish we would have done it a long time ago. We also didn\u2019t realize it would be this easy to get this level of technology up and running.\u201d Prior to embedding Tableau, RollMaster had a few of their own basic dashboards for customers to analyze their data, but Patrick noticed that customers would dive into his sales reports and then dump them into Excel. He shared, \u201cI never realized how much time people spent on the reports\u2014not just the data outputs, but making reports presentable for upper management, sometimes several hours each week.\u201d In addition to saving customers this reporting time, upper management can see reliable, fresh data daily, rather than a few times each week. Customers also love the modern, self-service approach to BI that Tableau enables with RollMaster\u2019s core products. \u201cMost people just want to consume these reports and drill into them,\u201d Patrick shared. \u201cThey\u2019re able to do everything on their own with little or no help from me or the consultants\u2014and everything is wrapped up with a nice virtual bow on it.\u201d Sometimes customers surprise Patrick with new ways to look at the data that help RollMaster develop new content to continue to add customer value. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a dashboard that we\u2019ve built, they show me how they dive deeper into the data and see things differently.\u201d The impact of the analytics solution can be massive. For example, one customer learned that a sales representative had stopped selling a certain product which resulted in a loss of $100,000. Though they had the data all along, exploring it in a new way through Tableau\u2019s visual interface led them to this insight within just 15 minutes. Even in a niche market, RollMaster is sparing no effort to remain competitive. Though many competitors run QuickBooks, the market needs seem to be shifting as some are investing in embedded BI. Patrick said, \u201cI\u2019m excited we were the first to market with it, and that we\u2019re blowing everyone away with what these analytics can do for our customers.\u201d Patrick also noted that it\u2019s been an advantage when prospects have heard of or even used Tableau. The recognition and familiarity with Tableau capabilities make the RollMaster products more attractive. Being the intently customer-focused organization RollMaster is, Patrick was pleased to put more powerful tools than ever before at his customers\u2019 fingertips. It\u2019s also helped to make RollMaster products stickier. \u201cOur customers get immersed in and really rely on these dashboards,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe analytics have become a must-have\u2014one more thing they can\u2019t live without. So that narrows down the competing platforms they would even consider to replace our solution.\u201d Having powerful, integrated analytics has also opened new doors with larger prospects. It wasn\u2019t long ago that many RollMaster customers didn\u2019t know what BI was, or how it could benefit them. \u201cNowadays, larger customers realize they need a solution with BI already embedded,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel, buying one solution only to require tacking an analytics solution onto it\u2014they want it all in one package. And, having partnered with Tableau, we have a better product to offer than our competitors.\u201d Now that RollMaster has a significant customer base engaged in their cloud analytics platform, Patrick is planning to tap into the \u201cbig data\u201d opportunity at hand\u2014offering data for strategic and competitive benchmarking. By anonymizing its customer data, RollMaster can segment and group its customers and allow them to compare themselves with their peers, see trends in the industry, and even utilize predictive analytics to anticipate changes in the market. Patrick expects this added value to help customers improve their businesses, while creating even more stickiness with RollMaster products and further differentiation. \u201cAdditionally, it\u2019s going to help our partnerships with nonprofits in the flooring community,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can share benchmarking data with industry partners and create tighter relationships.\u201d"

        "content": "Uniper generates, trades, and markets energy on a global scale. Based in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany it ranks among the largest generation and trading companies in Europe, combining a balanced portfolio of technologically advanced large-scale assets with outstanding technical and commercial expertise. At the beginning of 2018 the company completed a major data infrastructure overhaul, which saw the existing data warehouse approach replaced by its new \u2018Atonyx\u2019 data platform that combines the flexibility of a data lake with the powerful analytics capabilities of Tableau. As a result, over 500 employees have been empowered to self-serve their own day-to-day analytics needs, while time to insight has been cut by 70%, leading to faster and more accurate business intelligence across the company. Centralizing all data and analytics through a single platform has also allowed Uniper to eliminate the use of multiple different databases and tools, saving over \u20ac1 million in 2018 alone. Prior to Tableau, employees in data heavy departments such as trading and generation were completely reliant on the IT department for all their analysis and reporting needs. Not only was this both expensive and time consuming, but it created a damaging disconnect between key data insights and those that needed them the most. \u201cThe IT department was a big bottleneck to productivity,\u201d said Rene Greiner, VP of data integration at Uniper. \u201cReports took a long time to come back and when they eventually did, many of them were invariably \u2018not quite right\u2019, causing even more delays and frustration as teams had to go back and ask for them to be done again.\u201d Rene knew that adopting a self-service approach to analytics had the potential to eliminate these issues but doing so first required a major overhaul to the way data was handled within the company. So, in 2015 Rene and his team began a major project to replace the existing data warehouse with a new data lake. Then, following an extensive competitive review process, Tableau was chosen as the sole visualization and analytics solution to integrate with the data lake, forming the new Atonyx data platform, which was opened to employees in January 2018. \u201cWe spent a lot of time looking at all the leading solutions on the market from vendors such as SAP, IBM and Oracle,\u201d said Rene. \u201cIn the end, Tableau\u2019s powerful visualization capabilities, seamless integration and ease of use made it the top choice in nearly every category.\u201d With Tableau in place, over 600 employees can now self-serve their data analytics needs, eliminating reliance on the IT team and keeping data firmly in the hands of those that need it. \u201cUsing Tableau, key teams can pull data, conduct high quality analytics and create visual dashboards in the timeframe that suits them, not somebody else,\u201d says Rene. \u201cAs a result, business intelligence and operational performance have improved across the board.\u201d This new approach to data has also had a significant impact on time to insight across the business, which Rene estimates has been cut by over 70% in some areas. \u201cBefore we transitioned to the new platform, the complex nature of our data warehouse was making it very difficult to produce comprehensive reports and analysis as quickly as needed,\u201d says Rene. \u201cIn key business areas like trading, the faster they can get the insights they need, the more informed their decision making can be. Even small delays can cost the business money.\u201d Now, data can be pulled up and visualized incredibly quickly in Tableau, giving traders, asset managers and many other commercial decision makers the information they need to make the right decisions at pivotal moments. Every user is also able to analyze their data about business success much more closely than was previously possible. \u201cIn the past, it would take almost a full day for the IT department to compile and deliver reports for the previous day\u2019s trading, so by the time the traders got them, they were pretty much redundant,\u201d says Rene. \u201cNow, traders can generate their own report shortly after markets close every day via Tableau Mobile, giving them immediate feedback.\u201d In 2018, massive progress has been also achieved in the Power Generation business, with employees able to access their data through the platform and gain fast insights using Tableau. Stephan van Aaken, Head of Asset IT & Digital Transformation said: \u201cTableau made the benefits of a digitalization program tangible to our colleagues in our power plants. It feels like a revolution, our userbase grew from 0 to more than 300 users within 15 months. Tableau strengthens our compliance as well, as our Tableau server instance provides access to a vast amount of highly confidential asset data. The strict authorization capabilities ensure we can prove that our trading colleagues can only access data in accordance with internal and external regulations.\u201d Moving to a centralized data and analytics model has not only simplified processes and improved data quality, it has also created significant cost savings. \u201cOur new approach has helped us eliminate data silos from across the business, which were costing us money and preventing us from seeing the full picture,\u201d says Rene. \u201cWith all data now stored in our data lake and visualized in Tableau, we\u2019ve already been able to eliminate five legacy data systems and tools that we no longer need, saving us \u20ac1 million.\u201d Over 30 different departments within Uniper now use Tableau for all of their analytics and reporting, including IT, risk management, trading, generation, purchasing, selling and procurement. \u201cIn the last year alone, we\u2019ve connected more than 120 data sources to our lake, all of which can now be accessed and analyzed directly in Tableau by the departments that need them,\u201d says Rene. \u201cThe ability to do everything via a single, scalable tool has enabled the company to truly unlock the hidden value in their data for the first time, which was impossible to do just a few years ago.\u201d"

        "company": "Airlines Reporting Corporation",
        "content": "Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) provides flexible distribution solutions to help airlines and travel agencies connect, grow and thrive. By developing innovative business intelligence (BI) products and services for the global travel community, ARC provides the critical link that enables airlines like British Airways, United Airlines, Air China, and more than 200 others selling tickets through travel agents in the US. ARC helps its customers operate more effectively and grow their businesses by building the world\u2019s most comprehensive data on global air transactions. In 2018 alone, ARC settled more than $94.7 billion in transactions between airlines and travel agencies, representing more than 295 million passenger trips. ARC previously provided customers raw or aggregated air transaction data through tabular reports which was time and resource intensive. Some of the company\u2019s customers lacked internal capabilities to adequately analyze the data. Others requested custom reports from ARC\u2014which, depending on the complexity of the requirements and the ARC team\u2019s workload, could have long development cycles. Providing more accessible analytics and scaling it to different customer groups meant changing ARC\u2019s go-to-market BI product strategy. ARC contacted Tableau to simplify how it presents data to customers and accelerate its speed to market. Now, the company has six Tableau-powered BI solutions, including Airline BI and Agency BI. These products are comprised of numerous dashboards that analyze extremely large amounts of data and contribute to significant revenue streams. Interactive dashboards are available through Tableau Cloud and Tableau workbooks to airline, travel agency, airport and corporate customers. With clear insights, these dashboards afford a comprehensive view of performance, including sales and daily operations, and inform flight schedules and airline network planning. With Tableau\u2019s help, ARC achieves its goals of strengthening customer relationships and enabling customers to make better business decisions. Tableau provided ARC a ready solution to help realize its product vision, which included: Leveraging Tableau, ARC\u2019s Product Design and Data Solutions Team develops new products for airlines and travel agencies to solve business problems and improve operations in less time than before. The ARC dataset used across its Tableau-enabled products represents transactions between more than 235 airlines and more than 12,000 travel agency locations. These transactions comprise more than 295 million passenger trips and 2.4 billion segments annually. ARC previously provided customers with raw data or aggregated, tabular reports using outdated and static tools. Product development cycles took longer than the company liked, so ARC sought a better way to deliver more information to its customers faster. ARC customers rely on accurate air travel transaction data, which can be filtered and analyzed on demand. Using Tableau features such as data blending, drill-down capability, actions and row-level data, and performing those activities quickly, ARC and its customers stay on top of transaction data that can change by the hour. As Shital Sabne, Manager, Product Design/Data Solutions at ARC explained, \u201cThe bullet charts are all over our customers\u2019 daily reports. We save them money and time because they don\u2019t need to direct valuable resources to distilling data. Tableau reports are based on ARC data, so the data can be trusted. It all comes together and results in stronger operations for our customers.\u201d Small travel agencies who may not have the extensive resources of larger competitors, gain critical intelligence and support from products supported by Tableau. Large travel agencies that grow through acquisition often have to blend back office systems and deal with niche analytics tools. In both instances, Tableau delivers tremendous flexibility and time savings. The business will not slow down while IT works on the infrastructure needed to support it. Implementation of ARC\u2019s new, Tableau-driven BI reports started with finance departments and revenue accounting teams. As ARC saw the value customers gained from the data, adoption spread to other functional areas. ARC also saw more meaningful conversations between its account managers and customers, leading to more business. \u201cMany travel agencies didn\u2019t want to take on the creation of in-house analytics teams, so they looked to ARC as a business partner who could provide valuable analytics in an easy-to-use format. Furthermore, they don\u2019t have to compete for internal IT resources,\u201d noted Shital. By infusing their BI products with visual analytics from Tableau, ARC maximized the value of transaction data, created favorable customer responses with global airlines and travel agencies and enhanced valuable, multi-million dollar revenue streams. Now, hundreds of users engage with Tableau through ARC solutions\u2014spanning sales, supplier, account management teams, directors and executives. As an added benefit, it wasn\u2019t necessary for ARC to change their data model, saving both time and costs. \u201cTableau helped us discover some patterns that traditional BI tools\u2014and even some sophisticated statistical tools\u2014would have taken a long time to realize,\u201d said Shital. For instance, the ARC product team incubated ARC Memo Analyzer. The tool helps airlines track and instantly benchmark and analyze costly debit memos, which amounted to $138.7 million in 2018 alone across the 236 airlines that ARC serves. In the coming years, ARC expects its already large data sets to double or triple in size, triggering a migration to cloud-based data storage and analytics. Fast handling of large data sets will be beneficial to other groups within ARC such as the fraud analysis department that needs rapid and accurate monitoring of fraudulent transactions to prevent financial loss and reduce risk. With Tableau-embedded dashboards in its BI products, ARC is demonstrating and improving its value. Customers appreciate and rely on the insights that help them make critical route planning and scheduling decisions as well as relying on the information gleaned from these solutions to negotiate better relationships between travel agencies and their airline business partners. \u201cWe\u2019re using Tableau to allow our customers to build business cases and tell stories with the data\u2014unlocking the business intelligence that was always there, but not visible,\u201d Arun added."

Head of Data Visualization, Immanuel Ambhara, was tasked to create a user-friendly and reliable visualization platform to track business metrics. With Tableau, GOJEK employees no longer have difficulties accessing and making sense of their data, and every business decision is now powered by insights. Before GOJEK implemented Tableau, business users without SQL knowledge found it hard to access and visualize their data for tracking and analysis. As a multipurpose app offering a wide range of services to consumers, the business collects a constant stream of data worth billions of rows from multiple sources. For instance, data from customers\u2019 orders alone contains many different elements, with information about the customers, drivers, merchants, order location and type of merchandise. It was difficult to make sense of the data to identify patterns and anomalies. Tableau enabled the team to integrate many data sources and build a beautiful dashboard from a billion rows of data in just a few clicks. Due to its appeal and ease of use, Tableau is now used to present data at every meeting and discussion. \u201cWe no longer make decisions based on instincts, and being data-driven is now part of the GOJEK DNA,\u201d says Immanuel. \u201cWithout Tableau, we will not have grown as fast as we have.\u201d As Indonesia\u2019s first billion-dollar \u2018unicorn\u2019, GOJEK has scaled its operations beyond home ground and across Southeast Asian markets \u2013 Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. GOJEK analyzes operational data on Tableau to improve their performance and services. With diverse offerings from GO-RIDE to e-payment platform GO-PAY and food delivery service GO-FOOD, the business accumulates several types of data ranging from bookings and conversion, merchant sales and revenue, to mobile user experience. For example, the team tracks driver location data to monitor and improve the effectiveness of their allocation system. By mapping the geo-locations of bookings, they can identify problem areas with low conversion or allocation rates. GOJEK also uses Tableau to track user activity on the mobile app to measure engagement and longevity, and refine consumer segmentation. By analyzing GO-FOOD data, they identified key factors that contributed to cancellations, such as distance, price, restaurant operational hours and drivers\u2019 renumeration. By visualizing GO-PAY data on cohort charts, they could track customers\u2019 dependence on the e-payment platform. These valuable insights have helped the business resolve problems and strive for constant improvement and innovation in their products. Data-driven business strategy has also helped GOJEK achieve competitive advantage and rapid growth in new markets. Tableau's compatibility with a diverse range of data sources makes GOJEK's regional deployment a seamless process. With Tableau, GOJEK can easily integrate their advanced data stack comprising BigQuery, Postgres, Kafka, Google Sheets and Google Analytics, as well as advertising and social media data. \u201cTableau has made it easy for us to expand at scale and speed,\u201d shares Immanuel. \u201cOur analysts in new markets can now focus on solving problems that matter, instead of spending a lot of time reinventing dashboards to track business metrics.\u201d"

        "company": "World Wildlife Fund ",
        "content": "Founded in 1961, WWF is one of the world\u2019s largest independent conservation organizations. Its current global efforts to start reversing the loss of nature by 2030 focus on nine key areas: wildlife, oceans, forests, freshwater, climate & energy, food, finance, governance and markets. WWF uses Tableau to centralize, coordinate and analyze the large volumes of data generated by its 80 offices around the world, enabling better decision making at every level of the organization. Tableau\u2019s intuitive analytics and powerful visualizations also bring conservation project data to life and provides demonstrable evidence of the impact WWF\u2019s work is having on a global level to its five million supporters. A major part of WWF\u2019s analytics activity is providing demonstrable evidence that its active conservation projects are having the intended positive impact. Prior to the implementation of Tableau, doing this in an engaging way was extremely difficult. \u201cNo matter how successful a project is, trying to communicate it through a series of PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets just doesn\u2019t capture the imagination in a meaningful way,\u201d says Samuel Harper, Head of Global Business Systems at WWF. \u201cFurthermore, the laborious nature of manual spreadsheet analysis meant many of the reports we produced were out of date before they were even finished.\u201d Now, Samuel and his team use Tableau visualizations to bring project data to life and showcase the life-changing conservation work WWF does. \u201cTableau\u2019s powerful data analysis and presentation capabilities allow us to create highly engaging visualizations that communicate the true impact of the work we do around the world,\u201d says Samuel. \u201cMany of the visualizations we create are also connected to live data, allowing viewers to interact with the data in real-time, however they see fit.\u201d Samuel and his team have also used Tableau\u2019s inbuilt functionality to create a series of official WWF templates, colour palettes and fonts. Doing so has helped standardize reporting both internally and externally, bringing a new level of professionalism and making the organization\u2019s reports instantly recognizable. \u201cWhether we\u2019re monitoring global palm oil production, tracking Kenyan fishery quotas or logging killer whale sightings off the coast of Alaska, Tableau lets us visualize the data in the most impactful and engaging way possible,\u201d concludes Samuel. As WWF has grown over time, so too has its global reach. The organization now employs over 7,000 staff and has a federated network of 80 offices around the world. With such a disparate workforce, coordinating all the data being produced and keeping everyone connected is an ongoing challenge. Before Tableau, WWF\u2019s global insight team used a combination of Excel spreadsheets reporting and Qlikview analysis for most of its coordination and data analysis. However, the approach relied heavily on global project teams regularly providing them with high-quality data, which wasn\u2019t always the case. Furthermore, the laborious nature of manual spreadsheet analysis combined with Qlikview\u2019s restrictive licensing model soon made this approach untenable. \u201cWWF has employees spread out across a huge geographical area,\u201d explains Samuel. \u201cIn order to operate as efficiently as possible, everyone needs fast access to the latest organizational intelligence and data analysis. Our existing model simply didn\u2019t allow us to provide that at the scale required.\u201d After switching to Tableau, the whole organization is connected for the first time via a single, central intelligence platform that\u2019s both easy to use and accessible round the clock. Not only has this improved data sharing and collaboration across WWF\u2019s entire network, it\u2019s also helped break down local data silos by allowing teams to feed their local project data directly into the platform. As a result, senior management now has a much more comprehensive overview of ongoing activity around the world, leading to better decision making and more accurate funding reviews. \u201cEverything is available in Tableau, meaning we all benefit from greater global insights and information sharing,\u201d says Samuel. Tableau is now the platform of choice for a wide variety of internal activities including social analytics, direct marketing tracking, network reporting and global reporting. Data is refreshed daily, meaning all employees are working from the same information and errors resulting from duplicate data are virtually erased. \u201cWith Tableau in place, spreadsheet-based reporting is a thing of the past,\u201d says Samuel. \u201cNot only is Tableau far more engaging, but a single visualization can be used to communicate the same information that previously took 30-40 Excel spreadsheets.\u201d Many of the Tableau-based reports are also fully automated, meaning Samuel and his team can focus their attention on more strategic organizational analysis, instead of constantly updating and maintaining the same few things. \u201cAs WWF continues to become more and more data driven, Tableau is now one of the cornerstones of our global analytics activities,\u201d concludes Samuel. \u201cNot only has it helped to break down internal silos and connect employees all over the globe, it has brought our conservation work to life and allowed us to work smarter and harder than ever before.\u201d"

        "title": "Affinity Education Group unites a nationwide team with Tableau",
        "company": "Affinity Education Group",
        "content": "Affinity Education Group owns and operates approximately 170 childcare centres across Australia. One of the top three childcare providers in the country, it is a market leader in using technology to build competitive edge. Its advanced analytics and data visualisation capabilities place it at least three years ahead of its competitors. With up to 4,000 employees attending to 100,000 children across Australia over the next five years, Affinity Education needed a single source of truth that could be relied on by all decision-makers from senior executives to childcare centre workers on the ground. Senior Director of Innovation and Commerce Thomas McDade shares their transformation journey with Tableau to drive decision-making and collaboration across all levels of the business through a united vision of data. Affinity Education\u2019s biggest challenge was the lack of a common view across 170 childcare centres nationwide. Business users had limited access to data and were unable to derive their own insights through self-service analytics. Until they implemented Tableau in 2017, business users relied on a very small team of commercial analysts to find answers to their questions from huge Excel files with over a million rows of data. With the help of their tech partner KeyData, Affinity Education created a centralised operational dashboard called Pulse, which provides a single source of truth across all levels of the business. KeyData maintains the data environment and updates the dashboards and visualisations consumed by 400 users throughout the Affinity Education business. From the central dashboard, users can also drill down deeper to get tailored insights, with up to 100 analytical workbooks actively in use by different business units. The dashboard also links to Affinity Education\u2019s key applications such as timesheet and attendance tracking, customer relationship management, human resources, customer pipeline and surveys. Instead of having to look through over 50 applications, information from these different sources is now integrated into one consolidated dashboard. \"Everything we need to know about the business is embedded in one single view,\" explains Thomas. As a result, childcare centre managers are empowered with actionable insights through Tableau, and they now spend up to 70 percent less time looking for information. \"We're reinvesting those time savings back into our centres, our culture, our capabilities and into the children under our care,\" Thomas says. Childcare in Australia is highly competitive with a range of private, not-for-profit and semi not-for-profit operators vying to service the needs of Australian families. The cost of placing a child in care is partially subsidised by the government, depending on the family's income. A common challenge faced by childcare centre operators is retaining customers during the summer months. Every year, as children reach school age, they start to exit childcare as early as November, ahead of the summer break and start of school at the end of January the following year. Before Tableau, Affinity Education\u2019s executives and managers worked with month-old retrospective data. Decision-making was reactive and often one step too late. With Tableau as its centralised reporting tool, Affinity Education now gets freshly updated data and forward-facing insights. They use Tableau to understand which customers are leaving and when, and plan summer programs to keep them in care a bit longer. \u201cWe now know where we\u2019re going to land and have 2 to 4 weeks to influence that to get a better result,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cThat wasn't even possible prior to Tableau.\u201d More than just a reporting tool, Tableau is now completely immersed in the cultural DNA of Affinity Education. Executives and managers across the Group now share a common view of the business. They sit in regular weekly meetings where they \u201cspeak the same language\u201d powered by Tableau. \"We\u2019re looking at the same screens and seeing the same results across the entire business,\" Thomas says. The Pulse dashboard also empowers childcare centre managers to own their results and business outcomes, for they no longer rely on month-old performance data. Instead, they can track their progress in two-hour intervals, rippling into huge cultural impact across the business. Industry analysts suggest the company's investment in Tableau has given it a minimum three-year head start on rivals, translating into real business benefit and competitive advantage. More importantly for Thomas, feedback from executives and managers alike is that Tableau is now indispensable. It is part of the furniture - and fabric - of the company's operations. \"You simply could not turn off Tableau,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is cherished by all the management team. It's 100 percent embedded into our management team and their conversations.\" KeyData specialises in helping Australian organisations unlock the value held in their data, blending modern technologies and methodologies, Subject Matter Expertise and industry best practices. We are passionate about what we do, and our experts strive to offer customer-centric solutions that are effective and scalable, with always the same goal in mind: enable the people making decisions to be timely and reliably informed."

Based in Malaysia, iflix serves millions of consumers across the world\u2019s emerging markets. One of their greatest challenges is the need to create hyper local content that resonates with diverse audiences from Southeast Asia to the Middle East. Global Director of Data Analytics Bruno Gagliardo shares how iflix uses Tableau to make sense of user data across different regions, and transform insights on consumer preferences into meaningful and effective content to retain and acquire customers. iflix started using Tableau in 2017, and more than 350 staff today use Tableau to view and analyze data on a daily basis, from the content team to operations, sales and finance. One of the key insights iflix uncovered from their data was better understanding of audience preferences in different markets, enabling them to craft more original content suited to different local audiences. The iflix product has evolved tremendously from its beginnings three years ago, now offering free ad-sponsored content alongside a subscription-based tier with more local and original productions. Localization is one of iflix\u2019s key strategies, and their content team uses Tableau to track performance of different programs and identify the demographics of their core audience. The content operations team drills down further into localization analytics to understand the performance of each individual regions. The commercial teams use Tableau to track subscriptions and engagement, while the country managers analyze the performance of iflix partners in different regions, such as telcos and distributors. Throughout the business, Tableau has enabled more data-driven decision-making to optimize content and results. Bruno leads a team of data analysts who produce Business Intelligence (BI) reports with Tableau for stakeholders and leadership, partnering with them to enable more data-driven business decisions. Management executives have been very impressed by iflix\u2019s progress in the data analytics space, while external stakeholders such as investors are amazed by the quality of the reports produced with Tableau. This was a big improvement, for their analytics practices were very disjointed before adopting Tableau. \u201cIt was very disjointed in terms of storytelling, so we reshaped the data analytics and access to data with Tableau,\u201d shares Bruno. Now, high-quality BI reports communicate data in a clear and effective manner, engaging all levels of the business from executives to business users. Creating a data-driven culture is the key to encourage people to ask questions out of their data. Tableau played an important role in iflix\u2019s culture by unearthing meaningful data points and insights, which helped more business users see the value of data and ask for more. A key factor enabling this cultural change is Tableau\u2019s ease of use from a user experience standpoint, shares Bruno. Even people who are not fully trained can easily pick it up with the abundance of material shared by the Tableau community online. \u201cI think the value we can get out of data is something exponential,\u201d he adds. \u201cOne data set gives you 1 to 10 insights. However, when you start combining those data sets you get hundreds or maybe thousands of insights.\u201d \u201cThis allows you to drive your business in different manners, and in our case, having access to data enables way more decision-making and key strategy change.\u201d"

        "content": "Originally founded in 1870, de Bijenkorf is an exclusive chain of department stores in the Netherlands. Headquartered in Amsterdam, it owns seven stores across the country and operates a highly successful e-commerce business, specializing in premium and luxury goods. De Bijenkorf first began using Tableau in 2014 to unify disparate data generated through its e-commerce business. Now, Tableau has become an integral part of daily operations for 10 departments, ranging from finance and HR to customer care and risk assessment. Adoption of Tableau has also helped foster a collaborative culture of self-service analytics within de Bijenkorf, with over 150 employees using it to achieve their data needs each day. De Bijenkorf is one of the most established brands on the Dutch high street and enjoys a long heritage in luxury retail, but much of the company\u2019s recent success has come from its thriving e-commerce business. \u201cIn 2009, it was decided to place greater emphasis on our online operations, which resulted in a significant uplift in sales from that side of the business. As part of our premium experience strategy de Bijenkorf has a focus on omnichannel retailing\u201d. says Maarten Schuit, team lead of data engineering at de Bijenkorf. \u201cThere is so much data coming in, managing it quickly was the challenge. A couple of years ago the company was partly relying on Excel spreadsheets for much of its data management. It happened that multiple versions of the same spreadsheets existed across the business. Different e-commerce teams also had conflicting definitions, how to measure sales or of what a (web) visit was, which resulted in internal arguments and uncertainty. The wish was also to integrate, data from things like Google Analytics and ongoing marketing campaigns into the existing Qlikview platform they were using. \u201cThis meant there was ample room for improvement on how accurately we could see how the online business was doing,\u201d says Maarten. \u201cWe knew a better approach to data was needed.\u201d After consulting with e-commerce specialists, de Bijenkorf decided to consolidate all its online business data into a central data warehouse and implement Tableau for visualization and analytics needs. This approach created a single source of truth for the first time, eliminating duplicate data sets and inconsistencies between different teams. \u201cImplementing Tableau quickly provided everyone in e-commerce with the fast access to consistent data sets that they needed,\u201d says Maarten. \u201cEvery team was working from the same information.\u201d Establishing a single source of truth also had a significant impact on a number of other business processes, most notably the time spent in internal meeting times. \u201cPreviously, meetings would take longer than necessary because of unclarity between team members over the data sets they were using and who\u2019s was the \u2018right\u2019 one,\u201d says Maarten. \u201cNow everyone is working from the same set, which means meetings are a lot shorter!\u201d With Tableau in place, many insights that previously went unnoticed can now be quickly identified. In particular, the e-commerce sales and marketing team can use Tableau analysis to uncover new information about buyer behavior and the factors affecting purchasing decisions. \u201cTableau allows the sales and marketing team to correlate sales data with things like social media trends for the first time,\u201d says Maarten. \u201cDoing so helps them understand buyer behavior on a much more intimate level and pinpoint exactly what\u2019s driving sales of particular products. Off course respecting the GDPR guidelines\u201d \u201cOnline trends move fast and without the right tools in place you\u2019ll always be playing catch up,\u201d says Maarten. \u201cTableau provides fast access to the information our sales and marketing teams need to stay ahead of these trends and ensure we\u2019re offering the best products out there, at the right time.\u201d Tableau\u2019s ease of use also lets the team quickly customize different data sources and create new views, based on what will help them get the information they need. \u201cIn just a few clicks, the team can create a completely new visualization if they wish,\u201d says Maarten. \u201cAnd with the data refresh scheduling, it means they don\u2019t spend mornings updating spreadsheets\u201d What started as a side project in e-commerce has quickly spread across the company. Now, 10 different departments in de Bijenkorf use Tableau for their data visualization and analytics needs including marketing, operations, HR, finance, store operations and risk assessment. A key factor in this adoption has been the work of Maarten and his team to encourage self-service analytics amongst employees, using the Tableau platform. \u201cOnce people see Tableau in action, they want to know how it can help them with their own analytics needs,\u201d says Maarten. \u201cRather than just serving them up dashboards and reports centrally, we train them to use Tableau for themselves. With a little bit of help, they can quickly start building their own data sources and creating the dashboards they need to answer their own analytics questions.\u201d The company now has over 150 regular Tableau users and Maarten expects this number to grow significantly. The ability to create standardized reporting templates in Tableau means the more users there are within de Bijenkorf, the more consistent reporting has become both internally within the company and externally to stakeholders and suppliers. \u201cAs the percentage of reporting done in Tableau goes up and the percentage in Excel and other tools goes down, we\u2019re seeing a marked improvement in the overall quality and consistency of output,\u201d says Maarten. \u201cSo more departments are interested in working with this tool\u201d"

        "company": "Australian Institute of Health and Welfare",
        "content": "The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) is Australia\u2019s national agency for health and welfare statistics. By producing high-quality data and reports, AIHW informs discussions and policymaking in health, housing and community services. In February 2017, AIHW deployed Tableau to improve public communication of data, and create a more interactive experience on their website. Scaling from 11 licenses to more than 200 in less than two years, AIHW has become one of the leading government organisations using Tableau. Peter Fakan and Daniel Sjoberg from the Specialist Capability Unit, together with Unit Head Nikki Schroder, discuss AIHW\u2019s efforts to build a passionate community of AIHW staff using Tableau, and create a culture of innovation driven by data. The AIHW needs to communicate to a wide-ranging audience including the general public, as well as groups with more specialised needs such as researchers, government planners and policy setters, health and welfare service providers, and students. This presented a challenge in finding visualisation tools that could present information in a captivating format, cater to specialist data users while still remaining accessible and easy to use across a wide range of skill and data literacy levels. In the quest to find an appropriate tool, the AIHW evaluated 14 tools on the market and found Tableau their preferred product for data visualisation. The AIHW uses Tableau to embed interactive vizzes into online reports. These reports provide insights into a particular health or welfare subject, and Tableau vizzes help to support this by visually communicating statistics, trends, patterns and findings. Evolving from static graphs, tables and Excel spreadsheets, data is now brought to life on the website through rich Tableau visualisations. \u201cTableau has given us the ability to integrate our data more closely with our stories, and to be more flexible in delivering information,\u201d said Nikki, who heads a team that publishes data on housing and homelessness in Australia. Feedback received from the public about the Tableau vizzes has been overwhelmingly positive, commented Peter Fakan. Tableau has been found to be very clean visually and easy to use, and staff are continually encouraged to produce more Tableau interactive vizzes. The key to Tableau\u2019s successful deployment and growth within AIHW is the presence of a strong internal support system for the community of AIHW staff that use Tableau. The Specialist Capability Unit was in part set up to help staff achieve their goals with Tableau. Lead Tableau Support Specialist Peter supports business units by understanding their work requirements, and providing the technical help they need to develop visualisation products in Tableau. A vital bridge between the technical and business areas of the institute, he observed how staff adapted to Tableau easily once they could see the connection to their work. \u201cThe ease of use allows us to put Tableau in the hands of staff,\u201d said Peter. \u201cFor instance, graduate employees got up and running in Tableau, building their first dashboards within an hour.\u201d Tableau\u2019s accessibility as a tool, together with strong technical support to achieve business goals, enabled the AIHW to scale it across a large number of business areas. The other pillar of support within AIHW came from the senior executives, who supported and encouraged innovation, investing in licenses and infrastructure such as their own Server. \u201cThis level of commitment gave us the assurance that Tableau is here to stay for the longer term, and it\u2019s worth learning and investing our resources in,\u201d shared Nikki. Beyond the Institute, Nikki also noted that many staff also appreciate Tableau Public, a space where they can learn from other Tableau users and build relationships in the Tableau community. Peter also coordinates monthly sessions to engage the AIHW Tableau community, highlight outstanding vizzes and share best practices. Staff are also supported through formal internally developed courses conducted by the AIHW\u2019s specialist in-house trainer. With extensive support at their fingertips, AIHW\u2019s Tableau community continues to grow in both passion and numbers. Another major benefit that AIHW has seen with Tableau is how the intuitive and flexible reporting tool\nhelped drive innovation within the Institute. With Tableau, staff take an exploratory approach to data\nvisualisation and think of creative ways to tell meaningful stories from large volumes of data. \u201cTableau is naturally intuitive, which focuses users on the data,\u201d explained Daniel. \u201cSo they\u2019re not thinking about how to use Tableau, but what they want out of Tableau, and the insights they want to share.\u201d On the organisational level, Tableau has also helped AIHW build a culture of innovation. According to Nikki, their decision to implement Tableau \u201ccame at the right time and place\u201d. Previously, the AIHW tended to be more conservative towards new software, and more prescriptive with how the organisation used it. With Tableau, they chose a different approach, letting staff explore and experiment with the tool before deciding how best to use it. This flexible implementation model resulted in up to 1,500 AIHW vizzes shared with the public within a year, and around 6,000 vizzes created internally, changing the way people thought and felt about their work. As part of AIHW\u2019s drive to provide more accessible data that will inform and influence policy and planning to help improve the health and welfare of all Australians, the Institute looks forward to developing new and exciting interactive data products using Tableau. The AIHW is highly motivated by this goal and has developed a culture of innovation to find better ways to meet it. As a key part of this, AIHW will continue to release new and exciting Tableau visualisations."

Head of Analytics at Bazaar247 Satish Menon recommends the right Business Intelligence solutions for his clients and supports them in the data analytics space. He shares how Tableau transformed his clients\u2019 businesses from a traditional gut-based approach to data-driven decision-making, helping them achieve competitive advantage in fast-moving industries. Many businesses adopt an analytics solution to work smarter and achieve time and cost savings, which translates into profits and growth for the business. For Bazaar247, helping businesses understand the value of data kickstarts a long-term and fundamental cultural change that goes beyond an immediate, tangible benefit. \u201cData is an underutilized asset,\u201d observes Satish. \u201cMost organizations do not realize that capturing and analyzing data in the right way can increase their business profits or help them reduce cost.\u201d Data literacy is a key challenge for Bazaar247\u2019s clients, and for the past one year and counting, Tableau has helped bridge the gap for many C-level executives who were initially skeptical about data analytics. \u201cWith Tableau, we are able to immediately compile whatever data they have and visualize it for them on a dashboard. Even with the miniscule time we have taken to develop a dashboard, they realize the tremendous power that Tableau encompasses,\u201d Satish shares. With this new realization, he adds, \u201cThey automatically want more of it, and are now ready to build a data-driven culture.\u201d Bazaar247 works with many retail businesses, and in a price-sensitive and fast-moving landscape, extracting timely insights and performing fast and accurate analysis is vital for success. From inventory tracking to making pricing decisions, Tableau has helped Bazaar247\u2019s clients make a paradigm shift from traditional methods based on instincts to a data-driven approach. For example, Satish shares an example of a retail client in South India who was previously not able to track unsold inventory across more than 80 physical stores. Using Tableau helped them consolidate a single bird\u2019s eye view of the business, achieving inventory cost savings by making informed purchasing decisions. This is a huge value-add compared to previously when they were unable to identify which items were slow-moving, and which vendors offered the best profit margin. In summary, Satish reiterates that it is not only a breakthrough in terms of cost savings, but also the improvement in productivity and the fundamental change towards a data-driven mindset. This new approach to growth has given his clients a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving business landscape. Apart from its present capabilities, what set Tableau apart for Bazaar247 was also its future roadmap and robust support system. From user groups to events and trainings, there are many opportunities for the active Tableau community to gather. \u201cUsers are given preferences in trainings, tutorials are provided and even the Internet is full of support for Tableau,\u201d Satish adds. Moving forward, he also looks forward to Tableau\u2019s progress in implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) in querying and introducing machine learning concepts into data preparation and cleaning. He believes this will make analytics even more self-service and put more power and autonomy into the user\u2019s hands. \u201cAll these things tell us that they are going in the right direction,\u201d says Satish. In the future, he looks forward to Tableau integrating even more data sources seamlessly. \u201cThis is what the future holds for Tableau and it\u2019s all very exciting,\u201d he adds. For Bazaar247, he sums up, Tableau continues to be an engaging analytics partner to work with, helping them empower their clients and transform their businesses. \u201cIrrespective of the domain, data source or technological platform, Tableau just blends.\u201d"

        "company": "NHS Improvement ",
        "content": "National Health Service Improvement (NHSI) is responsible for overseeing more than 250 foundation trusts and NHS trusts, as well as independent providers of NHS-funded care in the UK. It offers the support providers need to give patients consistently safe, high quality, compassionate care within local health systems that are financially sustainable. NHSI began using Tableau in 2014 to connect disparate data sources throughout the NHS, create a scalable and sustainable data model for the future, and enable more employees to self-serve their analytics needs. Since its implementation, the value and accessibility of data has grown significantly. Fast, easy access to information on key target areas allows NHSI to benchmark trusts against each other and quickly identify where improvements can be made, resulting in a better, more efficient NHS for all patients. The role of NHSI is to collate and analyze millions of data points from over 250 UK health trusts, to identify where operational improvements can be made and patient care improved. However, when Mridula Sori, Analytics Development Lead joined NHSI (then known as Monitor) in 2014, there were no dedicated analytics tools or data platforms in place, making it very difficult to see the full picture or effectively do analytics \u201cA lack of data consistency meant different versions of the data were being used across the organization,\u201d explains Mridula. \u201cAs a result, not only was analysis slow to perform, but accurate benchmarking of performance between trusts was very difficult.\u201d Using Tableau and single source of data platform, the NHSI\u2019s analytics hub can now create uniform data sets on key national health target areas in a matter of minutes. All trusts can then access the same data set through custom dashboards and compare their performance against each other, helping to identify areas of best practice which can then be adopted more widely. Mridula cites the National Accident & Emergency (A&E) dashboard as a great example of this. \u201cEach day we receive a report from every hospital containing A&E performance information on everything from the number of ambulances queuing outside to how long each patient waited to be treated,\u201d says Mridula. \u201cThis information is automatically updated in the A&E dashboard in Tableau, giving regulators , winter room operations teams and hospitals a clear, up-to-date view of performance across the whole country.\u201d Mridula highlights Tableau\u2019s ease of use as a key factor in this process, meaning hospital employees with very little Tableau training can easily interact with the dashboard, drill down into data and start asking questions. \u201cBy visualizing the data in Tableau, it\u2019s easy to see which hospital A&E departments are performing best in key areas, sparking more conversation between the trusts about why this is,\u201d explains Mridula. \u201cThis collaboration encourages the sharing of best practice, which quickly leads to higher quality care for all A&E patients.\u201d The same Tableau dashboards can also be used to anticipate future hospital performance by correlating weather or seasonal data with historical performance in the same circumstances. Doing so allows NHSI to identify potential issues and take preventative action where needed. \u201cUsing Tableau and modelling tools such as Alteryx, we are working on more advanced analytical techniques like prediction modelling, to predict surges in demand and plan for better bed and staff capacity,\u201d says Mridula. The nature of NHSI\u2019s operations means data analytics reporting plays a significant role in the day-to-day work of many of its employees. Prior to Tableau, there was huge demand on central analytics team to serve all analytics needs centrally, putting the team under constant pressure. \u201cThe combination of poor data quality and lack of self-service tools meant we had little choice but to create all analytics reports ourselves, which was both time consuming and resource intensive\u201d says Mridula. Following the adoption of Tableau, a major turning point came when Mridula and her team made the last ten years of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data available via a custom developed Tableau tool called HES Browser. HES data consists of billions of data points covering every aspect of care received by every NHS patient. Previously, when a report request came in for specific HES data, it would have to be extracted from the database into Excel, where an analyst would spend several days manually searching for the required information. Now, the HES Browser provides all users with instant access to high quality data sets and built-in report structures, enabling rapid exploratory analysis with the help of visualization tools such as heat maps. Users can then use a simple drag and drop interface to develop their own reports including visualizations, dynamic calculations and custom filters. As a result, all NHSI employees can self-serve many of their analytics needs directly from the HES Browser, significantly speeding up time to insight and reducing the pressure on the analytics hub. \u201cThe ability to build tools like the HES Browser in Tableau has had a fundamental impact on day-to-day operations both for ourselves and the wider NHSI workforce,\u201d says Mridula. \u201cWith so many employees now able to serve their own needs, we can dedicate more time towards achieving our long-term strategic analytics goals.\u201d For NHSI, Tableau\u2019s easy scalability is one of its biggest advantages, ensuring a sustainable data platform for the long-term future of the organization. \u201cThe ability to easily add new users is hugely important to us,\u201d says Mridula. \u201cAs we continue to grow, we need tools that can grow with us and Tableau ticks that box.\u201d NHSI is currently moving into closer working with NHS England (NHSE), which will bring providers and commissioners together for the first time and give a complete view of the NHS systems. \u201cThe ease of use and scalability Tableau offers, combined with deep analytics capabilities, makes it the ideal platform on which to found a sustainable future for both organizations.\u201d The National Health Service (NHS) generates millions of data points every day, on everything from patient wait times and hospital stay durations, through to procurement costs for medical supplies. Before Tableau, much of this data resided in disparate data silos across the organization, making it very difficult to perform effective analysis. Now, all data is compiled, processed and stored in a central Strategic Information Platform (SIP) that connects directly to Tableau, allowing for fast and efficient analysis across key data sets. \u201cBy centralizing disparate data sources and connecting them through Tableau, we\u2019ve significantly increased the consistency of information, as well as the speed at which it can be analyzed,\u201d says Mridula. \u201cAs a result, reports that previously could have taken days or even weeks to compile can now be created in a matter of minutes.\u201d"

As the financial arm of Bajaj Group, one of Mumbai\u2019s largest and oldest conglomerates, Bajaj Finserv is one of the most profitable and diversified non-banking financial companies (NBFC) in India. Head of Business Intelligence & Analytics Infrastructure Nilotpal Gupta shares how data analytics using Tableau helps Bajaj Finserv minimize lending risk and make informed decisions with a single source of truth. As a financial lending institution, risk is Bajaj Finserv\u2019s biggest challenge. Data analytics plays a critical role in ensuring that loans are given to the right customers. Nilotpal\u2019s team does critical risk portfolio analysis with Tableau on a monthly basis, and presents the insights directly to management executives through clear and simple visualizations. This analysis, which used to take up to two to two and a half days prior to Tableau, can now be done quickly within 8 to 10 hours. Bajaj Finserv has an enterprise data warehouse that collects and stores data from various platforms such as their acquisition and co-lending platforms. With such big data sets in disparate forms, business users interpreted the data in their own ways, and there was no unified vision across the business. The analytics team wanted to create a single source of truth, and Tableau helped to simplify that. Building on their enterprise database, Nilotpal\u2019s team created visualizations and shared key dashboards on Tableau Server, where business users could access and do their own slice-and-dice analysis. The single source of truth created with Tableau Server empowered business users with little technical knowledge to access and engage with enterprise data, and make smart decisions based on the insights. Back-end security measures are also put in place to protect customers\u2019 data, so that sensitive information about individual customers is never exposed to business users. Making smart and secure decisions with data is crucial to any financial institution\u2019s success. Summarizing the important role of data in Bajaj Finserv\u2019s business, Nilotpal shares, \u201cIn today\u2019s generation, data is oil. Tableau is a platform which has helped us tremendously.\u201d"

        "company": "Comair Limited",
        "content": "Comair Limited is a leading South African aviation company that operates up to 130 flights per day both domestically within South Africa and regionally around Africa, as a British Airways franchisee and under its own kulula.com brand. Founded in 1946, the company is based at OR Tambo International Airport, Johannesburg, and has focus cities at Cape Town International Airport and King Shaka International Airport. Comair uses Tableau to connect hundreds of data sources around the company, improving business intelligence and enabling more informed decision making. Since its implementation, use of data within the company has significantly increased and a transparent self-service culture has emerged, saving time and improving productivity at every level. Comair collects thousands of valuable data points every day across its operations, on everything from pricing and ticket purchasing to fuel consumption and flight punctuality. Before Tableau, the company relied on Excel spreadsheets to collate and analyze it all. However, with data stored in hundreds of separate sources across the company and no way to bring it all together, key insights either went undiscovered or took so much time to find that they were no longer useful. Liezl Brouckaert, Business Intelligence Manager at Comair, knew that infrastructure lay at the heart of the problem and to improve the organization\u2019s data, a new approach was required. \u201cThe entire company was in Excel hell,\u201d explains Liezl. \u201cThe high number of data silos, combined with a lack of centralized intelligence platform was making it very difficult for the business intelligence (BI) team to deliver the kind of insights the wider business needed, on a timescale that worked.\u201d Now, everything is being connected through Tableau. Diverse data sets can be combined, visualized and interrogated directly within the platform, making it much easier to identify key trends and insights. As soon as Tableau was implemented, Liezl and her team were able to start pinpointing areas where significant cost savings could be made, such as plane fuel consumption. \u201cWhen we started analyzing fuel consumption data across all our flights and destination airports in Tableau, we identified that a 27.5kg fuel saving could be made every time an aircraft\u2019s Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) wasn\u2019t started after landing. Based on local fuel prices, that works out to around $14 saving per flight. Across all flights, that becomes $1,610 per day and over a full year, the savings could be more than $587,000.\u201d Fuel is Comair\u2019s biggest expense, accounting for 23% of total costs, so savings on this scale can have a significant impact on its bottom line. \u201cIn the airline industry, small savings can quickly add up,\u201d says Liezl. \u201cBefore Tableau we were aware that savings could be made throughout our operations, but they were never visibly available, so could not be easily consumed or acted upon.\u201d Comair has also achieved a number of other data milestones using Tableau. These include the creation of a single dashboard view of data for both Kulula and British Airways brands for the first time, as well as making on-time flight performance available every 15 minutes, on both desktop and mobile devices. \u201cFast access to key business intelligence can greatly improve decision making at every level of the company,\u201d says Liezl. \u201cBetter information leads to better decisions, which ultimately leads to a better quality of service for our customers.\u201d With data infrastructure issues addressed, the next area of focus was synergy between the BI team and wider business. Years of Excel-based analysis issues had led to a disconnect between the two, with the BI team often unable to produce what the other business teams needed, when they needed it. \u201cWith Tableau, we knew we had the means to address legacy issues, we just needed to realign internal business relationships to ensure the analysis being created and delivered was exactly what people wanted,\u201d explains Liezl. The BI team started by conducting business wide research to understand what the main data needs were, before establishing priorities and KPIs. Next, the team used Tableau to provide cross divisional access to key data such as on-time flight performance, CO2 emissions reporting and fuel savings initiatives, putting key information into the right hands and breaking down internal barriers in the process. \u201cHaving the right tools in place means nothing if we can\u2019t deliver the analysis that people need,\u201d says Liezl. \u201cBy taking the time to connect and listen to the business, we were able to provide exactly the kind of insights in Tableau that could make an immediate impact on operational performance.\u201d The final area the BI team wanted to address was the ability of Comair\u2019s employees to self-serve their own data needs, rather than relying solely on analysis provided by the BI team. \u201cOnce we had addressed fundamental organizational data issues, teaching everyone how to make the most of our new analytics capabilities was a logical next step,\u201d says Liezl. \u201cOne of Tableau\u2019s biggest strengths is its ease of use, which means with just a small amount of training, anyone can start to uncover genuine insights by themselves.\u201d A key component of the drive towards self-service was the establishment of Comair\u2019s Data Stewards Programme. This involved the appointment of nine data stewards to reside within the wider business and assist with analytics requirements, as well as promote self-service amongst employees. \u201cInitially, senior leadership wanted all data stewards to reside within the IT team but we fought hard to ensure they were out in the wider business, so they could start building a community of analysts from within.\u201d Liezl goes on to emphasize the importance of using relatable content when seeking the CEO support needed to get new BI programmes up and running. \u201cWithout CEO buy-in, driving a BI programme is close to impossible,\u201d says Liezl. \u201cTherefore, when looking for support, we showed him Tableau dashboards that contained our own company data because we knew that would mean something and improve the chances of buy-in significantly. We are also very lucky that our CEO has a keen interest in data.\u201d Once the data stewards had been identified, training was conducted and standards manuals and Tableau templates were developed to promote consistency. In combination with this, Liezl and her team launched Comair Analytics, providing employees with open access to controlled data sets within Tableau. With the data stewards acting as community champions and employees able to go into Tableau and experience it for themselves, a culture of self-service has quickly begun to emerge across the workforce. \u201cOnce people started to see how easy Tableau was to use and how it could make their day-to-day tasks much easier, uptake really took off,\u201d says Liezl. \u201cNot only has this improved productivity across the company, it has enabled the BI team to focus much more on strategic business analytics projects that can have a real impact on the future success of the company.\u201d"

Chief Data Officer Jacob Wai introduced Tableau to help business users distill better insights from numbers and make data-driven decisions. Since implementation, Tableau has helped MoneySQ maximize time and money with real-time data reporting and decision-making, and improved communication and collaboration between different teams through rich data visualizations. Before Tableau, MoneySQ employees tracked their business targets manually, entering duplicated versions of data into multiple platforms like Excel and other online tools. The process of collecting relevant data and submitting reports to management took at least two days, which meant that the company could only make decisions and roll out strategy changes on a weekly basis. Such delays are a huge liability in a fast-paced and ever-changing financial landscape. \u201cBut now that we\u2019ve got Tableau, people are making decisions on a day-to-day basis,\u201d shared Jacob. \u201cWe have become much more versatile in our product offerings to our customers.\u201d Real-time insights are also critical for effective marketing campaigns. With Tableau, the marketing team can measure the success of TV commercials, as well as the sales conversion rate. Tableau\u2019s drill-down capabilities allow them to analyze the results across different filters and categories, such as television channels, time slots and spend. In many ways, data analytics has helped MoneySQ optimize their marketing efforts to maximize returns on investment. As a financial services company, MoneySQ deals with a lot of numerical data such as credit ratings and credit shifts. \u201cThat\u2019s all fine if you are a data scientist or a statistician,\u201d said Jacob. Unlike the credit team, sales and marketing people find it difficult to decipher the significance behind the numbers. This is where Tableau facilitated and fostered collaboration across different teams \u2013 by bringing data to life through colorful and diverse visualizations ranging from heat maps to bubble charts and bullet graphs. \u201cSo instead of talking in numbers, our sales and marketing teams can now understand the credit team because [the data] is in visual form with different colors and sizes.\u201d For example, the different color and size segments on a bubble chart can help the marketing team derive insights from what used to be pure numbers and statistics, helping them identify critical target segments easily. By transforming inaccessible numbers into an intuitive and appealing visual form, Tableau helped MoneySQ to bridge the gap between different teams dealing with work of completely different natures. With the help of system-integrated partners from Tableau, MoneySQ implemented the whole system within three months, which is a very short time frame in the Hong Kong market according to Jacob. \u201cFor a project size like MoneySQ, it takes around 6 to 9 months. So this is a real victory and a real success for us,\u201d he said. In fact, Jacob shared that he chose Tableau over other competing products because of its powerful data blending capabilities. Instead of the time-consuming traditional methods of data massaging and data transformation, Tableau is able to integrate effortlessly with MoneySQ\u2019s existing databases and sources. What impressed the Chief Data Officer the most was Tableau\u2019s compatibility with less mainstream data sources such as Firebird, one of MoneySQ\u2019s key platforms. \u201cThat\u2019s the strength of Tableau. As well as tying in with our legacy products and data sources, it can also accommodate our future strategic products such as Hadoop and MapR, allowing us to implement a long-term data strategy.\u201d As for MoneySQ\u2019s future plans with Tableau, Jacob hopes that every single user in the company will eventually be able to use Tableau and do self-service analytics for their respective work scopes. With an analytics leader currently in every team ranging from finance to marketing and sales, MoneySQ will continue building a data-driven company culture with Tableau."

In 2016, Gammon Construction adopted Tableau as a reporting and data analytics tool, starting with their finance department. Senior Finance Manager Tim Mak shares his company\u2019s journey with Tableau and how they created a single source of truth to improve productivity and decision-making. The key factor that made Tableau stand out among other Business Intelligence (BI) tools was its user-friendliness. With no programming involved and intuitive drag-and-drop features, general business users were able to get up to speed with Tableau without a substantial amount of training. Starting with the finance team, Gammon Construction scaled Tableau quickly across multiple departments. Within the first two years of adoption, there are now 800 active users across all major functions within the company, which Tim sees as \u201ca proud achievement\u201d for them. On top of the software\u2019s ease of use and cost savings on training, Tim also cites Tableau\u2019s supportive community as a reason for choosing it over other BI tools. \u201cIf you have any questions, you can post in the community, and they usually respond quickly,\u201d he shared. Working with more than 200 data sources, Gammon Construction wanted to create a single source of data which all teams could refer to. However, due to the sensitive nature of certain information, an important concern for them was the ability to customize different levels of dashboard access for different users. On top of safeguarding information, such permission controls also improved productivity by ensuring the right information gets delivered to the right users. Tableau\u2019s data governance capabilities allowed the business to achieve a single source of truth without compromising security. Speeding up the process of getting information to users was one of the business challenges that Gammon Construction wanted to solve, shared Tim. Before Tableau, month-end reports were the main source of information, and they went up to 120 pages. With these static reports, it was difficult to ensure that the relevant information would reach the intended recipients. Monthly reporting was also slow and inefficient, not to mention the cost and environmental impact of printing at least 2,000 pages of paper per month for every report. In response to these challenges, the adoption of Tableau helped Gammon Construction do real-time reporting and analytics on a daily basis. Users have quick access to information, helping them make data-driven decisions. For Tim, this business impact is more valuable than any quantitative metric. \u201cTableau gave our users the focus to make the right decisions \u2013 you cannot put a number to that.\u201d"

To stay ahead of the information age, Origin Energy adopted Tableau on an enterprise-wide scale to create a consolidated source of truth and free up resources for more strategy-focused work. Business Intelligence (BI) Manager Greg Lambert shares his company\u2019s adoption process, and how Tableau has enabled data sharing and analytics at the speed of thought, with zero duplication of effort.                             As a large integrated energy supplier, Origin manages copious amounts of data that is constantly changing. Prior to Tableau, employees were performing complicated operations on Excel such as Excel macros and VLOOKUP. \u201cAs soon as the business wanted to deal with more rows than Excel could handle, you\u2019re up against a wall,\u201d Greg shared. \u201cTableau Desktop came along with the ability to address all of those issues, so that was a real catalyst for using it.\u201d The adoption grew from a specialist group of analysts who began using Tableau Desktop for their own analytical purposes. Managers started requesting for Tableau after seeing its powerful ability to manipulate and drill down on complex data. With a growing need to publish shared data in a controlled way, Greg and his team adopted Tableau Server, which now has 1,700 users on the cloud. To ensure accountability and quality control, the BI team assigned domain stewards to oversee different domains of data in the energy company, ranging from power generation and retail to risk management and finance. These domain stewards set permission controls to ensure security, and Origin business users have to get written approvals from them to access the content on Tableau Server. Origin employees from various departments ranging from sales to finance rely on operational and performance reports in their daily work. \u201cIt\u2019s very up to the minute, and there are lots of people looking at them all the time,\u201d said Greg. From call centre to sales performance data like wins, losses and customer churn, a large number of users consume a broad base of data sets at every moment of the day. With their previous reporting workflow mainly centered on Excel, Greg observed a significant duplication of effort in preparing and presenting financial performance information. There was no single source of reference for managers from top management to the ground level. With duplication came inconsistency, and figures were constantly being questioned. The lack of real-time reporting and publishing capabilities impeded Origin\u2019s ability to make timely business decisions. This challenge pushed the Business Intelligence team to search for a solution like Tableau. In particular, Tableau Server\u2019s \u201ccompleteness of vision\u201d stood out to them. With unified dashboards, business users can now do comparative analysis at the speed of thought.                             Freed from the need to constantly compile figures and check accuracy, Origin\u2019s entire business focus has experienced a paradigm shift. Day-to-day manual tasks are reduced and their processes sped up, allowing teams to focus on strategic work such as business planning and forecasting. For instance, the finance team no longer spends time collating actuals, and they now have more bandwidth to think about budgets and forecasts. Questions that used to take 40 PowerPoint slides to answer at lengthy meetings can now be manipulated quickly by managers to discover crucial insights which they have not even thought of before. \u201cIt\u2019s really that old adage of \u2018I didn\u2019t know the questions I was going to ask until I got here, and now I know I want to ask these questions,\u2019\u201d shared Greg. Now, finance managers can access reports on any day of the month to get the most updated figures in real time. \u201cThat is a complete paradigm shift from where we were with hard-copy financial reports going out towards the end of the month, which people had no time to read.\u201d                             On the technical front, Tableau has also liberated the BI team to investigate untapped data sources and create new information assets for the business. As business users are now equipped to do self-service analytics, Greg\u2019s team only needs to publish qualified data on the Server and let users explore on their own. What this means for them is that they can now focus on the bigger picture. \u201cBecause Origin is an integrated energy supplier, the information we can gather is almost endless. So my team is now free to tap into new data sources and do database preparation on the back end.\u201d Summing it up, Greg said, \u201cIf I were to describe Tableau in one word, it has been liberating for us.\u201d As the use of Tableau proliferates in Origin, working and collaborating with rich data visualizations will become common practice as the energy leader paves the way forward in the information age."

        "company": "Seattle Cancer Care Alliance",
        "content": "Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) brings researchers and cancer specialists together from Fred Hutchinson, Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, and UW Medicine to treat patients diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, breast, prostate, lung, colon, and other cancers. SCCA has care clinics and hospital affiliations to offer oncology and support services as well as survivorship programs. Their analytics team previously relied on Excel to capture and analyze clinic operations data, but this limited the insights they could share with their partners to improve patient care. SCCA clinic staff and operations managers need to concentrate on providing quality patient care but found it difficult to track service effectiveness with so much data to consider\u2014tracking scheduling, orders, and electronic health records to measure clinic capacity, wait-times, patient demographics, treatment space allocation, and more. And with Excel, filtering was limited, so they could only see a small slice of data instead of the full picture. To make data more accessible for clinic and business staff, the SCCA Clinical Analytics team chose Tableau as their solution\u2014to accommodate the needs of both dedicated analysts and consumers of the data, while maintaining the security of patient information and the quality of customer service. With 3,000 licensed Tableau users, SCCA has a secure connection to all data sources for a comprehensive view of clinic operations and patient experience. SCCA\u2019s infusion bays where patients receive blood products, chemotherapy, hydration, and other services had capacity constraints due to the department\u2019s growth and limited space. As SCCA kicked off Tableau use, they wanted to track daily and weekly infusion bay utilization and identify hotspots to try and level load the department and operate more smoothly. Galen Busch, SCCA\u2019s Senior Tableau Developer and Tableau Administrator, says, \u201cTableau helped us discover areas for potential optimization and gauge the success of changes to clinical scheduling, hours of operation, and workflow.\u201d The Clinical Analytics Team, along with the Infusion Services Team, built dashboards in Tableau that measured bay allocation to utilization, and tracked scheduled and cancelled appointments to understand if they were effectively allocating space and resources throughout the day and week to treat patients from different disease groups. SCCA knew when patients checked in and when they left the patient bay, but they also wanted to dig deeper to understand how long patients wait before their drug is infused or how long they wait once infusion stops and they depart the clinic. The Clinical Analytics Team, pharmacy team, and nursing staff aligned to monitor the timeframe during all of these appointment phases with other appointment data like disease category. By analyzing actual treatment time compared to expected time, SCCA was able to identify and investigate instances of longer-than-expected appointments and work to reduce patient wait times. The result is an improved patient treatment experience and smarter use of infusion resources across all disease groups. Having a physician and clinic manager as data champions helped the Infusion Services Team gain traction with Tableau and drove interest in using data across operations. For instance, the clinic manager dove into specific visit types with Tableau to see if they ran longer or shorter than the scheduled time. Then they made adjustments to appointment length to appropriately schedule the visit, eliminate wait time, and better allocate resources and space. With a macro-level view of the average infusion experience and the micro-view of specific patient visits analyzed in Tableau, SCCA understands the patient\u2019s total experience and better identifies opportunities to make improvements to their infusion process and clinic operations. SCCA deals with sensitive patient information so security and HIPAA compliance were critical factors when selecting Tableau. There\u2019s scheduling information collected from Epic, orders and EHR data from Cerner, phone data captured through Cisco, patient satisfaction scores, and more. SCCA uses single sign-on and SSL integration to maintain security for all of their users who access dashboards on Tableau Server and point Tableau to their SQL server where they stage and automate data intake before it is analyzed and shared. Galen regularly publishes dashboards and revisits them to confirm they\u2019re up-to-date, intuitive to users, and that the data is clean. He shares that \u201cTableau has changed perception of our department within the organization. When we have control over what goes into the dashboards and visualizations, it makes for a really good experience for our end users.\u201d The Clinical Analytics Team meets with internal stakeholders to gather requirements, understand their business case, and let the value of the project drive the development roadmap. This way they can deliver data in the best way possible for all users, from infusion nurses to Directors of Clinical Operations. Awareness of their audience before building dashboards and putting controls in place ensures a smooth and secure patient information management process. Developer engagement is a focus for the SCCA Clinical Analytics Team. They regularly engage their development community to foster Tableau understanding and education so adoption scales and they maintain excellence with visualizations. \u201cAs Tableau Administrator, it\u2019s very important to me that we produce sustainable visualizations that can support a large audience whenever possible,\u201d explains Galen. This means thinking about other parts of the business that can benefit from data insights so they get the most value out of analysis time. \u201cPrior to Tableau, we didn\u2019t get to see each other\u2019s spreadsheets and sharing information was hard and somewhat sensitive,\u201d notes Liz. To develop and maintain cross-team connections and understanding, SCCA gave developer licenses for Tableau to all analytics groups including financial analytics, corporate finance, and clinical analytics. They also hold a monthly Tableau roundtable to discuss product enhancements, share work, and solicit feedback. During those sessions, they invite developers from other organizations in the alliance (Fred Hutchinson and UW Medicine) to share their best practices, experiences, successes and challenges. \u201cI think the Tableau roundtable has really brought together our developer community and we\u2019re able to standardize the level of work that we\u2019re producing for our end users,\u201d adds Galen. \u201cUsers who are new to Tableau add so much value; getting fresh perspective on different ways to solve challenges in Tableau can be so refreshing.\u201d As SCCA strengthens their analysis practices to become a modern data organization, having one version of the truth using Tableau across all groups and evolving data prep will remain a priority for analysts, clinic leaders, and program managers. Besides enhancing communication across all analytics teams, data analysis has informed priorities and influenced strategic planning for SCCA leadership. When executives develop and implement their business and program goals, Tableau is at the forefront of metrics conversations. They ask themselves \u201cIs this something we can get in Tableau?\u201d so data underscores their business performance output. Tableau Server houses all SCCA dashboards, allowing leadership to consult visualizations at any time and be confident the data is current. Liz explains, \u201cWe can all be on vacation and I know our data systems will update so visualizations are refreshed each morning for leadership.\u201d They don\u2019t have to ask questions of analysts and wait for a response. It\u2019s all right there in front of them."

        "company": "Abercrombie & Fitch",
        "content": "Abercrombie & Fitch is a leading global apparel and accessories retailer for men, women, and kids through three renowned brands. Merchandise planning for Abercrombie is critical; it\u2019s the art and science of buying product and deciding where to place it across more than 865 global stores and outlets. To determine where to place merchandise, it\u2019s important to accurately interpret customer demand. Abercrombie puts customers and their needs at the center of all they do, and with help from Tableau, they identify key metrics to make sure the right product is available when someone wishes to buy it. Providing a seamless experience between the store and online is first priority to deliver the quality, personal service that customers want. Timeliness is critical to compete in retail and Abercrombie now better understands its merchandise product sales results, as Tableau Server facilitates nearly 6,000 queries across at least 600 people weekly. Shifting to Tableau, the company is working to replace at least 80 percent of Excel spreadsheets used for analysis and arrive at product and customer insights faster. The company can now more quickly identify customer purchasing preferences by selling location. With this clarity and visibility, Abercrombie is reducing information silos and strategically moving to a holistic merchandising approach that supports a personalized, top-notch customer experience. Abercrombie works in the direct-to-consumer space with its hundreds of brick-and-mortar stores and outlets. For any retailer, placing inventory before demand is tricky. Retailers must accurately predict seasonal desired styles and features before a customer sees the product. If they predict incorrectly, it may mean overstock on shelves and in distribution centers or having product that doesn\u2019t match customer preferences. To create a seamless customer experience, all channels must act in unison: \u201cWe try to reach our customer through a full, omni-channel, unified platform so that they can shop who we are, anywhere that they are. We find that the customer who shops through multiple channels is our strongest customer,\u201d explains Daniel Trimmer, Senior Manager of Product Facing Solutions. Using Tableau, merchandising product teams can effectively track sales (size, color, and style), which helps in planning where to place inventory, as well as see what product is in or out of stock. There are shipped sales\u2014sales that occur when a transaction is accounted for\u2014and then there are demand sales\u2014when a customer indicates their intent to buy online and creates demand. Tableau empowers the product teams to take a rear-facing view and alternate between ship or demand sales. Tableau empowers the merchandise planning team to see sales and demand trends that were hard to previously visualize over time and by customer segment. With a clearer picture of transactions and customer behavior, the company can take action on inventory immediately instead of waiting. Before Tableau, sales information was siloed, but having a complete view means faster time to insights and action, giving the company a competitive edge. Today, the team combines product and customer data to determine common links between product and location, allowing the brand to skew product choice and assortments depending on the location of the customer. \u201cTo be able to see trends across time, look at them, and just the sheer amount of data, Tableau allows us to capture it, and as we place merchandising bets, find the anomalies that pop and react to them quickly,\u201d adds Daniel. With a growing business, flexing inventory levels, and more data to explore, the denim team at Abercrombie benefits from Tableau in their merchandising analysis. Customers like different fits, washes, and wear denim for varied occasions. They\u2019ve observed that customer affinity for denim differs from store to store\u2014even when they\u2019re a few miles apart. But capturing that affinity is difficult. Using Tableau, the denim team is making better decisions about the product sent to stores to anticipate what types of products would be most successful in each location. What used to be an informed guess about denim purchases is proven and validated with data. The denim and merchandising teams now see localized activity across all stores using Tableau visualizations. Combining this with customer data, they\u2019re more accurately defining customers by store and attribute tracking (e.g. if they\u2019re more causal, more relaxed). \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. I think it\u2019s creating a huge unlock across our business to take this denim model and fit it in with the rest of the organization.\u201d As early Tableau adopters and Center of Excellence members, Product Facing Solutions (now Enterprise Business Solutions) serves as middlemen between IT and the business. They facilitate effective communication, help drive Tableau adoption and momentum, and work with data scientists to translate data through advanced analytics to achieve business outcomes. Their partnership across groups is shifting the company culture with data-driven decision making and Tableau as a complete enterprise solution. And they\u2019re supported by a devoted team in IT who cleanse the data and ensure it\u2019s consistently up to standards. \u201cOur definition of governance, of how we look at data, has altered in a way. It used to be self-service\u2014get whatever data you want, but we can\u2019t guarantee where it came from\u2014to now building standards and consistency around it,\u201d shares Daniel. Having data scientists at Abercrombie who also use Tableau with other complementary tools to analyze data and generate insights has enabled projects that started, but needed extra detail, to be completed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to take good, core work that was done and polish it off in a way to deliver back to the business, so they can easily, intuitively understand what they need to do for their group\u201d notes Daniel. With data visualization in Tableau and the ability to drill into details, Abercrombie is bringing things full circle so action can be taken and next steps become clearer. The company has a line review process that involves collaboration between executives, business group leaders and product teams during a quarterly meeting to map out goals, understand strategic intent, and determine which products are on trend. Leaders used a set of reports during the meeting that analyzed product performance, but they hinged on using other business intelligence tools, pulling data into Excel, and having many people develop packets that were hundreds of pages long. They didn\u2019t reflect up-to-the-minute information. This one-hour meeting required countless hours of preparation and reports proved ineffective when questions asked couldn\u2019t be answered on the spot. Abercrombie shifted their line review process reports to Tableau. They now prepare for leadership meetings in one-and-a-half days instead of several, and no longer make last-minute changes. With real-time, standard reports, executives and business leaders who want a top-level understanding can effectively act on the data and run the business more efficiently. \u201cTeams have gone from report building to decision making,\u201d explained Daniel. Response by leadership to Tableau and the line review visualizations has been very positive. Just the amount of information that can be consumed in dashboards versus working in small slices of data created interest and enthusiasm. Staying competitive is a top priority, and with clearer insights in hand, leaders make strategic decisions to keep the brand moving forward successfully. \u201cWe\u2019re moving people off Excel spreadsheets on to things where you can actually create insights much faster and get speed to market on the decisions we\u2019re making across the business,\u201d says Daniel."

        "company": "PUBG Corporation",
        "content": "PUBG Corporation started as Ginno Games in 2015, a developer studio under the global game developer, Bluehole Inc. After the global success of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), the name was changed and PUBG Corporation was born. PUBG broke the Guinness Book of World Records in 7 categories, such as \u201cthe fastest million seller on Steam Early Access (SEA),\u201d \u201cthe fastest SEA game to make $100M\u201d, and \u201cthe first Steam game to have over 2M players online.\u201d PUBG Corporation will continue to expand globally to keep up with the rapid growth of E-Sports and Battlegrounds. According to Siyoon Lee, a data analyst, PUBG\u2019s Service Analytics team, \u201cPUBG uses Tableau\u2019s simple visual analytics, superior scalability, and compatibility with existing data to provide daily analytics to offices around the world. Everyone can use this data to make decisions suited to each region\u2019s and team\u2019s needs, and that leads to business growth.\u201d Since it opened in 2017, PUBG has grown rapidly, breaking 7 different Guinness Book of World Records categories. Both users and employees have exploded in number; both data and analytics requests have grown exponentially as well. PUBG adopted Tableau to use its faster analytics process to manage big data and provide useful insights with limited time and personnel. Thanks to Tableau, PUBG is able to quickly analyze diverse game data, create over 100 indicators, and share insights with the whole company. With Tableau, for example, PUBG can create visualizations of daily/weekly user numbers, new/returning user ratio, etc. According to Minsu Jang, general manager for PUBG\u2019s Data Analytics, \u201cPUBG tracks traffic and counts users in real-time. Server status is an example of in-game indicators we monitor to detect and fix issues for performance enhancement. We analyze item balance, such as which firearm users prefer, in order to apply this knowledge to development direction.\u201d PUBG utilizes Tableau to analyze petabytes of databases on premises and through Amazon Redshift and MariaDB. PUBG was able to use Tableau to give users the ability to analyze vast amounts of raw data from a simple browser in just a few minutes, saving time and money compared to previous analytic processes. PUBG leads the E-Sports industry by providing gamers around the world with on/offline gaming events and new content. PUBG introduced Tableau\u2019s analytics platform to make quick, accurate decisions based on vast business and marketing data. The first thing 80% of business and marketing team members do at work is opening the Tableau dashboard, which shows Key Performance Indicators (KPI) such as sales and profits up to the date. Through this, employees are able to find regional differences in KPI and research varied correlations between their rise and fall. Tableau supports not only raw data, but also ad-hoc analytic tools to quickly review why some patterns might appear. Minsu Jang, general manager at PUBG, said \u201cit was difficult to keep track of a game launched on a global scale with basic queries and spreadsheets. But with Tableau, we are able to receive daily updates on sales, profit, game, and user insights, run ad-hoc analytics, and make prompt decisions on a global scale.\u201d Furthermore, with Tableau\u2019s educational resources and intuitive UI, PUBG was able to easily expand Tableau platform within the organization. Siyoon Lee, data analyst at PUBG, said \u201cTableau provides online and offline training for new users to quickly learn how to use the program. Furthermore, the simple UI meant anyone could easily analyze and visually understand the data.\u201d In the gaming industry, the image and perceived value of a game service is paramount. That is why when issues arise in an item or the game, they need to be resolved as quickly as possible. PUBG also monitors user communities to respond to service issues quickly and provide solutions. PUBG\u2018s development team periodically reviews written complaints and utilizes Tableau dashboard to review a set of indicators that point to the source of an error. Youngjoon Ki, a data analyst for PUBG\u2019s Game Analytics team, said \u201cPUBG locates the server, storage, or whatever infrastructure the error occurred in to optimize solutions. Furthermore, we collect points of improvement using Tableau and share it with the whole company to raise awareness on errors that are occurring.\u201d Minsu Jang, general manager at PUBG, said that Tableau\u2019s visualization tools are valuable because \u201cas a game company, we need to make a lot of quick decisions that are difficult to change later. Tableau\u2019s visualization allows the whole company to understand the current situation and to see the direction of improvement. This allows people with different opinions to resolve their differences to reach a decision.\u201d PUBG will continue to use Tableau to involve the whole company in making decisions and improvements."

DNA uses Tableau to consolidate a wide variety of online and offline data sources into a single source of truth, enabling a holistic view of a typical customer\u2019s journey. Tableau has also helped to slash the time its analysts spend creating reports whilst empowering employees across the organisation to self-serve analytics and make better, more informed decisions. \u201cOur customers often visit our online stores first, but sometimes they contact customer service or come into one of our high-street stores,\u201d says Hanna-Mari Blankenstein, Online Insights and Analytics Manager at DNA. \u201cWith Tableau, we can now combine web-based data with data collected offline much more effectively than ever before, giving us a truly holistic picture of every customer\u2019s journey.\u201d The ability to connect all this information together through Tableau has allowed DNA to gain a much deeper understanding of customers\u2019 needs and adapt/develop its services accordingly. \u201cUsing Tableau, we can merge, visualize and analyze customer data every day. Everything can be done in real-time too, meaning that if a customer contacts us, we can quickly see all of their pertinent information in one place and respond to the enquiry appropriately, regardless of the channel it has come in on.\u201d In addition to supporting DNA\u2019s business operations, Tableau has also helped the company achieve its goals of becoming a more data-driven company. In particular, the role of the IT team has shifted from a traditional report factory to preparing high-quality data sources and offering technical support and training. \u201cBefore Tableau, a significant percentage of our analysts\u2019 time went on creating and maintaining business reports that, whilst important, weren\u2019t helping move the business forward,\u201d says DNA Development Manager, Antero Kivi. \u201cNow, employees can self-serve their own reporting and analytics needs through Tableau, which frees up our analysts to provide a much wider range of strategic services to the business.\u201d This shift to self-service analytics has also reduced the bottleneck effect that comes with relying on one team to create reports for the rest of the business, helping to improve overall operational efficiency and increasing speed to insight for everyone. \u201cTableau\u2019s intuitive user interface and visual nature means users can quickly get to grips with it, generating insights right away,\u201d adds Antero. \u201cNow, everyone can be a data expert.\u201d There are over 1,000 regular users of Tableau at DNA, which Juho Ansio, Group Business Controller, attributes to both its ease of use and the fact that employees\u2019 buy-in was secured early on. \u201cOur employees actively participated in the decision-making process right from the beginning, so it wasn\u2019t a case of the IT team simply choosing a new analytics tool on their behalf,\u201d explains Juho. \u201cWe made sure Tableau was the right tool and invested in employee training so users could hit the ground running, which has been an essential part of its acceptance and success within DNA.\u201d The company now consolidates data from all over the business in Tableau, ranging from customer management programs and invoicing to warehouse and store stock levels, enabling more informed decision making and greater support of business objectives. \u201cEveryone at DNA knows what Tableau is and what it can be used for,\u201d concludes Juho. \u201cNow, there is a willingness to make data more available to each other because we\u2019ve all seen first-hand just powerful it can be with the right tools in place.\u201d"

        "content": "Founded in 2017, Hastee Pay is the UK\u2019s first technology solution that allows employees to receive their pay as soon as they have earned it, rather than having to wait until payday. The app-based solution has no cost or impact on company cash-flow, meaning employers benefit from increased productivity, punctuality, and staff retention, while workers can access their pay wherever and whenever they need to. The team behind Hastee Pay uses Tableau to analyze in-app behavior in real-time and deliver clear, actionable intelligence back to employers. Tableau has also cut Hastee Pay\u2019s analysis time from days to seconds. And with Tableau Cloud on Amazon Web Services, Hastee Pay has added flexibility of the cloud, avoiding significant up-front infrastructure costs. Personal finance is a highly emotive market where speed and accuracy of information are paramount. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with other people\u2019s money, there\u2019s no margin for error,\u201d says Peter Ingram, CTO of Hastee Pay. \u201cThe ability to produce fast, effective business intelligence (BI) is playing a pivotal role in the company\u2019s success.\u201d When Peter joined Hastee Pay in December 2017, it was using a combination of Microsoft Power BI and spreadsheet analysis. However, this solution was proving too costly and clunky, meaning one of Peter\u2019s first tasks was finding a more suitable alternative. \u201cWe reviewed several leading analytics and reporting platforms, but quickly settled on Tableau due to its data accuracy, highly visual presentation and real-time intelligence capabilities,\u201d says Peter. With Tableau in place, the company can achieve a wide range of BI goals quickly and efficiently, ranging from in-app user behavior analytics to financial reporting for its client. \u201cUsing Tableau, we can keep our clients updated in real-time on key information such as how much money workers are withdrawing, when they are withdrawing it and how frequently,\u201d says Peter. \u201cThis kind of information is hugely valuable for their financial planning and our ability to provide it instantly through Tableau gives us a big competitive advantage.\u201d Hastee Pay is also able to clearly demonstrate the ROI of its service to clients using Tableau analysis. \u201cIn nearly every company where our solution has been introduced, worker attendance and punctuality has increased significantly,\u201d explains Peter. \u201cThis is because employers can choose not to make pay for a shift immediately available to a worker if they are more than a certain number of minutes late for it. Tableau analysis of in-app data shows that as a result, around 70 percent of workers now arrive early for every shift, to ensure instant access to their pay at the end.\u201d Hastee Pay is a fully digital business, hosted on Amazon Web Services. As such, it was imperative that any intelligence solution used was compatible with this business model. \u201cWe knew that going 100% cloud would give us the flexibility we wanted, without incurring significant up-front infrastructure costs,\u201d says Peter. \u201cTableau Cloud fits into this business model perfectly, allowing us to feed information from our five AWS repositories directly into the platform and instantly start benefiting from the insights yielded.\u201d As a banking grade app, data security and integrity are also extremely important to Hastee Pay. Solutions must offer the highest levels of protection before they can even be considered. \u201cTableau\u2019s enterprise-level security features, such as multi-factor authentication, provide the protection that we need as a business,\u201d says Peter. \u201cFurthermore, we could deploy and configure the entire solution within a matter of days, making the whole process fast and painless, with no downtime incurred.\u201d Before Tableau, internal data was hard to reach and interpret, making time to insight unacceptably slow. \u201cAcross many areas of the business, reporting and analysis were being done manually in Excel, which was time consuming and left many spreadsheets out of date,\u201d says Peter. \u201cSwitching to Tableau has changed all this, with insights that previously took days to uncover now available in seconds.\u201d One area that Peter highlights is the website and its use of AI bots. \u201cWe use AI bots on our website to capture all incoming customer requests for support,\u201d explains Peter. \u201cWe then analyze this information to see if there are particular recurring issues, so we can design them out of the solution in future.\u201d \u201cIn the past, this could be a laborious process, involving combing through many lines of spreadsheet data by hand. Now, this task is automated in Tableau, saving many hours, or even days of manual analysis. Any recurring issues with the solution are quickly identified via a single Tableau dashboard, saving the data team a huge amount of time that can now be spent on more important activities.\u201d As a recent startup, the team at Hastee Pay is small, but growing rapidly. Efficient operation requires all members of the team, from the executives through to sales and marketing, to operate autonomously, without relying on others to get jobs done. \u201cBefore Tableau, data analysis was one of the main hang-ups within the team,\u201d says Peter. \u201cWith only two dedicated data guys, they were slowly becoming a bottleneck on productivity because everyone else was reliant on them to produce insights on behalf of the whole company.\u201d \u201cTableau has changed all this. Its intuitive UI and visual approach means that with minimal training, everyone can control of their own data output and can quickly build reports to suit their needs,\u201d concludes Peter. \u201cThey can interrogate data and make decisions based on accurate insights without relying on others, streamlining operations and greatly improving overall business performance.\u201d"

        "company": "AS Watson",
        "content": "AS Watson (ASW) is the world\u2019s largest international health and beauty retailer with 12 brands including Watsons, Superdrug and Savers. With over 14,400 stores in 24 markets, they serve over 4 billion customers every year. Group Chief Operating Officer Ms. Malina Ngai shares that AS Watson deployed Tableau to perform complex analysis across multiple retail categories, and strengthen collaboration between departments through sharing data. They also aim to gain competitive advantage in the fast-moving retail industry with live data and insights, to drive timely business decisions. Tableau\u2019s interactive capabilities made it easy for AS Watson\u2019s business users to filter and drill down deeper in a sea of data, extracting critical information to answer questions. In particular, Tableau Server helped them streamline their insights generation process. The data extract refresh function allowed users to view the latest insights instantly on the Server, when previously they would have to go through more time-consuming methods like email distribution to share and discuss insights. AS Watson is only at the beginning stage of adopting Tableau, but Malina affirms that they have already seen significant time savings in report generation. With live data mined from automated data extract refresh, they have created a monthly category dashboard visualising category performance, customer behaviour and sales trends. While previously it took a few days just to generate a report for a few selected product categories, they can now complete dashboard reporting for all product categories within a few hours. Across the board, adoption of Tableau in the business has improved the efficiency of business processes by extracting live data and insights, and automating time-consuming manual work. As the world\u2019s largest international health and beauty retailer with an umbrella of different brands under it, AS Watson\u2019s main business challenge was to deploy a flexible analytical tool that could handle the breadth and depth of their business analysis across various departments. Prior to Tableau, ASW used standard reports that did not allow them to slice and dice data. For example, in product-centric analysis, a category report did not allow users to see the performance of sub-categories \u2013 they had to create separate reports instead. Furthermore, these reports were previously created on traditional platforms such as Excel spreadsheets, and users had to plough through full pages of figures to identify relevant insights and patterns, which was difficult and time-consuming. With Tableau\u2019s data visualisation, business users can now obtain relevant business insights by manipulating and interacting with their data. With a single user interface to overlay multiple data sets, Tableau helps AS Watson understand their data better and make timely business decisions in a fast-moving industry landscape. Embedding Tableau into AS Watson\u2019s internal platform also optimised the use of Tableau dashboards within the business. Within a year, nearly 600 employees have become active users of their Tableau-powered platform, WatsonView. People like the convenience of having business insights visualised clearly on the dashboards without having to run the reports manually and waiting for results. WatsonView has also fostered a data-driven culture centered on collaboration within the business. Users can share links to the dashboards they have created with their managers and teams, and these dashboards tell clear and engaging visual stories of data, easing comprehension across the board. Moving forward, AS Watson plans to extend the usage of Tableau to support more retail functions and business units. Their main goal is to gain a competitive edge over other retailers, by integrating internal and external data sources to build new and accessible insights. ASW also hopes to promote a culture of self-service analytics. As Tableau is an easy-to-use software with a shallow learning curve, business users with little or even no technical knowledge would be able to retrieve timely insights from WatsonView, eliminating the need to wait for support from data analysts or the IT department. With effective use of data visualisation, users can identify and highlight areas that require immediate focus, to react more responsively to market situations and competitors\u2019 actions."

        "title": "OVH overhauls data management and creates single source of truth with Tableau",
        "company": "OVH",
        "content": "Founded in 1999, OVH is a global hyper-scale cloud provider, with 27 datacenters on 4 continents\u2014all connected via its own 13 Tbps dark fiber network. It provides its 1.3 million worldwide customers with simple yet powerful products and services revolving around three key areas: Web (Domains, Web Hosting, Exchange), Dedicated (Servers) and Cloud (Public and Private Cloud, VDI, VPS). OVH began using Tableau in 2015 to centralize its data management, streamline reporting and create a single source of truth across the whole business. There are now over 200 regular Tableau users within the company\u2014a number growing all the time\u2014spanning 20+ different internal groups, with the CEO himself overseeing the ongoing rollout to the wider business. For a business like OVH, effective data management and analysis is fundamental to ongoing success. \u201cData is at the heart of our work,\u201d explains Morade El Fahsi, Data Science Team Lead at OVH. \u201cWe are constantly analyzing different types of data to try and predict, anticipate, and determine business strategy for the short, medium, and long term.\u201d Prior to the introduction of Tableau in 2015, the company relied on homemade, open source tools to manage data. However, not only were these tools time consuming to use, they were not companywide. This created a fractured data environment, meaning different parts of the business were often working off different sets of information, causing internal issues. A better solution was needed and OVH\u2019s IT team quickly identified Tableau for its ease of use, direct integration with data sources and powerful visual analysis capabilities. \u201cThe main benefit of Tableau is its flexibility, the capability at any given moment to adapt to an activity, a need, specific tracking, a customer path, or a product that's just been launched,\u201d says Morade. \u201cIn just a few minutes you can quickly set up a new dashboard and start sharing insights with whoever you like.\u201d Tableau also connects all OVH\u2019s data sources in one central location, creating a single source of truth for everyone in the business and ensuring data consistency throughout. \u201cFirst you gather data, process it, and ensure its integrity, then you make it immediately accessible to all employees in Tableau,\u201d says Morade. \u201cThis eliminates the risk of data silos forming and means everyone is working off the same information.\u201d Tableau\u2019s popularity has quickly spread throughout the business. There are now over 200 regular users, spanning 20+ groups across the finance, IT, sales, marketing and service teams, with more requests coming in all the time. Morade attributes much of this to Tableau\u2019s intuitive and visual nature, making it so easy to use. \u201cBeing able to create something that is visually appealing in just a few short clicks means that employees can focus on data analysis itself, rather than the arduous recovery and assembly aspect that was so prevalent before,\u201d says Morade. To help get new users up to speed quickly, Tableau \u2018super users\u2019 have been embedded in each of the departments, where they can give hands on training and help answer questions, without everything being routed back to the IT team. \u201cManaging people is a key part of the process,\u201d says Morade. \u201cWhen new arrivals come in, we explain how Tableau works, what the rules are, what the norms are. Very quickly they are able to self-serve their own data needs, which greatly improves business productivity.\u201d OVH\u2019s CEO has been so impressed by the productivity gains since the introduction of Tableau, he is now personally overseeing the rollout to the rest of the business and wider stakeholders. \u201cWe have already started to introduce Tableau to our supply chain and once that is complete, HR will be next,\u201d says Morade. \u201cWe can see a real gain in productivity, but there's standardization of information too. Tableau guarantees we have the right data in the hands of the right people, at all times.\u201d In addition to data management and analysis, Tableau has also had a major impact on the internal reporting process within OVH. \u201cBefore Tableau, reporting was an increasingly time consuming activity, with hundreds of spreadsheet and PowerPoint-based reports requiring manual updating every day, week or month,\u201d says Morade. \u201cNot only was this taking up a significant amount of the IT team\u2019s time, but the reports themselves were quickly out of date and hard to read, making them difficult to gain actionable insights from.\u201d Now, over 100 of these reports have each been replaced by a single interactive Tableau dashboard that can be easily customized to the requirements of the reader. Furthermore, the reports are fully automated, meaning the time spent on them by the IT team has been significantly reduced, freeing them up to work on more important projects. \u201cRather than having to wade through dozens of pages of data for the insights they need, teams can now quickly manipulate the data however they require in Tableau and display it in visualizations that are easy to read and digest,\u201d says Morade. \u201cThe Tableau data is also \u2018live\u2019, meaning that any small changes made on the back end are available to everyone immediately, maintaining that all-important single source of truth.\u201d \u201cTableau has quickly become an integral part of the data management and analytics process at OVH,\u201d concludes Morade. \u201cOver the coming months, we plan to make every user and department even more autonomous, going deeper with their data and capable of self-serving even the most complex analytical needs.\u201d"

        "company": "State of Tennessee ",
        "content": "The State of Tennessee\u2019s Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD) has a mission to develop strategies that help make Tennessee the top location in the Southeast for high quality jobs. The department seeks to attract new corporate investment in Tennessee from U.S. and global companies and works with local companies to facilitate expansion and economic growth. The department also has a suite of programs which facilitate site development, downtown revitalization, broadband expansion, entrepreneurship, and a variety of other community and rural development initiatives. In early 2015, the TNECD prepared a strategic plan, identifying six key focus areas with long-term objectives, including reducing the number of economically distressed counties in the state, contributing to reduced unemployment and rising incomes. The plan carries through the existing administration, but its objectives and impact will last into the future. To measure progress, the department developed 40 key performance indicators (KPIs). In conjunction they used Tableau to develop a set of dashboards populated with data from their Microsoft CRM system to track the statewide business and community development activities\u2014including new investments in community development and companies relocating to Tennessee\u2019s metro and rural communities. With closer monitoring with Tableau, the department is successfully fulfilling its mission, building out CRM enterprise-wide and elevating transparency with audiences. And now, staff can see how their work directly impacts the state\u2019s economic growth. TNECD uses Tableau to share investment and programmatic information with a variety of audiences, including department executives, commissioners, partners in the General Assembly (who review and approve the Governor\u2019s priorities and budget) and of course, taxpayers. TNECD leadership reports on strategic plan progress on a quarterly basis. Previously, the department used Excel to track against KPIs but data extraction and analysis was inefficient, hindering transparency between the department and external stakeholders. Sally Avery, Director of the Center for Economic Research in Tennessee (CERT), manages the department\u2019s research initiatives and led the execution of the dashboard platform. The dashboards serve to bring the department\u2019s strategic objectives to life in a visually appealing manner. \u201cWe wanted robust data on department activity and economic trends to be available to all stakeholders at any point in time,\u201d explains Sally. When the team migrated to the Tableau platform, they instituted strong data governance standards and expanded their centralized data repository, enabling them to share their progress against the strategic plan. With Tableau, TNECD created customized dashboards for internal and external audiences that demonstrate who is investing in Tennessee and where jobs are being created. The dashboards encompass the entirety of the department\u2019s work, with the option for citizens to drill into community-specific and programmatic details. These dashboards have caught the attention of audiences like county and state government officials and taxpayers, but also national media and government bodies. TNECD dashboards have been cited in the New York Times and The Center for Regional Economic Competitiveness (CREC) recognized TNECD\u2019s efforts as showcasing best practices for other states. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about having a strategic plan that sits on a shelf somewhere,\u201d notes Sally. \u201cIt really brings to life what we\u2019ve set out to do and it\u2019s visible. It helps us tell the Tennessee story of economic growth and community development.\u201d An understanding of state unemployment rate and the impact of job creation coming from business done in Tennessee ranks high on the list of priorities for TNECD. The department analyzes a variety of economic indicators from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the U.S. Census Bureau, and other resources to capture information on employment, income levels, economic distress and other information. Prior to this project, TNECD\u2019s research center manually downloaded this data to create monthly and ad-hoc reports demonstrating changes in economic trends over time. Tableau has enabled CERT to easily share real-time data and trends occurring at a local level to Tennessee communities \u2014a previously time-intensive task. Statistical research specialists at TNECD like Katie Scott now have all that they need in just three clicks. \u201cIt saved me probably half a day of work every month. Before we were copying and pasting formulas a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times,\u201d she shares. In the end, research staff spends more time finding insights and forecasting trends. Miles Hutcherson, a Technical Project Manager with TNECD adds that federal data is so large, Tableau\u2019s county-by-county analysis of unemployment is one of his favorites. Seeing the year-over-year change in Tableau and how it\u2019s improved overall thanks to the business development efforts of TNECD is valuable. \u201cWe can actually go look at that unemployment rate, see how many jobs we\u2019re bringing in, and get excited about the potential for counties to move from a tier 3 to a tier 2 community.\u201d In addition to economic statistics, the dashboards also reflect programmatic activity. TNECD activity reflected in the dashboards ranges across a variety of economic and community development programs\u2014including, for example, a community\u2019s participation in the National Main Street program or Tennessee\u2019s ThreeStar program, preparation of a shovel-ready site, grant assistance for the expansion of broadband, and the recruitment of a foreign-owned company to a rural community. \u201cThis combination of data is incredibly powerful,\u201d says Sally. \u201cIt paints a connected picture between the work the department is doing and the outcomes we work to affect.\u201d As part of the dashboard platform project, the team expanded a Microsoft CRM system to consolidate the department\u2019s programmatic data into one location. In addition to federal statistics, they access this departmental data through Tableau for analysis. TNECD has built numerous visualizations that provide a snapshot of the assistance and project activity the department has engaged in\u2014across multiple programs and communities, as well as over time. One such dashboard\u2014titled the Community Investments Dashboard\u2014gives perspective on TNECD\u2019s community and rural development investments by region and program. Another dashboard portrays the landscape of company expansion and relocation announcements across Tennessee\u2019s counties and industries. Tecora Duckett, a Research Analyst with TNECD, reiterates: \u201cIt\u2019s to let not only our agency know how we\u2019re growing in different areas, and who\u2019s investing in our state, but also allows the public to know who invests in our state and where we\u2019re creating jobs for them.\u201d The department has made the dashboards available to the public. By enhancing transparency into program activities, the department can show responsible use of taxpayers\u2019 funds, building greater confidence with the public and legislators. \u201cIt shows we\u2019re co-investing in rural communities; making them stronger, more viable, and vibrant.\u201d The outcome of such investment also becomes a reduction in the number of distressed counties, which the state of Tennessee is trying to achieve through its programs and initiatives. Every division within TNECD has a separate module in Tableau that is customized to their business and reflects their deliverables. There are status bars on the Tableau dashboards so any staff member, at any time, can click and see how they\u2019re doing. For example, the business development team handles engagement with local Tennessee businesses to identify project opportunities for job creation and capital investment from the private sector. Within that group are nine regional teams that work across the state to capture and analyze data from project activities on a daily basis. In Tableau, ECD management and taxpayers in general can look at average grant levels, economic impact and return on investment metrics to gauge the success of their performance and fiscal responsibility. Ensuring there is real-time visibility into business visits and other metrics also provides more project management agility. The availability of real-time performance metrics enables management to identify inefficiencies and discrepancies and celebrate achievements. Tecora Duckett shared how going from periodic to constantly refreshed reporting has been instrumental. \u201cNow, we actually have time to pull up the data, we can add to it, and help other divisions put whatever they want into our database.\u201d CERT and ECD built dashboards with support from Tennessee department, Strategic Technology Solutions (STS)."

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMC), is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest U.S. banks. The company has grown through mergers and acquisitions with data becoming vital to business operations and strategy\u2014reducing risk, enhancing the customer experience, and offering intelligence to shape future strategy. JPMC made a shift from IT-owned to business-owned self-service analytics to keep up with rapid industry changes and better optimize for business success. But in a highly-regulated environment, IT needed to first establish enterprise governance that balanced data access and compliance. Championed by the Center of Excellence and with IT as enablers, JPMC adopted Tableau, expanding from 400 Tableau Server users in 2011 and approaching 30,000 today\u2014driving enterprise-wide data accuracy. Today, over 500 teams use Tableau to make strategic decisions that are important to the bank\u2019s health. For example, JPMC\u2019s Marketing Operations team analyzes the customer journey, which influences design decisions for the website, promotional materials, and products like the Chase mobile application. Finance and Branch Managers analyze data to support a stronger customer banking experience. And a variety of roles\u2014from Traders, Operations Analysts, Sales, or Risk and Compliance team members\u2014benefit from Tableau\u2019s API capabilities, which support a seamless analytics experience with existing business applications. Business groups wanted to feel empowered to solve problems and answer questions of their own data, while adhering to financial services industry compliance and regulations, along with internal data governance standards. For a long time, the business relied on legacy tools like Excel and SQL Server. However, this ecosystem created inefficiencies and replication of data, resulting in confusion and inaccuracies. With business intelligence solutions like Cognos or Business Objects, it also took months to assess campaigns for effectiveness. A platform balancing IT governance and data access, but addressing business priorities with immediacy, was needed. With new team leadership, IT removed data barriers for business groups and worked with Compliance, Audit, and Risk to develop a governance solution using Tableau. \u201cI would rather create a platform that allows the business to solve their own problems, because we (IT) will never know them all. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve approached our Tableau usage, simply because it allows them to connect to and analyze their own data, which they were already doing,\u201d explained Steven Hittle, Vice President and BI Innovation Leader. Providing Tableau access when people had the desire to try something new, JPMC enabled governed self-service at enterprise scale. The Center of Excellence (COE) team played an important role with adoption and continues to set the vision for Tableau and analytics use across JPMC. Eight individuals trained 1,200 new developers and analysts on the platform throughout all of 2017, creating grassroots momentum and sparking interest that\u2019s led to nearly 30,000 current users. With the COE\u2019s help to motivate and train users with classroom learning and Tableau Days (a full-day session with Tableau sales and bank staff collaborating on Tableau), steady wins occurred and created a positive, virtuous cycle of data analytics. \u201cI think that\u2019s been the biggest contributor to Tableau\u2019s success at JPMC...it evolved from nothing to where we are today because people want to use it, and not because IT went off in a bubble,\u201d reinforced Jason Mack, Director of Analytics. The bank has 18 Tableau Server clusters where they monitor usage, performance, and key metrics to make sure everyone is satisfied, there is sufficient data capacity and efficiencies are realized. By allowing analysts across business teams to question data with Tableau, JPMC has also reduced manual reporting time from months to weeks, which saved thousands of hours and created better enterprise-wide decision-making with elevated transparency. Analysts to C-level executives have gained more time and access to think about data\u2019s impact on the business, have more capacity to innovate and have set more consistent definition of metrics to better understand the journey that customers take with the bank. While business teams reviewed analytics (e.g., measuring account-specific data and retail data), they struggled with viewing the whole customer and their end-to-end journey. Tableau now acts as the front-end for customer analytics and Marketing has built robust data sets tying the line of business relationships like products, marketing, and service touch points with customer data to evaluate overall customer relationship worth. \u201cWe put a Tableau front-end on our robust customer data sets that enable analysts to quickly ask questions like \u2018how many customers have a Freedom and a checking account and use the mobile wallet,\u2019\u201d explained Jason. This arms JPMC with insights to improve customer satisfaction while growing its customer base. When launching campaigns, the Marketing team analyzes population data in Tableau to determine optimal targeting. And the operations side looks at customer journey analytics to understand process breaks. It\u2019s important to see why and where customers abandon an action with the bank or where there are key volumes on channels so product improvements can be made. \u201cThere are call center metrics. There are website analytics. Everything you can think of from a customer experience where we\u2019re trying to improve customer satisfaction,\u201d added Steven. The outcome is quick wins versus putting items on a roadmap to eventually be addressed. Marketing also supports JPMC\u2019s retail branches with Tableau dashboards to better understand their market. For instance, certain dashboards help better prospect small businesses. And they\u2019re delivering greater detail on home sales and realtor activity to inform select programs and customer targeting. There\u2019s now a piloted rollout of Tableau to branch staff such as Private Client Bankers and Home Lending Advisors that will eventually include all 5,300+ branches. When the 2012 economic crisis triggered industry upheaval, focus shifted to increased controls for banks. This tighter regulation strained the relationship, collaboration, and trust between IT and Business. By not having transparent and full trust with line of business data, the cost and risk to JPMC grew, but showing compliance with government regulations was required. The bank\u2019s risk analysis had been done in bulk with Excel, Access, and other tools. This made it difficult to ensure accuracy of the data source and adherence to regulations. To shift this pattern, IT brought along stakeholders from Risk and Compliance to gain support and further spread Tableau. IT trained them on Tableau and data models to foster a healthier, collaborative working relationship. This eventually opened up Tableau for hundreds of Risk users\u2019 benefit with the right governance framework in place. The team uses Tableau Desktop or Tableau Cloud to create dashboards with controlled, compliant data that\u2019s served up on Tableau Server to business teams, managers and executives. In support of the effort, IT created a new cluster called certified self-service, which goes through a more rigorous process to ensure the SQL is correct, and that people are confident the data is authoritative. It\u2019s made up of 18 Tableau Server clusters with 90 distinct sites. With certified self-service, everything is documented with a data dictionary, so on-the-fly decisions can be made knowing it\u2019s a trusted source. IT verifies the data is performing and it meets security control guidelines. \u201cAllowing self-service in one of the most highly regulated spaces \u2013 having the standard platform, the right data controls and the right governance in the tool that captures meta data and provides lineage of it in Tableau \u2013 users love it because they don\u2019t have to wait for IT and IT loves it because they have happy users,\u201d stated Sriram Belur, Head of Business Intelligence Delivery Center."

        "company": "Box Plus",
        "content": "The Box Plus Network is the UK\u2019s no.1 music video network. Featuring seven unique TV channels including The Box, 4Music and Kiss, it regularly collaborates with artists, labels, brands, fans and followers to create exciting content for a monthly audience of over 16.6 million viewers. Among the many applications of Tableau within the business is the use of heatmapping to track and compare viewership across the network, based on time of day and content broadcast. The insights gained directly inform a programming schedule that is appealing to viewers. Tableau\u2019s ability to connect directly to internal data sources has also significantly reduced internal reporting times, whilst making meaningful data analysis more accessible to all employees. As a result, the company has been able to eliminate the monthly costs it previously incurred for external business intelligence services. With the world of TV in constant flux, Tableau is going to be important in meeting these demands. Its relevance is further underlined with 4Music\u2019s recent announcement in March 2018 to expand its programming into the entertainment arena. The strategy is an ambitious challenge to the bigger channels outside of the traditional Music TV space, and a move which has never been attempted by the broadcaster before. For an organization like the Box Plus Network, accurate programme scheduling is crucial. But accurate scheduling relies on accurate data analysis and intelligence, which isn\u2019t easy to achieve without the right tools. \u201cWe get a constant flow of viewing and demographic data across all seven of our broadcasting channels from the Broadcasters Audience Research Board (BARB),\u201d explains Michael Chan, Senior Research Executive at the Box Plus Network. \u201cThe sheer volume of raw data presents a big challenge. A lot of digging is required to unearth insights buried within it and doing it manually was extremely laborious.\u201d Prior to Tableau, The Box Plus Network used basic spreadsheet analysis. While this method was useful, it was incredibly time consuming. Now the network\u2019s scheduling team use Tableau visualizations and heat mapping to easily compare program performance in different hourly slots across the network, quickly pinpointing the best slots for different types of content. \u201cThe ability to compare program performance in such a visual way helps our scheduling team create a compelling line-up of content across the network,\u201d says Michael. \u201cIn a recent review of Tableau amongst our users, something the Head of Scheduling said really stood out. When comparing Tableau to the old way of working, he said \u2018In terms of our chart output, we\u2019re not reinventing the wheel. A lot of what we needed, we did in Excel and then smartened up on PowerPoint, but the point is that Tableau is quicker. Tableau is easier. Tableau just is better to use\u2019\u201d. Another data issue Tableau helped The Box Plus Network overcome is the amount of time spent on reporting within the organization. \u201cBefore Tableau, every report request was dealt with manually by the scheduling team, using Excel,\u201d explains Michael. \u201cData from BARB had to be extracted and scrubbed before it could be analyzed and finally pasted into presentations for the person or team requesting it.\u201d The time-consuming nature of this process meant every report would take at least an hour to create manually. With numerous report requests coming in every day, the team lost an increasing percentage of its overall time to fulfilling them. Moving to Tableau immediately eliminated many of the most laborious aspects of the reporting process and drastically reduced the amount of time required to create each one. \u201cTableau plugs directly into our servers, which means there\u2019s no need to extract or scrub data before it can be analyzed or presented,\u201d explains Michael. \u201cCreating a report now is as simple as defining the required search parameters and creating the visualization you need directly from the data.\u201d Michael estimates that the average time taken to create a new report has been cut from around an hour to just two or three minutes; a time saving of 95 percent. \u201cThe amount of time saved per report is huge,\u201d adds Michael. \u201cReports are automated, so the user gets them 100 times faster. It also gives users the autonomy to access when they want to, rather than wait for a weekly email\u201d Tableau\u2019s ease of use and powerful visualizations are encouraging more and more teams within the Box Plus Network to start self-serving their business intelligence needs. \u201cIn most organizations, data intelligence is seen as a task reserved for the Research team due to its complicated nature,\u201d says Michael. \u201cIn the past, we were the same, but now we\u2019re finding that once people have been introduced to Tableau and what it can do, they are showing more interest in trying to use it themselves.\u201d Michael attributes much of this positive cultural shift to the fact that the Box Plus Network Managing Director, Matt Rennie, is himself an avid user of Tableau. \u201cHaving worked with Tableau before in previous organizations, Matt knew what an asset it could be to the Box Plus Network and he was instrumental in its adoption,\u201d says Michael. \u201cSuch positive reinforcement from the very top has played a big part in how quickly it\u2019s been adopted at every level of the company.\u201d Over half of all staff at the Box Plus Network now interact with Tableau on a regular basis, with many more undergoing training. Michael cites the Music team as a great example of self-service analytics now taking place within the company. \u201cIn the past, the team would ask for data reports that they could use in a pitch with industry music labels. We would then need to extract the data, process it, clean it, analyze it and finally, copy/paste the visuals into PowerPoint. Now, the reports are in dashboards in the cloud, meaning they can log in and access all the up-to-date information they need via Tableau Cloud whilst in the meeting. If the labels need different info, then we\u2019ve set up the dashboards with filters to change the parameters, meaning no more \u2018Let us get back to you on that\u2019\u201d With the Box Plus Network\u2019s business intelligence needs met by Tableau, the company has been able to dispense with several costly third party BI services that it previously had to rely on. \u201cWe used to pay for weekly reports because we didn\u2019t have the capacity to do them all in-house,\u201d comments Michael. \u201cAt the time, we didn\u2019t feel they were providing good ROI, but we didn\u2019t have an alternative. Now we can do everything ourselves in Tableau, plus so much more.\u201d \u201cThe old way of doing things was so labor intensive, we had to choose what tasks we could do and what we had to outsource,\u201d concludes Michael. \u201cWith Tableau we can do everything our suppliers did for us, but faster, on time and on demand. We can create reports quickly, pivot on findings immediately and explore insights as they arise. It saves us time, money and resources. Who wouldn\u2019t want that?\u201d"

        "title": "Hoy AG saves 10,000 man hours per year",
        "company": "Hoy AG",
        "content": "tl;dr Hoy AG, a Swiss advertising technology company headquartered in Zurich, optimizes the print and online advertising campaigns of its customers and takes care of their implementation. This includes - tracking and analysis of success. Due to the high level of report automation with Tableau, the company saves an average of 256 hours of time per employee per year, according to CTO Moritz Schneider. Joint analysis of the most diverse data sources brings new insights that provide the company with more convincing points in negotiations with business partners. Individual dashboards also increase customer loyalty. As Hoy AG runs and optimizes advertising campaigns for customers such as Swisscom, Hornbach and Sanitas, successful campaign tracking and analysis plays a major role in that. Customer advisors and media specialists on one hand need to prove the results of their work with customers and on the other hand use the knowledge gained for optimization of follow-up campaigns. The aim is to achieve the optimal advertising effect with given budgets. To achieve this, Hoy AG collected and evaluated enormous amounts of data that included millions of rows of information about impressions and click or conversion rates from web and social media campaigns. In the past, employees produced their reports and analyses mainly in the form of extensive and complex Excel spreadsheets.. They had to obtain relevant data sets, merge them manually into tables and then calculate and visualize key figures. \u201cIt was a nightmare - especially when, after hours of data consolidation, normalization, and formatting, they finally realized they selected the wrong data. Then they had to restart the entire process,\u201d said Moritz When preparing data, the company also struggled with differently structured data sources coming from the systems of various advertising publishers. This made it even more difficult to combine and calculate key figures. During his marketing studies, Moritz became familiar with and gained appreciation for Tableau. And when the company came across it again with a business partner who had in-depth Tableau expertise, they decided to set up a comprehensive data warehouse based on Amazon Redshift and to analyze it with Tableau. Today, the company's approximately 40 customer advisors and planners draw their reports from the data warehouse, visualize them with Tableau and send them to the customer. Not only has the quality of the evaluations increased dramatically, but the savings in working time is enormous. They\u2019ve saved around 256 hours of working time per employee per year, which is now used for value-added activities \u201cWe were able to eliminate the worthless manual work and spend the time we gained in truly strategic customer service and optimizing campaigns more effectively,\u201d shared Moritz Most significantly, Hoy AG has almost doubled revenues in the last two years, while the workforce has grown by only 45 percent - a clear sign that they can achieve more with fewer employees due to increased efficiencies. Some major customers already have direct access to Hoy AG's Tableau Server. This allows consultants to prepare their custom dashboards with current campaign results or special views in Tableau and then share them directly with their customer contacts. Customers appreciate this transparency because they have not yet received anything like this from another media agency. \u201cThen they're actually working on the same data source on the same dashboard and talking to each other,\u201d reports Moritz. \u201cFor some clients, they can also add comments directly to the dashboard and discuss them with their advisor. This is really cool, because it creates a very nice collaborative process.\u201d There is no question that the high level of transparency and fact-based information exchange has improved customer loyalty. With the introduction of a comprehensive data warehouse with Tableau as the front end, Hoy AG has come a step closer to its first major goal - extensive reporting automation. Now it is a matter of gaining new insights from the data important to the business. They want to better understand what people are working on, and how or where they end up losing or winning money,. For example, they\u2019ve started to compare the performance of different publishers at a fair level. Already, the company has identified and admonished publishers who, by delaying the campaign launches, regularly disregarded advertisers' plans and thus jeopardized their success. The company's flexibility has also increased due to the faster acquisition of knowledge. Report Moritz: \u201cToday, we generally see problems much earlier. If something doesn't work, we can react much faster. In the past, this was not possible due to the long delay in reporting.\u201d Finally, individual employees benefit from having better and more information in the form of more autonomy thanks to Tableau. People are able to make their own decisions based on dashboards because they know the data is correct. This is something we really promote in our company,\u201d summarized Moritz."

        "title": "The ENTERTAINER uses Tableau insights to drive tangible ROI for 10,000 global merchant partners",
        "company": "The Entertainer",
        "content": "The ENTERTAINER is a global loyalty and rewards solutions provider. Partnering with over 10,000 merchants in 15 different countries, it offers consumers exclusive discounts and 2-for-1 offers on a wide range of activities, from dining and spa days to once-in-a-lifetime experiences. Since its foundation in 2001, the company has enjoyed phenomenal growth by virtue of a strong global partner network, a burgeoning corporate loyalty business, and a broad base of delighted customers. In 2013, the company transitioned from print-based voucher books to a digital business model with the launch of the ENTERTAINER App. They had dropped voucher books altogether in 2017. This digital transformation led to a significant upswing in the amount of data the ENTERTAINER could capture from its customer base. The company now uses Tableau to effectively analyze this data, share key insights with merchant partners and work with them to create even better offers for customers. It also uses Tableau to help streamline operations, improve efficiency and proliferate a new data-driven culture throughout the business. As a global loyalty and rewards service provider, the ENTERTAINER places significant value on the caliber of merchant partners it works with and the relationships it has with them. \u201cWithout our merchants, we don't have a product, so keeping them happy is paramount\u201d explains David Ashford, CIO of the ENTERTAINER. \u201cSo, what do our merchants want? They want good quality footfall in a timely manner and for us to provide them with as much information as possible about their customers.\u201d Using data generated through the ENTERTAINER App and analyzed in Tableau, David and his team can build up customer profiles and provide a level of insight to merchants that was never previously possible: \u201cWe have a general policy that we never ask customers anything that we think we can learn for ourselves,\u201d explains David. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll use Tableau\u2019s mapping tools to visualize where a person's sessions are at certain times of certain days of the week, helping us to understand where they live and work, and what they like doing at weekends.\u201d \u201cWe use this data to provide better user experiences, recommendations and customization, but we can also provide it to our merchants, in accordance with the GDPR and DPD data protection regulations.\u201d \u201cWhile we don\u2019t ever provide customer identity, we create different audience subsections and help our merchants to refine their offerings based on insights in each one. For example, analysis in Tableau may show us that women between the ages of 25 and 30 regularly search in the App for restaurants with valet parking, or men between the ages of 40 and 45 often look for restaurants with outdoor cooling. This sort of insight is extremely valuable to our merchants.\u201d Tableau analysis also allows the ENTERTAINER to benchmark its merchants in key categories: \u201cA Spanish restaurant in Bishop's Gate, London, for example, might want to see how it compares to all other Spanish restaurants in London. With Tableau, we can provide this kind of information through our merchant portal. They can then use it to understand how they stack up against the competition and to measure the ROI of being part of the ENTERTAINER network.\u201d This kind of dialogue and flow of information between the ENTERTAINER and its merchants helps to greatly strengthen key relationships and ensure the merchant lineup remains strong, relevant and healthy. Before the ENTERTAINER launched its mobile app, 90 percent of its sales took place through retail channels, meaning the company had very little data on who its customers were. \u201cWe knew something about the 10 percent of customers that were buying from our website, but the 90 percent that were buying the voucher book in their local supermarket, we had no idea about,\u201d says David. \u201cWe also had no idea which of our restaurants or merchants were popular, how many redemptions were being made or by whom. We had very little data at all.\u201d However, as soon as the app launched in 2013, the company quickly found itself with the opposite problem. \u201cRedemption of an offer through the App is perfect data,\u201d says David. \u201cWe get everything we need from an App redemption that we would never get through a print redemption. So as soon as the App was up and running, we started getting all kinds of data coming that we needed to effectively process and analyze.\u201d David and his team began by categorizing the data into three distinct categories, before storing it in relevant databases and data warehouses within the network. \u201cWe've got master data, which is our merchants, outlets and offers, and transactional data, which is user registrations, product sales and redemptions,\u201d explains David. \u201cEverything else we classify as big data, which includes things like App sessions, web analytics, demographics, search, the way people are searching inside the app etc.\u201d Master data and transactional data is stored in a MySQL database, while big data, which is currently housed in MongoDB, is being migrated to a SQL data warehouse on Microsoft\u2019s Azure platform. This means information from all sources can be pulled directly into Tableau for fast, effective on-demand business intelligence and analysis. \u201cOne of the main reasons we selected Tableau over other BI products is because of the capability it has to blend data from different sources,\u201d explains Vicki Gounari, Head of Information at the ENTERTAINER. \u201cIt doesn't need the strict data warehouse that most of the BI tools require, making it much more versatile.\u201d \u201cThe intelligence that we get from Tableau is adding huge value by allowing us to make better, faster, more informed decisions,\u201d adds David. Tableau\u2019s automated functionality has also had a significant impact on the amount of time being wasted on manual reporting within the company. \u201cWe quantitatively classify our merchants on a regular basis, but prior to Tableau we had to restrict this to once per month due to the amount of time the reports would take to produce,\u201d explains Vicki. \u201cWith all the data needing to be pulled from Salesforce and manually curated, it could take up to four man-days to produce each one.\u201d Switching to Tableau has enabled Vicki to automate the entire process, meaning reports can be produced daily now. \u201cNow it's done daily in Tableau, meaning our decision making is far timelier,\u201d says Vicki. \u201cFurthermore, it costs nothing to do because it's all automated.\u201d When the ENTERTAINER decided to go digital, it received investment from a private equity firm along with a value creation plan that was very simple; apply technology into the company to deliver efficiencies, achieve scale, release new revenue streams and increase competitive advantage. \u201cSince I joined the ENTERTAINER in 2012, we've digitized the entire business in just four years to become a pure data company,\u201d says David. \u201cThe insights that we're gathering now on our customers through tools like Tableau [are] enormously valuable and we're realizing new revenue streams all the time with that data.\u201d One of the key steps that David took after joining the company was to create a new department called e-business, replacing the conventional IT department with a forward-thinking group of strategists and data scientists that use IT as an enabler, not a barrier. \u201cWith the creation of the e-business team, we restructured our entire company, shifting the culture and acceptance of change along with it,\u201d says David. \u201cNow our teams get data, they consume data every day, they're hungry for it. We don\u2019t have to try and influence them because they understand its value.\u201d \u201cOnce that culture change took hold, implementing Tableau became a natural next step. It gives people beautiful visualizations and makes it very easy to consume the data they need.\u201d \u201cIn the past, people only wanted basic reports, but with so much app data and big data coming in now, frankly, the only way to understand it properly is through visualizations. That\u2019s where Tableau is really coming to life for us. Now pretty much our entire business is using it in one way or another, in every one of our regions.\u201d"

        "title": "Sony harnesses music streaming data to optimize marketing efficiency with Tableau",
        "company": "Sony Music Germany",
        "content": "Sony Music, one of the world's leading music companies, is radically changing its business with music streaming\u2014and the volumes of data they\u2019re collecting as a result. With so much data, Sony is moving beyond conventional tools to scale and improve analysis for better marketing optimization and efficiency. Ryan Rauscher, Business Intelligence Manager at Sony Music in Germany, explains how Tableau significantly reduced the effort of creating reports despite growing data volumes, and how visual dashboards enable insights for revenue growth and more efficient marketing measures. Many international music superstars are under contract with Sony, and the company is responsible for marketing them. While the business of selling physical recordings is steadily losing importance, music streaming via the Internet is experiencing a meteoric rise. \u201cOne of the most important questions we have to ask ourselves is, where does our money, the revenue in the streaming sector come from,\u201d Rauscher said. In order to answer this question, the company continuously analyzes a wealth of data from multiple disparate sources. \"I would estimate that today we get three to five billion new data points per week from music streaming alone. In addition, there\u2019s data from Shazam and YouTube. But there are also local data sources such as the official chart calculator for music charts in Germany, then radio air play, classic sales figures and chart positions,\" Rauscher said. With the rapidly changing business models, channels and streaming services, all of this new data became a major challenge for Sony to understand, report on and make decisions with. In 2014, Sony introduced Tableau to help them solve these problems. By making self-service data visualizations available to colleagues around the world for daily reporting and decision-making, Sony found more time to be strategic and creative. \"We need tools that allow you to quickly try different things, change reports, interact with the data, try things out. That's why Tableau is definitely the right tool for us to handle this amount of data,\" Rauscher said. After a modest start, Tableau adoption quickly established itself throughout the organization.Today, approximately 2,000 Sony Music employees use Tableau to aggregate and analyze a lot of data in real-time for monitoring and reporting. By centralizing the reporting, the company has found significant time savings for routine work, and has also improved the quality of their insights. \u201cBefore the introduction of Tableau, we had about 30 colleagues in Germany alone, who downloaded figures every day, every week, and converted them back into Excel reports and reformatted them,\" recalls Rauscher. \u201cToday, they can save themselves this time because we take care of it centrally, and in this time [they can] devote themselves to analysis and content. This is, I think, the most important advantage of Tableau: many colleagues can now concentrate on the creative interpretation of numbers instead of creating reports and dealing with the data themselves,\u201d Rauscher said. In the past, reporting at Sony was limited to standard comprehensive performance indicators like sales, profits, chart positions or flat-rate download rates because the data and analysis lived in silos. With Tableau, no matter where the data is coming from, or the complexity of the business, completely new areas of analysis can be explored with Tableau\u2019s interactive data visualization tools. \"We can provide data for all colleagues, and make data-based work and data-based decisions available to individual departments and labels\", Rauscher said. For example, an interactive dashboard not only allows Sony employees to monitor general sales development, but it also allows users to dig into the underlying details of their data to find insight into which department, and why the sales volume was generated, and ultimately improves future marketing decision-making with regard to streaming services.\n\u201cWe see that with many great successful songs, for example, Spotify with its own playlists, sometimes generates more than half of the streaming and revenue. This is a very important insight for us, because we have to align our marketing accordingly.\" Tableau has changed Sony Music's approach to project execution, giving the company greater responsiveness and flexibility in day-to-day operations. \u201cWe have moved away from traditional project management with a long lead time and towards agile work with strong prototyping,\" explains Rauscher. \u201cAll our documentation of the work is built around the Tableau infrastructure, dashboards and workbooks. We sort of re-structured ourselves around Tableau. This helps us to carry out and complete projects faster. I don't want to go back to the world before Tableau.\""

        "title": "Southwest Airlines maintains on-time flights and optimizes fleet performance with Tableau",
        "company": "Southwest Airlines ",
        "content": "With more than 700 aircraft operating at least 4,000 daily flights, Southwest Airlines is the largest carrier of domestic passengers in the U.S. The airline captures data throughout their operations, from planes, airports, customers, crew members, and maintenance. Previously, Southwest's data was siloed and maintained in different legacy platforms, posing a dilemma. Absence of an enterprise-wide view made it difficult to quickly consume, integrate, cleanse and analyze the swelling data, resulting in discrepancies, duplications, and multiple sources of truth. The IT team selected Tableau to enable a culture of self-service analytics at scale and provide a secure environment to explore trusted data, bringing everyone on the same page. Tableau has connected the dots\u2014from maintenance and finance to customer service\u2014and real-time insights are driving efficiencies and casting light on opportunities, like where to add routes or how to reduce gate wait times. Southwest now uses Tableau to capture and engage with the data needed to maintain excellent performance and ensure passengers have successful journeys. Through organic growth, they've scaled from three to 2,900 active Tableau users across 36 departments. As Southwest grew, acquiring AirTran, adding to its fleet, and expanding internationally, they needed to shift to self-service analytics and customized business intelligence that scaled with the business and allowed them to react more quickly to growing data sets. Business groups needed an immediate and accurate understanding of the trips customers booked and flew and whether they arrived on schedule to ensure optimized on-time performance (OTP) and customer satisfaction. Without an enterprise-wide view of their data captured in real-time, Southwest couldn\u2019t see how different parts of operations were performing to asses if they could do better for customers or keep up with competition, growth and change. Previously, to understand their fleet performance, Southwest\u2019s IT team manually pulled data from legacy systems and various sources, including Access, Excel, Oracle, SQL Server, and Teradata, its enterprise data warehouse. With 28 different departments generating and analyzing different data, information was fractured, making it difficult to get a complete picture of their performance. To complicate matters, not everyone had access to the same data, triggering different perspectives and confusion at times. Tom Laney, business consultant with the Data Science Center team noted, \u201cOur enterprise data was siloed all over the place. It was disparate, complex, some varying degrees of messy and clean; it was found in remote areas all over the company.\u201d To connect it all, IT relied on SQL queries, which were difficult to update, maintain, and share. As a result, business groups had trouble integrating, cleansing, analyzing, and consuming the data. With increased demands, Southwest approached Tableau to adapt from centralized data management to self-service analytics at scale. Three users began with Tableau Desktop and published reports to Tableau Server. They socialized their experience and organically grew adoption to more than 2,900 active users on Tableau Server in four years and 400 Tableau Desktop licenses. \u201cAs soon as we started demoing Tableau, anyone who had analytically-savvy minds just had to see it,\u201d explained Tom. The effects on the business were significant; faster time-to-insights helped Southwest quickly spot new opportunities, drive greater efficiencies, and increase time and cost savings. IT supported the development of mini production areas, empowering people to ask and answer their questions through analysis. With Tableau now capturing data from disparate sources and generating dashboards that are automatically refreshed, analysts no longer spent days manually piecing together the data for reports and presentations that were hard to update, maintain, and share with others. The Operational Performance Department that is in charge of tracking OTP is now able to offer a near real-time, company-wide OTP every 15 minutes, tracking performance against historical activity. All photos provided as courtesy of Southwest Airlines. The Technical Operation Fleet Reliability Group provides insights on maintenance and engineering. To manage the overall health of Southwest Airlines\u2019 fleet, the group analyzes data generated by Flight Operations, Ground Operations, Inflight and Technical Operations combined with data from the on-board aircraft system. Unfortunately, Excel and PowerPoint weren\u2019t delivering the analytics that the team needed to address urgent requests and deliver answers about plane maintenance history to ensure the fleet operated at the highest standard. \u201cWe had to do something different because our leadership was calling for more information on-demand versus the \u2018we\u2019ll get it to you in a week\u2019 approach,\u201d said Troy Roskop, Manager of Aircraft Reliability. As Tableau adoption grew for the airline, Troy\u2019s team jumped onboard. In four months, they were using Tableau to author interactive dashboards and embed them in Southwest\u2019s web portal where leadership could go to understand aircraft maintenance history. Southwest achieved a single source of truth for maintenance using Tableau to drill into the data and see if aircrafts met maintenance standards, while also standardizing maintenance monitoring and increasing precision with real-time analysis. Their analysts have cut out days of work, no longer creating new monthly reports, while leadership is satisfied with immediate insights and answers. The Network and Capacity Planning Group works with profitability data to analyze performance across routes, stations, and regions. Previously, this involved quarterly maintenance of a cumbersome, physical profitability binder, reflecting nearly 100 stations and more than 600 routes. It was an ineffective way for leaders to review the information and given the data volume, it quickly became outdated. The team has created multiple visualizations with Tableau, including maps that reflect individual route performance, station performance and regional performance together, which help them make stronger capacity recommendations, including additions of new stations or routes. The team can now easily capture and analyze profitability data for consumption by the rest of the group along with senior leadership. Leaders like Allan Kavalich, Senior Business Consultant, Network Planning and Capacity Planning have experienced massive time savings and improved the effectiveness of day-to-day decisions. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s been nice for my day-to-day job life; I basically have office hours where people from our group come over and I answer Tableau questions.\u201d More recently, the team analyzed zip code trends within customer data to better understand travel preferences for their passengers. They found that several customers favor nonstop flights from a further airport rather than traveling from the closest airport. Customer analysis uncovered new opportunities to add routes in the Los Angeles Basin, and Southwest is now satisfying customers with more direct flights from airports that are closest to their home. Airlines face challenging decisions when trying to optimize fuel capacity because fuel prices vary from city to city. It\u2019s a balancing act and sometimes more cost effective to purchase gas at a lower price and carry it onboard until needed versus having to refuel at a more expensive destination. To offset higher-priced fuel and determine an optimal set of stations that Southwest should use for tankering, the team analyzed all 99 of Southwest\u2019s stations with Tableau. There were many factors involved with assessing cost savings: the price per gallon at each location, cost differences to travel to and from stations, the number of flights each aircraft has flown, and airport fuel constraints. Southwest ultimately discovered the 20 stations with the most potential to support fueling and savings, growing the total savings on tankering. Southwest Airlines has seven reservation centers that handle customer requests and inquiries. These centers are supported by analysts based in headquarters. Recently, Katherine McCloskey, Senior Reporting Analyst in the Customer Support & Services department worked with regional team leaders to create a set of dashboards to track team performance over time. The reporting group consolidated data stored in Microsoft SQL Server and Teradata, along with survey data stored in Microsoft Access and Excel to create a universal view of call behavior. Today, leaders can see real-time feedback on team performance scores and representatives can track their improvement. Around 240 people in a range of roles consume these dashboards. During a recent process change, Katherine caught some outliers in the data. They revealed that the process changes impacted call volumes on another team. \u201cUsing the forecasting in Tableau I was able to catch that with the more resources and calls going into this area, another metric was going up, which was not anticipated,\u201d shared Katherine. \u201cThe teams were able to make the changes necessary to then prevent any problems.\u201d From plane and tarmac staff to the operations leadership and management, a majority of Southwest\u2019s teams now have access to a trusted, secure environment to explore real-time data with Tableau. The company has published over 2,000 workbooks, not only increasing collaboration with data, but improving morale, as people feel greater value and impact from their work. With a modern analytics approach that benefits everyone, the sky\u2019s the limit for Southwest Airlines."

        "company": "Lufthansa",
        "content": "Lufthansa Group is a global aviation group with more than 550 subsidiaries and associated companies. In 2016, Lufthansa generated annual sales of almost EUR 32 billion with approximately 124,300 employees. Lufthansa managers Heiko Merten, Christian Novosel and Fabian Schmick report how with Tableau, they have saved 30% of data preparation time, gained a whole new degree of autonomy in the specialist departments, achieved greater flexibility in decision-making, and established a fact-based decision culture within the Group. Although Lufthansa has been a very analytical and data-driven company for a long time, there was no uniform group reporting in 2016. Heiko Merten, Head of BI Applications in Sales at Lufthansa, remembers: \u201cEach department had its own reporting system and there were no uniform standards. The development of each new analysis had to be formally applied for in the IT department and often took a long time because of the high workload, which resulted in a constantly growing backlog.\u201d In addition, the individual effort for data preparation was very high, so that comparatively little time remained for the real information analysis: \u201cThe original ratio between data preparation and analysis/interpretation of the results was about 80:20,\u201d explains Heiko Merten. At the instigation of the sales department, Lufthansa began searching for a new Group-wide reporting solution. This was a good time to do so, because at that time Swiss and Austrian Airlines also had to be linked to the Lufthansa umbrella brand under uniform reporting standards. The new solution was intended to make the departments more independent of the IT department and to enable extensive self-service reporting. Fabian Schmick, Senior Manager Corporate Strategy at Lufthansa, explains: \u201cOur main focus in selecting the solution was on user-friendliness.\u201d And the company's typical data sources should be easy to connect to. \u201cLufthansa is in a comfortable position because we have many useful data sources in different technology infrastructures,\u201d explains Fabian Schmick. \u201cWe have Teradata, we have SAS, we have Oracle databases that we analyze, but also simple Excel spreadsheets and sometimes\u2014from time to time\u2014we also add external information such as from social media or Flightradar24.\u201d Reporting at Lufthansa used to be mainly paper-based. Reports were distributed and consumed in PDF format. As soon as new questions arose from an analysis, it was necessary to develop a new report. This took a lot of time and cost a great deal of time and effort due to the amount of data preparation. \u201cWith Tableau, it is much easier to consolidate different data sources in a fast and interactive format,\u201d explains Christian Novosel, Head of Strategic BI Initiative at Lufthansa. \u201cWe can now make data-based decisions live in a meeting. Acceptance reaches all the way to the board level with our CFO, who supports our initiative.\u201d The time saved is also enormous. \u201cBy using Tableau, we have been able to accelerate processes considerably,\u201d explains Christian Novosel. \u201cThis allows us to automate and standardize most of the standard reporting. I would say that we now have about 30% more time to dig deeper and carry out analyses that are more specific. In this way, Tableau helps us to analyze the exponentially growing volumes of data and to keep pace with the changes in our industry.\u201d Heiko Merten adds: \u201cWe have now reached a 60:40 ratio of the former 80:20 ratio between data preparation and data analysis. We are on the right track. But my goal is definitely to turn the original relationship completely upside down someday.\u201d In addition, Tableau has introduced uniform standards and key performance indicators throughout the Group. Heiko Merten reports: \u201cNow everyone knows that we're talking about the same thing and the same numbers based on the same 'single source of truth'. This has greatly improved our cooperation across various departments and companies within the group.\u201d \u201cFor us, self-service means that we are becoming more efficient in our day-to-day business,\u201d explains Fabian Schmick. \u201cAnd we can see and understand our data without having to involve the IT department, for example. We want to be able to derive information and interesting insights from it that we were not able to recognize before in order to develop new ideas for our business.\u201d After the proof of concept, Tableau adoption in the company grew rapidly, starting in the sales department and moving across other departments. Within twelve months, Lufthansa evolved from a handful of users to approximately 80 Tableau Desktop users. Today, there are around 500 people who consume Tableau reports and analyses via Tableau Server. Lufthansa benefits from the new solution in the form of greater independence and faster results, especially in the specialist departments. Heiko Merten explains: \u201cNow we are in a much stronger position than before to create and design our own analyses independently. This is well received by the specialist department. And I think that both sides-the IT and specialist departments\u2014benefit from this. A lot of people have now understood the central importance of data for the success of a company like Lufthansa.\u201d Christian Novosel believes that this new rapid decision making will differentiate Lufthansa from the competition: \u201cI firmly believe that this is a decisive competitive advantage for any company and distinguishes successful companies from the others. The provision of these opportunities up to the board level makes the right information available to top decision-makers at the right time throughout their day-to-day business, thus bringing decisive advantages.\u201d Fabian Schmick has also personally benefited from the new solution: \u201cTableau supports me in communicating my messages better. With the help of this interactive platform, I am in a position to answer more questions directly in discussions with management than before. This is a big advantage of Tableau for my daily work in the strategy department.\u201d"

        "content": "NS BlueScope Coated Products is a 50:50 joint venture enterprise between BlueScope and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation of Japan. NS BlueScope Coated Products serves the building construction, manufacturing and home appliance industries with innovative, high quality coated & painted steel products across ASEAN and North America region. The company headquartered in Singapore is into the business of metal coating, painting & roll-forming employing over 3,000 people across the 29 plants in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei and the US employees over 15,000 employees who are tasked with the production of steel structures for building and construction works. NS BlueScope utilizes products and services from Tableau Software for historical, current and predictive views of its business operations through data analytics. NS BlueScope has been able to be up to date with market and business trends, which are important in the development, formulation, implementation, and execution of strategic initiatives as well as for gaining suitably competitive edge over competitors. Consumer satisfaction is an important aspect of any business and in this case, Tableau resonated with NS BlueScope where there is a huge amount of data sitting in multiple different sources. There was no single resource to view or interact with this data. Tableau was the answer for this problem as it allowed for an ease in data consolidation and integrating the data into an easily accessible platform. This consolidation of data prevented inconsistencies and inconveniences that arose due to data duplication, a process that significantly impairs decision-making. In addition, the adoption of Tableau in NS BlueScope allowed it to have a single point of truth within the business with the tool\u2019s ability to structure information models and relevant schemata in a way that the data is not duplicated. One of the key benefits that NS BlueScope saw with Tableau was the significant reduction in man-hours; NS BlueScope was able to register 36% savings in analysis time. Time and money have an intricate relationship in which the two complement each other; in this case, the savings in man-hours meant that more time could be invested in data insights, trends & decision making. Besides that, the adoption and utilization of Tableau services saw significant improvements in decision-making processes in that NS BlueScope was able to get more insight from deeper data analysis. The positive impacts of the analysis are exemplified by the ease in data manipulation, which buttresses the consumers\u2019 statement, that what you make of a tool is what matters in a business setting. Another benefit to the business is that the Tableaus products are user-friendly and intuitive; consequently, there was no need for intensive training among NS BlueScope employees on the use of its dashboards. Across the NS BlueScope business, Tableau has helped to shape the many aspects of the decision-making process and allowed different stakeholders within the business from the senior management to junior employees to consume and interact with this data. Although a lower touch of Tableau among the senior management, these dashboards are utilized during the annual general meetings or during midyear meetings where they rely on its data to make critical decisions. Nonetheless, the other employees across the multiple departments such as the procurement, supply chain management, finance, marketing and budgeting in NS BlueScope use it on a nearly daily basis. An example of the marketing team on how they intend to use Tableau in future will be to monitor consumer behaviours, preferences and purchase history. For quite some time, NS BlueScope experienced tremendous growth in the Vietnam market; nonetheless, with a host of challenges. Consequently, NS BlueScope had to depart from its conventional sources of Business Intelligence; Enterprise Resource Management. Cognos and Excel. The growth in Vietnam led to the need for constant analysis as well as a quest for a solution to data inconsistencies. Therefore, NS BlueScope adopted Tableau which solved the problem of the dichotomy of data, lack of consolidation and lack of consistency in data analytics. With the implementation of Tableau, NS BlueScope was able to streamline IT management and improve decision-making process, streamlining consumer service provision as well as eliminate data duplication problems. Despite several challenges in the implementation of Tableau, NS BlueScope has been able to not only overcome these difficulties but also benefit from the software. However, the benefits of the software far outweigh the impediments to its adaptation. Key among the benefits to NS BlueScope is the better visualization; Tableau provides clear and efficient communication which helps users to analyze and reason about data. Furthermore, the software makes complex data more accessible, usable and secures resulting in better decision making, governance, and enterprise-readiness. Lastly, the adaptation of Tableau Software helped in the initiation of projects that are geared towards organizational efficiency. To start with NS BlueScope will soon commence the development of function specific dashboards that will be utilized by different departments. Such developments are essential in the provision of insight and trends analysis in these departments. Secondly, the implementation of the program has seen the commencement of a data centralization project that seeks to eliminate the problems of not having a joint functionality of data."

Reaching out to 5.9 million property seekers each month via tailored campaigns across various platforms, Domain Group\u2019s Chief Data Officer Pooyan Asgari identified a need for an analytics tool to manage the large pool of data, and yield live actionable insights for strategic business decisions. With Tableau, Domain Group generated substantial business value for their partners and achieved profitable growth in the last five years, setting a precedent for a promising future powered by data analytics. Domain Group\u2019s rapid expansion in the past 5 years amassed a large and rich data pool of more than 20 terabytes of information stored in an in-house data warehouse. Until 2015, data analytics was handled by a specialist team in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) department. The majority of employees had restricted access to company data and were unable to access actionable insights in a timely manner. The implementation of Tableau has turned this model on its head. Following a comprehensive training program for almost all of Domain Group\u2019s 700 employees, the company now has 300 active users of the platform across its sales, product, marketing and strategy teams. More business users are now equipped with the skills and mechanism to explore and interrogate data independently, leading to a significant increase in data-driven decision making. \u201cThe real estate market is one of the most active and dynamic sectors in Australia. Taking a traditional approach to data would have put Domain Group at a commercial disadvantage,\u201d Pooyan said. \u201cThe Tableau platform has given us the ability to access data that\u2019s critical for responsive insight-led decision making.\u201d Domain Group\u2019s sales department plays a vital role in building relationships with advertisers from the real estate industry nationwide. Prior to the implementation of Tableau, Domain\u2019s 200 sales representatives were reliant on the marketing department to provide them with property market insights. Updates were provided monthly or quarterly. Given the dynamic nature of the property market, there was an ongoing information lag as a result. Sales representatives had no facility to request customized reports. On occasion, those created by the marketing team were too generic to be of significant use to clients. The implementation of the Tableau platform gave sales representatives the ability to generate their own real-time insights to share with the 13,000 real estate agents who advertise on the site. Tableau has empowered Domain\u2019s sales representatives to act as trusted advisors and build deeper relationships with their clients. \u201cWe are now able to share these insights with our agency partners to help them hone their marketing campaigns and get better results for their clients \u2013 the millions of Australians who rely on the Domain platform to buy, sell and rent properties,\u201d Pooyan said. \u201cBeing able to access data live has transformed the way we interact with these vitally important partners.\u201d Domain\u2019s strategy department charts the Group\u2019s course in 2019 and beyond. This is no simple remit, given Australia\u2019s rapidly evolving digital landscape and the intensified competition which comes with digital disruption. As the organization\u2019s key source of truth, Domain\u2019s mammoth data warehouse contains key insights to profitable expansion and business improvement. Now equipped with Tableau, the strategy team can independently extract the actionable insights they need to make critical strategic decisions, without going through the data analytics department. A growing culture of self-service analytics helps Domain achieve new milestones in an increasingly competitive property environment. \u201cDomain Group has enjoyed extraordinary growth over the past five years by enhancing the profitability of existing platforms and identifying new opportunities to add value,\u201d shared Pooyan. \u201cBecoming a data-driven business played a key part in this success. Tableau empowered our team to incorporate data analytics into the decision-making process.\u201d"

Navin Advani, Vice President of Enterprise Information Management, highlighted that Sysco\u2019s current state of analytics infrastructure was not fit to deliver that plan. It was plagued by the lack of abilities to analyze large volumes, reporting inconsistencies, long lead times, creeping cost of ownership and scalability, along with stability issues. Navin and team needed an enterprise view of its customers, products, and suppliers that would deliver more intuitive information to internal and external customers through a self-service reporting model, which in turn would ultimately enable revenue growth and operational efficiencies with better data management and better decisions. After Sysco undertook an enterprise-wide transformation exercise, their data and analytics processes morphed and matured. In certain business functions, there has been a shift from consuming hindsight information using row and column-based flat reports to ad-hoc data analysis for deriving insights to support better decisions-and even developing some predictive analytics. This has provided a launch pad to further develop Sysco\u2019s analytics capabilities, driving them to a data-driven culture, and serving as a catalyst for the business intelligence roadmap. With Tableau on AWS, Sysco implemented a \u201cSysco Ecosystem for Enterprise Data\u201d also known as \u201cSEED.\u201d Navin expressed the vision behind SEED\u2013to scale with evolving business needs and provide a foundation for data governance and data security. SEED was cloud native, meaning that Sysco could move from \u201cbuild first and see later\u201d to a more agile and \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d approach towards analyzing business data. Using this approach, they set up the ability to quickly stand up sandbox environments for experimentation. \u201cSEED\u201d was also developed with broad and deep functionality to support a range of use cases across multiple functions including marketing (Churn Analysis, Share of Wallet, ML for future promotions etc.), merchandising (Assortment optimization, Market Basket, Lotting using decision trees etc.) and revenue management (Predictive pricing simulations, Pass thru predictive pricing, Margins review etc.). The agility, governance, cost leverage and discipline that SEED has brought to how data is mined and used at Sysco has delivered amazing results.

        "company": "REI",
        "content": "REI, America\u2019s largest consumer co-op and specialty outdoor retailer, has brick and mortar and digital presence with 150 stores in 36 states and 16 million members. A well-known Pacific Northwest institution with Seattle area headquarters, REI began as a group of 23 mountain climbers and evolved to nearly 12,000 employees. With growth and popularity, REI has quickly accumulated an abundance of customer data. With this data in hand\u2014from transactions online and in-store, operations information and buyer demographics\u2014one primary objective for REI is providing a more personalized customer experience. With Tableau adoption across the organization, supported by a collaborative relationship between business units and IT, REI has streamlined data analysis efforts. Today, teams are more effective at gathering and assessing key customer insights to elevate REI\u2019s impact in the marketplace, driving a better customer experience and influencing business strategy. Like many retailers, REI has an abundance of customer data, equivalent to more than 90 terabytes. The differentiator is REI\u2019s co-op membership. Co-op members contribute to REI\u2019s success and account for more than 90 percent of purchases with the retailer. With members\u2019 active engagement, the co-op has access to critical customer data, leveraging it to create a more personal experience\u2014particularly online. To compete against e-commerce and brick-and-mortar competitors, REI has moved from Excel tables housing billions of rows of data to advanced analytics in Tableau. Today, various teams utilize Tableau dashboards to uncover the most important insights and apply them towards an improved customer experience. The REI team now monitors metrics like: attribution, customer lifetime value, customer and member counts, churn and retention rates, items per order, price per item and frequency of trips across digital and brick-and-mortar stores. By analyzing acquisition, retention, and reactivation metrics in Tableau, teams determine the trade-offs of investing in retail stories versus digital experiences. Based on these metrics, REI teams have also developed enhanced member lifecycle programs to increase customer loyalty and repeat sales. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a complete turnaround in 2017 with new member acquisition,\u201d says Clinton Fowler, Director of Customer and Advanced Analytics. From an operations perspective, the team also uses Tableau to analyze customer segmentations, which inform decisions like shipping methods, member lifecycle management, and product category assortments. \u201cFor REI it's incredibly important for us to think about how we can leverage analytics as a competitive advantage to discover insights and provide a better customer experience for the customers that we've serviced for 78 years\u2014and continue to do so in the future,\u201d explained Clinton. Looking to the future, REI uses analytics to set strategic imperatives and uncover opportunities that will create the greatest impact with customers. \u201cWe've got limited income and limited revenue to actually put towards those investments and so analytics and the metrics are really helping us start to identify what our key opportunities are, where we can get our growth, and we can focus our efforts on those big opportunities.\u201d With Tableau, REI marketing teams analyze customer personas to understand demographic splits by factors like gender or ethnicity. These insights impact everything from the way that REI displays content on its website or targets emails to paid channel strategy. They can also look at the influence of promotions on purchasing behavior and better understand the triggering point in campaigns to determine if they influence more than one purchase. By segmenting its customers and using Tableau to perform an overlay analysis, REI uses the resulting insights to better structure email and direct mail programs and drive more than a 20 percent improvement in both. More importantly, customers receive a more personal experience through REI\u2019s communications. With an omni-channel business, REI sees the value of blending the brick and mortar and digital worlds together for one full view of a customer. \u201cWe see an experience that traverses both channels, so omni-channel analytics is incredibly important to REI,\u201d said Clinton. With Tableau dashboards, REI\u2019s business divisions, from marketing to operations, consolidate data from a Netezza data warehouse, which has over 75 different data sources ranging from point of sale, Google AdWords, FedEx, and more. With all of this data in one view, they can analyze the complete customer journey, from buying patterns to marketing engagement. With this 360-degree view, REI also puts the customer experience at the center of every business decision\u2014impacting everything from store operations to the e-commerce purchasing experience. At the moment, one focus for the company is evergreen reporting and Tableau dashboards with web functionality are at the core. Evergreen reporting\u2014data delivered on a daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual basis\u2014uses a standard set of customer metrics and helps everyone from executives to managers and subject matter experts implement programs, see their impact on the metrics and make needed changes. \u201cIn the face of the consumer shifts that are happening right now\u2014including the brick and mortar stores to digital and online purchasing\u2014one of the core things at REI is the ability to actually take the data accessible to us, put that into Tableau, discover the insights, and actually have those insights drive our strategy and drive a better customer experience.\u201d Historically, REI analysts spent 80 percent of their time and effort in data preparation and considering how to best convey insights for business consumption and action. With Tableau, that is now a one-time effort and data analysis is so much easier\u2014cutting an average of ten to fifteen hours per week for analysts and data scientists. REI currently has upwards of 1,200 dashboards shared over Tableau Server\u2014bringing scalability and accessibility to its analysts, data scientists and subject matter experts. REI fosters a collaborative culture across the company and this translates to the relationship between IT and business units. REI business analysts curate the data and make it available to subject matter experts, with IT governance and support. Business divisions build the data prototypes and IT develops the foundational, production-grade datasets while the business focuses on developing and delivering actionable Tableau dashboards. As Clinton explains, \u201cIT brings production-grade technology and services, particularly vital investments around reliability, accessibility, scalability, performance and support.\u201d For REI, exploratory analysis in Tableau helps a variety of teams discover the depth and severity of a shift in channel behavior, including the customer segments that are driving growth. To nurture this collaboration, teams commit to these five measures: co-locating to build trust and engage face-to-face; holding a monthly IT and business leadership meeting to communicate more openly; distributing weekly project updates; scheduling a collaborative requirement gathering to better understand needs; and staying true to holding regular one-on-one meetings. \u201cI think Tableau is at the forefront of shaping a culture of analytics at REI,\u201d says Clinton. REI teams are committed to creating a culture of analytics across the company\u2014making an impact all the way up to the C-suite. With Tableau as the critical tool, REI evangelizes and educates its audiences (i.e. the analysts, managers and subject matter experts) on data insights in a few ways. Examples include: lunch and learns, \u201cdata literacy\u201d sessions, one-to-many \u201creporting the news\u201d sessions, and more. REI executives have taken notice of the impact of data analysis, recognizing that enterprise-wide Tableau adoption is vital to keeping a pulse on both strategic initiatives and daily operations. The REI journey to a culture of analytics involved important investments in data preparation and data source curation and delivering insights at the speed of business and the results have been critical to REI\u2019s mission of creating a market-leading customer experience."

        "company": "image",
        "content": "MA Assist, a UK-based property services company, handles insurance claims, home repairs, and maintenance services for property owners. With customer projects totaling more than \u00a330m annually, the company adopted Tableau to streamline operations, track market trends, and improve customer experiences. MA Assist is now 20 percent more operationally efficient than before. Insurance claim durations were also cut by 15 percent, and the company is now targeting a 20 percent year-over-year saving on the cost and duration of insurance claims. Customers are the heart of MA Assist, so it is natural for the company to seek new ways to improve experiences for their customers. One of the areas identified was the customer claims journey, or the amount of time it takes MA Assist to manage an insurance claim \u2013 from the moment the claim is first submitted to when it ultimately closes. Without the right tools, this process can be slow and cumbersome since the parties involved need to share information between each other. \u201cWe knew that better business intelligence tools would provide the data sharing platform our team needed to coordinate claims more efficiently, reducing claims durations for customers and clients,\u201d explains Jorge Gonzalo, Managing Director, MA Assist. \u201cWith Tableau, we can create detailed data visualizations and instantly share them with all parties involved in the claims process, ensuring everyone stays up to speed and greatly reducing administration time on each case. Jorge added, \u201cIn addition to its data sharing capabilities, the insights we can extract using Tableau are much more detailed than anything we were able to achieve before. This allows us to deliver a level of customer service never previously possible, which is reflected in our world class net promoter score of over 70, something we are immensely proud of.\u201d With Tableau, MA Assist can better monitor and report business performance across all major departments including operations, sales and account management teams, as well as throughout its repair network. Connecting all key data sources together through Tableau provided accurate, up-to-date performance reports whenever required, and eliminated delay-to-insights issues. \u201cPrior to Tableau we relied on spreadsheets to collate and report on key business performance,\u201d says Jorge. \u201cWhile sufficient in some areas, the time taken to compile and analyze data led to key insights going unnoticed, or only being spotted too late to be helpful.\u201d \u201cNow we\u2019re able to see in real-time how we are performing, month to date and year to date, using a variety of customizable Tableau visualizations,\u201d Jorge added. By extracting, collating, visualizing and analyzing data taken from all our core management systems, we can immediately see where improvements can be made across all our processes.\u201d Supply chain has significant impact on MA Assist\u2019s revenues. Understanding supply chain capacity in real-time allows MA Assist to identify if any suppliers are having capacity challenges and shift work to other suppliers as required. Not only does this improve efficiency throughout their extensive home repairs network, it also reduces costs for insurance clients who directly benefit from these savings. \u201cTableau gives us complete visibility into every stage of the supply chain, from the initial customer call, to the surveyor visit, estimates gathered, specialist suppliers appointed, repair work completed and customer sign off,\u201d explains Jorge. \u201cFurthermore, we can analyze data by supplier, client and commercial model, allowing us to quickly spot problems and rectify them.\u201d Prior to Tableau, MA Assist had two employees dedicated to the production of management information. Now, these same employees have become highly trained data analysts, specializing in the identification of key trends and issues. They can use Tableau to ask more questions that are relevant, drill down deeper and gain a better understanding of the key trends affecting the UK insurance sector. \u201cThe Association of British Insurance recently noted that escape of water claims are growing in value, with the number of rooms damaged and claimed for increasing over the last three years,\u201d says Jorge. \u201cPreviously we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do much with that information, but with Tableau we can analyze our own databases to see if this trend is reflected in the claims we have processed. If so, we can tailor our offerings and educate our clients accordingly.\u201d Jorge went on to say that when, \u201carmed with better information, we\u2019ve improved efficiency by more than 20 percent across all our processes, reinvesting the time saved directly back into the business. Tableau is a valuable catalyst for change, not only within our organization, but across the whole insurance sector.\u201d"

        "content": "The Charles Schwab Corporation is one of the largest publicly-traded financial services firms based on client assets. At Schwab, data is fundamental to enhancing the customer experience, driving operational leverage, and reducing risk. At the beginning of 2016, Charles Schwab had over 6,000 people using Tableau and was quickly reaching capacity in its Tableau environment. With increasing demand for Tableau licenses across the enterprise, Schwab expanded Tableau to 12,000 employees within 18 months, and now has 16,000 users\u2014all managed by Schwab's IT Center of Excellence. Today, \u201cabout half of the company uses Tableau on a daily basis,\u201d shared Gessica Briggs-Sullivan, Tableau Server Administrator at Schwab. Several departments are already seeing a return on investment. In Schwab's retail branches, branch managers use Tableau to monitor client activity and identify outreach opportunities, resulting in an improved client experience. Schwab creates dedicated dashboards for new initiatives ranging from their robo-advice service to enhanced digital messaging. With increasing transparency from the Center of Excellence and support from an active internal user group, Tableau usage and demand continues to grow. Charles Schwab's Center of Excellence (COE) handles governance and performance for approximately 16,000 Tableau users across the company. The team is dedicated to setting up secure data sources for employees to access\u2014including Teradata, MySQL, Oracle, Splunk, Hadoop, and Excel spreadsheets\u2014so that departments can analyze their own data. In early 2016, Schwab experienced a growing demand for Tableau. At the time, the Center of Excellence didn't have the capacity or the resources in place to handle the surge in data and interest. Employees could wait up to three months to receive a Tableau license. Instead of using legacy BI tools, more employees started accessing data through Tableau. Interest grew organically as more people wanted to create their own dashboards and share information. As a result, Schwab was nearing capacity in its Tableau platform environment. When Gessica Briggs-Sullivan came on board as Charles Schwab's Tableau administrator, she transformed the COE's model to be more transparent, offering Tableau licenses to all departments that wanted to see and understand their data. Under this model, Schwab quickly went from 6,000 Tableau users to 12,000+ within 18 months. \"We changed our course with our increase to 16,000 Tableau users along with a new leadership direction that was heading towards self-service analytics.\" shared Gessica. \"We wanted to change into a more supportive and nurturing environment and the users came with us in this journey.\" \"The exponential growth in Tableau adoption required us to rethink our capacity planning and support model. We developed an approach that supports both the experienced analysts as well as novice business users, advancing our data-driven culture,\" shared Andrew Salesky, Global Data Officer. With this access to visual analytics, Schwab has seen an increase in collaboration and openness. The COE even created a series of dashboards for people to track data about their dashboards, including load times, extract failures, and usage metrics. If an employee witnesses low adoption on one of their dashboards, he or she can consult with the intended audience to ensure that it is still meeting their needs. \"I want to enable users to get this information for their own business needs,\" shared Gessica. \"So we've made efforts to provide this data to dashboard owners.\" To further increase adoption, the team instituted an internal user group, built within a company SharePoint portal. Around 130 employees log into the monthly meetings. Topics range from Tableau tips and dashboard showcases to overviews of Schwab processes. The portal also serves as a community forum where people can ask questions, offer advice, and view recordings of past user groups. \"Users want to see each other succeed,\" said Gessica. \"On the community page, people will ask Tableau questions, and you'll immediately see one of the other more experienced users answering.\" Previously, branch management had fragmented reporting across various business intelligence platforms, leading to inefficiencies in accessing the data. Today with Tableau, branch leadership gain visibility into the whole network to understand regional and branch-level performance metrics and identify areas of opportunity. \"With Tableau, we can align all of our reporting and tie back a branch's contribution to the overall company results, which helps us better understand the impact that they're having,\" shared Jackie Chin, Vice President of Retail Analytics. Branch managers for Schwab's nationwide branch network track progress against key performance indicators like net new assets, advised solutions offerings, transfer of assets, along with net promoter (customer experience) scores with Tableau. Armed with data, managers can coach employees in opportunities for improvement. \"This reporting is changing how they manage their branches,\" said Jackie. \"Branch Managers now have the visibility to really build strategic plans and provide enhanced coaching to help the financial consultants, and ultimately help our clients.\" Within each branch, financial consultants have visibility into flows out to Schwab competitors. The branch can leverage this reporting to identify trends within specific contra-firms, which informs outreach or targeted marketing initiatives. Conversely, the branch can identify clients that bring assets over from a competitor who may have a change in investment needs. Digging deeper into the data, leadership can track advised solutions by region and demographics to ensure product awareness. And if a region's performance is above or below average, they can click in and see what branch is driving that region's performance. Similarly, they could dig in to identify the select clients that are contributing to that performance. Schwab recently rolled out Tableau to 1,200 financial consultants across the United States. This allows the consultants to click through and identify households that would benefit from solutions to improve their overall financial wellbeing\u2014ultimately driving a better, more customized client experience. \"It's an opportunity for the branches to better engage with clients and have more impactful discussions based on their needs, which may include investing new money or getting a financial plan,\" explained Jackie. \"With Tableau, we can identify these clients, reach out to these clients, and provide the help and guidance they need to meet their financial goals\" Schwab's Analytics and Business Insight (ABI) group is the central hub for reporting, supported by more than 100 analysts. The ABI group is tasked with creating automated dashboards for senior leadership and client-facing teams, sourcing data from Schwab's data warehouse. With over 150 terabytes of data in the warehouse, ABI uses Tableau to analyze key performance indicators around investments, new products, and business initiatives. As Schwab launches new products, leadership needed a comprehensive way to monitor business impact across the company. To respond to this need, the ABI group created a managed and automated investing dashboard as an overview for Schwab's top company metrics, including net new accounts along with weekly asset flows and revenue numbers. Without Tableau, this would be a series of massive spreadsheets, which would hinder leadership's ability to make fast, data-driven decisions around business indicators. When Schwab launched Schwab Intelligent Portfolios (SIP) in March 2015\u2014a low-cost automated investment option\u2014the ABI group built a Tableau dashboard to track customer adoption and satisfaction of the product. The dashboard showed this analysis by demographic and customer behaviors, allowing leadership to determine reasons behind customer actions and influence a better customer experience. This dashboard served as a baseline to analyze new products in the future. Similarly, when Schwab started offering a paperless option to customers, the ABI group built a dashboard to analyze the impact on business costs. With this dashboard, leadership can track paperless adoption by product, both on the banking and brokerage sides of the business, along with dollars saved. This helps leadership determine how customers receive these new initiatives to inform future decisions. \"Without Tableau, we would be stuck analyzing enormous amounts of data in spreadsheets,\" said Donald Lay, Senior Business Intelligence Manager. \"Instead, we create dashboards that provide clear actionable insights, and that drive the business forward.\" Read more about Charles Schwab's story on InformationWeek."

        "company": "Crossmedia GmbH",
        "content": "CROSSMEDIA, a communications consulting agency in Germany with three locations and 200 employees, develops concepts for customers from a wide variety of industries with the goal to maximize return on advertising budgets. For Alexander Volk, the Director of Business Intelligence and Technology at CROSSMEDIA, time savings, negotiations, and customer loyalty are of top priority for the business. After deploying Tableau at CROSSMEDIA, teams saved 80% of time in reporting alone. And with the ability to blend and explore data, the CROSSMEDIA team surfaced many critical insights and considerably improved the agency's negotiating position. The agency also creates custom Tableau workbooks for clients and shares them over Tableau Server, which improved customer loyalty and fueled the organization to embrace a more data-driven marketing culture. CROSSMEDIA places online and offline advertising for its customers, and the goal is always to maximize the given budget for each client. Alexander Volk, Director of Business Intelligence and Technology at CROSSMEDIA, explains: \"We are very much concerned with demonstrating the impact of advertising in concrete terms. We ask questions like, has the budget that the customer invested in a certain advertising channel had an effect? Does a TV spot that was broadcast at a certain time of day have an impact on the customer's website traffic? It is always about the advertising impact and reaching the right target groups in the most efficient output of advertising budgets.\" It's mission critical for the agency to be able to optimize campaigns and determine a website visitors' contact chain. In the past, each client advisor was responsible for his or her own report generation and they had to fetch the data from the service providers themselves and then manually process it, mostly within Excel and spreadsheet tools. This time-consuming, manual reporting was significantly slowing the agency's speed to insight, and even worse, was riddled with human error. With some much time being spent on manual reporting, there was no time left for exploratory analysis. After consulting with its partner Woodmark, CROSSMEDIA introduced Tableau to their teams in 2016. Today with Tableau, the team analyzes vast volumes of disparate data from Google AdWords, Google Analytics, Facebook, and delivery systems for display advertising, overlaid with data from YouGov and Nielsen. The agency then shares these dashboards with customers. Thanks to Tableau, CROSSMEDIA realized considerable time savings, allowing more time for data exploration. \"By introducing a central analysis platform with Tableau and by managing all these visualizations on Tableau Server, we have been able to save the consultants 80% of their time. This is time that they no longer have to waste on data preparation and report generation. They can now use their time to analyze the campaigns more intensively, to better recognize the advertising effect, and to get even more out of the advertising money for the customer,\" Volk said. With more time for exploratory analysis, CROSSMEDIA used data blending to visualize a more complete picture from many different sources and channels. By blending data on a common field, CROSSMEDIA was able to assign conversations to the respective triggering publishers, even with multiple ad contacts, which made it possible to further optimize campaigns. The benefit of mixing data from different sources is great in the marketing area,\" Volk said. \"Due to the fact that many different systems, especially in digital marketing, capture the user and the end user at different points in the purchasing decision process, holistic user tracking is very difficult from A to Z,\" Volk said. Data blending paired with visualization allows CROSSMEDIA to find the root causes of advertising campaign inefficiencies. For example, by filtering a dashboard, teams might discover that a digital advertisement performed poorly because it was placed at the bottom of respective website. Finding insights like this strengthens CROSSMEDIA's position with its own customers and according to Volk, allows CROSSMEDIA to \"engage in completely different conversations with advertising marketers.\" Adding a layer of real-time transparency, CROSSMEDIA enables its larger customers to directly access dashboards on Tableau Server, so the company greatly benefits from the added collaboration with its clients. \"[Services for] customers who purchase dashboards and visualization from us can be further personalized. [They] fall in love with it in a certain way. You talk on a completely different level and conduct customer conversations on a completely different basis,\" Volk said. In addition to clients embracing data, CROSSMEDIA also found a significant change in employee attitudes toward analytics and a true adoption of data culture. \"The perception of the data has changed, so that it is no longer a hardship or a hurdle that has to be overcome mentally, but rather something that one can perhaps even look forward to. Because one can quickly and concretely draw conclusions from the visualization, and at the same time take a deep dive into the data, people can go so much deeper into the analysis than was previously possible. Data-driven marketing is becoming much more important to us in the agency, and ultimately also extends through all departments,\" Volk said."

        "content": "Shiseido Japan Company Limited is taking steps to integrate its various data sources\u2014Watashi Plus web services data, POS data, member information, etc.\u2014all on a cloud-based data management platform (DMP). The company aims to use Tableau to analyze these sources of customer behaviour data to engage with customers during valuable \u201ccustomer moments,\u201d using the most appropriate channels, including web advertising, email and LINE campaigns, and strategic web services. Tableau: How are you using Tableau at Shiseido Japan? Goda: We use Tableau mainly for three purposes. First of all, we\u2019re using it to build dashboards to visualize Key Performance Indicators, such as Watashi Plus sales indices. Secondly, we use it to build dashboards for strategy management. We use dashboards for every sales campaign, to see how successful our strategies are and how close we are to reaching our goals. We publish the information on Tableau Server for members to consult as they wish. And third, we use Tableau for ad-hoc analysis. We use Tableau to deploy data on Treasure Data for a deeper analysis. Tableau: Which Tableau functions and features do you find most useful? Goda: Before we installed Tableau, we were using a different reporting tool. But we used it only to send cross-tab reports or for ad-hoc reporting using Excel.\nYoshimoto: I like the fact that we can dig deeper into the data using simple operations, examining it from the perspectives we choose. Before, we mainly used Excel for data analysis, but that took a lot of time. With Tableau\u2019s drag and drop feature, it\u2019s easy to tabulate data, dig deeper into it, and analyze it. Those are great features.\nGoda: When sharing reports, users find they can grasp the information very quickly. Thanks to Tableau visualization, they get a good idea of the results of an analysis much faster than by cross-referencing data. I\u2019m hearing that staff are using Tableau-generated reports more effectively than before we had Tableau.\nYoshimoto: Now it\u2019s easy to conduct analysis with our user base. It was a lot harder using the Business Intelligence tools we had previously. For example, Tableau\u2019s Level of Detail expressions make it easy to tabulate the lifetime values of individual users. Tableau: Tell us about your database environment for Tableau. Goda: For the Tableau environment, we\u2019ve integrated our in-house primary data with third-party data and site access data, all on the Treasure Data DMP. We connect to the DMP via Tableau to perform data analysis. Tableau installation took a little less than two months. We had a data warehouse before installation, so it was simply a matter of publishing the data from there to Tableau Server. That made the transfer to users relatively smooth. After that, it took a little while to get everything in operation, although getting it functional for use was relatively fast.\nYoshimoto: Treasure Data\u2019s DMP and Tableau have excellent compatibility. We enter a query in Treasure Data, and the result that comes out can be output as is to a Tableau Datasource file. We like the fact that we can tabulate data using Treasure Data and then visualize the results with Tableau, with no hassle at all. Tableau: What improvements did you see after Tableau Server made it possible to share dashboards and reports within your company? Yoshimoto: Well, one improvement is that Tableau has boosted our productivity. Before Tableau, we had to depend on an external partner simply to create a report. We had to set a fee for each report created, and all that was quite time consuming as well. But now, with Tableau, in-house analysts have no trouble creating reports. Then we publish the reports on Tableau Server for sharing. Before Tableau, it took about a week just to make simple changes to a report. Now with Tableau, we can edit a report in a few seconds and then upload it to Tableau Server in another few seconds for everyone to share.\nGoda: Since we installed Tableau, I think the biggest improvement is that users can now handle reports more or less as they want. Before, only people handling the data could see it. But now, with Tableau dashboards and worksheets, many people, including staff handling the brand side of things and EC staff, can share data at the same time and in the same format. In addition, we can send data either as deep or narrow data, at both levels. These are all big improvements. Tableau: What is your next step for using Tableau? Yoshimoto: At the present time, we only use Tableau in the EC Business Promotion Department, which handles our Watashi Plus web services. But in the future we hope to extend Tableau installation across other departments. For example, we want our brand teams to have a Tableau environment to work in."

Where are we right now? Are we on time? Is the product line as we deliver it the right one? Do we have to change anything? Can I still get a bonus?\" The good success of the Tableau projects has led to an unexpectedly high growth rate at OAC. Thomas Se\u00dfner reports, \"because we really solve problems and don't just put systems on top of them, we've gained a much improved standing\". The visualizations and analyses created by OAC are made available to customers through Tableau Server. Particularly useful in customer projects is the ability to consolidate data sources from Excel spreadsheets, ERP solutions, andvarious web data sources such as weather information. \"When mixing and integrating the data, the main benefit for the customer is that it saves a tremendous amount of time because he does not have to re-enter everything over and over again. This also means fewer errors\". In customer surveys, OAC has found time savings of up to 90%. OAC customers also experience the benefits of Tableau, Thomas Se\u00dfner explains, \"For example, our main customer has saved over 180 Excel spreadsheets.\" The time saved in data preparation and controlling could be used by the predominantly small and medium-sized companies for other tasks: \"One of our customers has taken six employees out of the controlling department,\" reports Thomas Se\u00dfner. \"They then went into sales and thus significantly increased revenue.\" However, the attitudes of customers towards data have also changed significantly overall. \"Employees work with data much more,\" explains Thomas Se\u00dfner. \"Because comparing, entering or retrieving data has become so easy that it's fun. Today, with just a few clicks we can do things that used to take an hour or two.\" OAC benefits from Tableau's flexibility in case of changes in customer solutions or new projects. Thomas Se\u00dfner says: \"We want to go with the company, we want to find solutions for the company, even if it changes. And with Tableau, a change can be displayed very quickly and immediately visualized.\" In the near future, OAC will make greater use of Tableau's alarm functions for its customer projects. \"We want to introduce the early warning system by e-mail,\" explains Thomas Se\u00dfner. \"If something goes wrong, employees should be informed automatically by e-mail. Or if, for example, it is clear from the weather data that there will soon be a lot of snow, all available employees for the winter road clearance service should be automatically assigned and also receive a message via WhatsApp.\" Thomas Se\u00dfner believes that with Tableau, the company is well-positioned for the future: \"I find the way in which problems are approached phenomenal. And I think that's the future, too. If I look at what Tableau can do now, I look forward to the next few years.\""

        "company": "Capgemini",
        "content": "Capgemini is a consulting and IT services company with 190,000+ employees in over 40 countries. Analyzing social media and website data with Excel and PowerPoint was time-consuming and it wasn't yielding results to better understand its regional customer base. The company also needed a better way to publish findings from studies and sought a more visual, interactive form for improved analysis and consumption. Capgemini uses Tableau in the DACH region and as a result, reduced the time and cost of ongoing web analytics by 80 percent and gained knowledge about site visitors. What took days to learn before is knowledge gained in a fraction of the time. The firm's marketing and communications department are reacting on-the-fly to questions and drilling deeper into data results from multiple sources. With Tableau Public, Capgemini is also making its studies more attractive and engaging to better differentiate itself in the consultancy field. The consulting and IT service provider closely monitors activities on its country websites and social media channels to keep abreast of the interests and needs of visitors and to quickly uncover fresh trends, so it can tailor offers accordingly. With substantial amounts of data coming from sources such as Google Analytics, Facebook or Twitter, the team's conventional tools (Excel and PowerPoint) were pushed to their limits, not delivering the immediate insights that grew more critical for Capgemini as a global operation. The team saw the benefits of visual analysis and decided to switch to Tableau in 2015. The consultancy started by implementing Tableau Desktop in the marketing and communications department and relied on Tableau Reader to distribute the dashboard results. After a brief time, the company acquired Tableau Server licenses for power users looking to work and interact with data daily. Today through Tableau Server, users blend data from Google Analytics and social channels to track daily updates. For the marketing department it has been revealing to see how users arrive at the website. For example, they can determine if customers landed on the website through clicks on social channels or e-mail marketing and then dig deeper into specific activities performed. Also, Capgemini's blog owners have drilled into how often certain blog posts are read or what topics resonate most, which informs the editorial planning and strategy. And the HR department tracks which job postings are particularly appealing to applicants. Georg Ogulin, Digital Marketing Manager DACH Region at Capgemini, explains: \"With Tableau, you get completely different possibilities to display data and insights. Then, there is the speed in which you get them. The introduction of Tableau in our department has made it much faster to arrive at findings that in the past took us days.\" Today, with a deeper view into its data, Capgemini is taking appropriate measures to optimize the content and navigation of the website, adapting blog posts to current interests, trimming job advertisements to the highest response rates and making business-relevant content more discoverable. Capgemini conducts studies and online surveys with IT decision makers that are published regularly. While the amount of data isn't massive, there is complexity to it with different filtering options across responses or multiple combinations of data. Then, there is communication of the results, which used to take more than 1,000 PowerPoint slides - a massive effort and time requirement for their analysts. Today, Capgemini uses Tableau Public with great success for their research studies, experiencing time savings with publishing and data compilation. This process can be applied to other areas of the business such as website management or social channel maintenance. Tableau Public also delivers other advantages, giving interested parties an opportunity to explore the study results interactively and drill into areas of greatest interest to them. This has helped extend the reach and engagement for Capgemini's studies and is helping set the firm apart from some of its competitors. \"We save a lot of time in producing our analyses and results,\" explains Georg Ogulin. \"And what is particularly fascinating about Tableau is that you can actually go deeper and deeper into the results step-by-step.\" By also delivering an improved experience when publishing studies, Capgemini has gained a better understanding of what findings and subjects create the most interest. This helps the company realign their business strategies with audience interest in mind and be more successful in day-to-day business. Capgemini also uses Tableau in customer projects, including mapping exercises and business analyses like supply chain optimization. Capgemini has utilized Tableau across all types of organizations from logistics companies to automotive and consumer goods manufacturers. Capgemini develops the dashboards centrally and then internal customers can use the data in principle, along with the marketing department."

Founded in Istanbul in 2016, it offers a wide range of award winning international and Turkish content and original programming to its audience. The company uses Tableau to provide key data insights into business-critical areas including viewer habits, customer conversion rates (from free trial to paid subscription) and popular content on the platform. This information allows BluTV to deliver an optimized viewing experience for every customer and make informed decisions on future content commissioning. As a heavily data-driven business, BluTV's leadership team knew very early that spreadsheet-based analysis simply wouldn't be good enough for their needs. \"We use data in nearly every aspect of our business operations,\" says Ezgi Cetiner, a key user of business intelligence at BluTV. \"Fast, accurate analysis is critical in helping us understand our viewers and their behavior. It's what our business is built on, so we need tools that allow us to do that.\" Before Tableau, the company relied on Google Analytics and Excel-based reports to identify and understand key business trends. However, the cumbersome, manual nature of the process restricted reporting to just once per week, or once per month in some instances, which didn't allow for meaningful insight in such a fast-paced industry. \"A significant amount of our team's time was going on creating various operational reports which were not only time consuming to produce but difficult to interpret accurately,\" says Uygar K\u00f6se, data engineer at BluTV. \"As a result, data was often outdated by the time the team saw it and the chance of learning anything from it was lost.\" With Tableau in place, BluTV has fast, actionable insights into all key business areas including popular content, CRM, marketing campaigns and financials. \"With Tableau, we can connect information from various sources including HIVE/HADOOP, Google Analytics, and Amazon Redshift in one central location, allowing for much more comprehensive analysis than ever before,\" says H\u00fcseyin Yurtseven, Chief Technology Officer of BluTV. \"The data is available at all times, meaning reports and analysis can be pulled whenever required, without the need to manually compile it in spreadsheets.\" As a result of moving to Tableau, a number of problematic data siloes have also been broken down within the company. \"All key data is now available as interactive visualizations in Tableau, so there's never any need to go chasing for locally stored data anymore,\" explains Ezgi Cetiner. \"Its ease of use also means people without any IT experience can start gaining valuable insights from the data immediately.\" BluTV offers all viewers a free seven-day trial of its service before asking them to convert to a paid subscriber. Securing these conversions is a key aspect of the company's business model, which makes understanding customer behavior particularly important in this area. \"Tableau gives us fantastic insight into the factors driving conversions to our paid service,\" explains Ezgi. \"Using data captured through Google Analytics and our own databases and visualized in Tableau, we can quickly pinpoint how and when people are choosing to become paid subscribers and identify what content they've been watching prior to their decision.\" Using this information, BluTV can shape effective marketing campaigns, offer timely incentives, and deliver new content at optimum moments during the week or year to boost subscriptions. \"The ability to monitor subscription data in Tableau gives us a near real-time window into our customers' mind-set and behavior,\" says Alptug Copuroglu, CFO and Head of Business Development at BluTV. \"This means we can react quickly to changes in customer behavior and adapt content and marketing efforts accordingly.\" Conversely, Tableau has also given BluTV greater insight into subscription cancellations and the reasons behind them. \"When people choose to leave our service, it's extremely valuable to understand their reasons behind it,\" says Onur Polat, Customer Value Manager at BluTV. \"Whether it's lack of support for a particular device, cancellation of a favorite show, price changes or something else entirely, Tableau lets us visualize all of this data in one place and quickly identify major drivers behind customer churn.\" An area of significant interest to BluTV is watching behavior of its customers. Tableau enabled BluTV to combine watching data with subscriber data and to pinpoint the shows that are really hooking people in. This data-driven approach to content analysis means BluTV can quickly identify fan favorites and the shows delivering the biggest return on investment. These insights can then be used to guide the future direction of content productions and acquisitions and inform decisions regarding the re-commissioning of shows for additional seasons. The company also uses Tableau data insights when scheduling content on its service. \"Tableau allowed us to drill deep into viewing habits, revealing a number of interesting patterns,\" says Ezgi Cetiner. \"While the majority of viewers watch a fairly wide variety of content during the week, many of them focus on original content at the weekends, when they have more time to 'binge watch' multiple episodes at a time.\" As a result, BluTV ensures the majority of its most popular shows premiere just before the weekend, when viewers are most receptive to it. \"Viewing habits have change continuously,\" concludes Alptug Copuroglu. \"People want much more control over where and when they watch their favorite shows. Using data to create a content plan that closely matches the habits of our viewers increases customer satisfaction and customer lifetime on our platform.\""

The company supplies mobile and landline services\u2014including telephony, data, and value-added services\u2014to roughly 52.9 million households and business customers. Supported by Tableau technology, Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland ensures a comprehensive depiction of all their processes. This allows employees to quickly see and react to challenges. For example, when the network technology team spots recurring error patterns using Tableau, they can fix the problem before it affects customers. This self-service approach appeals to many employees throughout the company and roughly 500 were actively using Tableau only a few weeks after it was first deployed. J\u00fcrgen Herr, Manager Analytical Processes and Monitoring at Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland shares how analyzing data in Tableau allows Telef\u00f3nica to identify market opportunities ahead of the competition. The German telecommunications market is highly competitive and driven by constant innovation. Companies that fail to react immediately to network issues, current technology trends, or changing customer expectations lose market share quickly. Although Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland had solid processes, the Business Analytics & Artificial Intelligence unit struggled to keep up with the varied and numerous demands from employees across departmental functions, including controlling, network technology, sales, and marketing. \"Market and technology in our sector are evolving rapidly, and traditional reporting can\u2019t keep up with the demands of our employees and departments,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Herr, Manager Analytical Processes and Monitoring. \u201cOur Business Analytics & Artificial Intelligence unit was working at full capacity just creating all the additional reports and analyses necessary for day-to-day decision making.\" Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland decided in 2016 to democratize company data and empower employees with self-service analytics and reporting that provide important insights for their work. With Tableau Server, Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland provides its employees with a business intelligence platform that allows them to use data from the past to understand the present and make better decisions for the future. \"We created a platform that is open to all employees on the intranet,\" says J\u00fcrgen Herr. \"There, we provide certain information and analyses to everyone. Then there are numerous private sites run by the individual departments where only they have access and analyze their own specific questions and data volumes.\" To grow adoption, the Business Analytics & Artificial Intelligence unit regularly hosts internal webinars and requests feedback from employees to understand their needs better. The self-service approach has already paid off for Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland. \"The Tableau platform helps us make well-founded decisions based on accurate and current data,\" says J\u00fcrgen Herr. \"For companies competing in this most dynamic telecommunications market, that\u2019s practically essential for survival.\" For instance, the networking technology team recently spotted repeating error patterns by analyzing error messages and server logs. This allowed the company to identify and fix the root causes before they affected customers. The new freedom in quickly answering questions with self-service analytics is especially welcome in the departments\u2019 day-to-day business. J\u00fcrgen Herr explains how self-service has \"removed bottlenecks.\" Before, teams were reliant on the business intelligence team for each new question that popped up. Today with Tableau, employees have an enterprise-ready, governed platform for analysis\u2014and the Business Intelligence & Artificial Intelligence unit has more time to focus on strategic initiatives. Looking forward, Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland plans to significantly increase the number of Tableau users: \"We want to run more analyses on Tableau going forward,\" says J\u00fcrgen Herr. \"There are many interesting new projects in the pipeline as well. Among them, the automated monitoring of standard processes for server loads, network loads or error messages. Certain threshold values trigger automatic alerts, backed up by Tableau dashboards that allow interactive drill-downs into the root causes.\" J\u00fcrgen Herr summarizes: \"We are very happy with our new Tableau solution. We expect to gain a lot of interesting results and impactful business insights from analyzing our data\u2014and we are very much looking forward to that.\""

The online dry-cleaning service Jonny Fresh, headquartered in Berlin, offers private and business customers from Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hanover and Vienna extensive laundry services. Whether you need shirts, suits, a lab coat or a wedding dress cleaned, or your business requires towel service or laundry for employees, Jonny Fresh has you covered. Customers place their orders and request pick-up and delivery deadlines via the Jonny Fresh website, by phone or via smartphone app. Jonny Fresh takes care of the rest. The company cooperates with an efficient cleaning partner in each city, draws up optimized tour and time schedules for the collection and delivery vehicles and takes care of the entire logistical and commercial handling. After a stormy start-up phase since its foundation in 2013, Jonny Fresh decided in March 2017 to completely refresh its IT architecture, moving away from static Excel spreadsheets for the bulk of business analysis. \"All analyses of current profitability, customer and business development were useless from one day to the next,\" recalls Stefan Michaelis, founder and CEO of Jonny Fresh. \"We had to move away from this process.\" After a detailed market analysis, Jonny Fresh decided to test Tableau. \"Evaluations based on maps are particularly important for us,\" explains Stefan Michaelis. \u201cFor the calculation and assessment of collection and delivery times and associated costs, which have a strong impact on the profitability of each individual order, and for the creation of route plans for delivery vehicles that are optimized in terms of time and cost, we absolutely need the geo-mapping function. And this is where one of Tableau's particular strengths was revealed.\" As the company has limited IT capacity, Jonny Fresh worked with Tableau partner, Woodmark for support. \"We have clearly defined our ideas and the extremely short time horizon for a test case,\" says Stefan Michaelis. \u201cWhen we finally tried the dashboards presented by Woodmark, we were completely convinced. After two days of implementation, we had the Tableau Cloud solution live in our company.\" Today, Jonny Fresh uses Tableau for a variety of applications and continues to develop new analyses. The largest project is still the logistics sector. With Tableau, logistics teams use detailed maps to divide regions of individual post codes into several quadrants, enabling the company to expand sales and remain profitable. They can also compare regions to understand differing challenges, capacities, and customer structures dependent on location. Teams can also analyze the data in many ways\u2014filtering by orders, number of new customers, day of week, or sales volume in a certain period of time. This allows Jonny Fresh to determine new opportunities to better understand its customer structure, optimize costs, and expand the business through targeted measures. Sales, customer support and marketing departments also use Tableau for day-to-day business analyses. For example, Isabel Zani, Marketing Manager at Jonny Fresh, uses Tableau to investigate responses from a large voucher card campaign. Jonny Fresh delivers \u20ac15 vouchers, by post, by hand on the street, and directly in offices in key sectors such as consulting and finance in all active cities. \"All coupon codes, including city, distribution method and distribution date, are stored in an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed in Tableau.\" When a voucher is redeemed, Jonny Fresh\u2019s marketing team uses Tableau to determine which campaign the voucher belongs to, which distribution method works best in each region, how long such vouchers are typically kept, and to determine how they affected start and follow-on sales. Isabel Zani said, \"We use the knowledge we have gained to continuously optimize this marketing measure.\" In addition, Jonny Fresh continuously evaluates online activities on its website and social media channels. With Tableau, the marketing team connects to data sources like Google Analytics, AdWords, and social media data along with internal databases with customer and order data. \u201cOf course, we are interested in where the users come from, what they are particularly interested in with us, and how long they will stay with us,\" explains Isabel Zani. \u201cThanks to Tableau, we can quickly get to the bottom of all interesting questions. This enables us to constantly gain new insights into our business and, despite the enormous amounts of data, to keep track of things.\""

        "company": "CyberSecurity Malaysia ",
        "content": "CyberSecurity Malaysia is a national cyber security specialist and technical agency under the Malaysia\u2019s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. The agency tracks and responds to cyber-threats to prevent disruptions to the critical information infrastructures. With Tableau, the analyst team can profile threat actors, forecasting and minimizing future attacks. And with mobile dashboards, the executives can track industry trends on the go. As a result of improved analytics processes, the agency helps Malaysian law enforcement agencies formulate new policies around cyberattacks within the country. CyberSecurity Malaysia provides cybersecurity services to help prevent and minimize disruptions to critical information infrastructures to protect the public, the economy, and government services. With over 70 different threat feeds and online news sources, fast insights are crucial to threat response. Prior to Tableau, CyberSecurity Malaysia\u2019s analyst team relied on development efforts to display data to the rest of business in a digestible format. To create an agile analytics program, the team adopted Tableau. Today they can slice, filter, and aggregate data within a few clicks. The team collects data sets from various threat feed sources, which are then stored in a Hadoop data lake. They then bring this data into Tableau for analysis. \u201cTableau makes it faster and easier to identify patterns that give us the ability to resolve data quality problems instantly,\u201d said Dato' Dr. Haji Amirudin bin Abdul Wahab, CEO of CyberSecurity Malaysia. \u201cWe can also blend various data easily.\u201d Today, the team updates existing dashboards instead of building a new view for every request, leading to massive time savings. For example, developing the cyber-attack landscape dashboard now takes a matter of hours compared to the days it would take using D3.js. \u201cWe are so grateful that we take less time to revise our dashboards if we need to add new data sets. Without Tableau, we would probably need several days to make changes,\u201c added Dato' Dr. Amirudin. The analyst team optimized these dashboards for mobile devices, allowing stakeholders to track recent data surrounding the cyber-threat landscape on the go\u2014including industry trends. At the industry level, trend dashboards provide a general view of industry verticals that need to be addressed in order to formulate new defensive strategies. \u201cIt is really a paradigm shift for us from a simple report to insightful reporting,\u201d said Dato' Dr. Amirudin. Other mobile dashboards show data around cyber-attacks over a certain time period, categorized by common vulnerabilities. With Tableau, CyberSecurity Malaysia can analyze open and closed threat feeds to identify relationships between threat actors, cyber-attacks, and certain industries. For example, CyberSecurity Malaysia analysts can differentiate cyber-attack patterns against various industry verticals, enabling them to profile specific threat actors and identify their preferred hacking methods. Tableau also allows them to find relationships between critical vulnerabilities against end-user devices. In addition to cyber-attacks, the analyst team recently started to analyze cybercrimes, scanning for scams and fraudulent websites that target Malaysian internet users. This analysis is then circulated amongst security advisors for respective security administrators\u2014particularly those in the critical sectors. \u201cTableau has simplified our tasks. We are no longer spending time developing charts and graphs; we can just concentrate on our security data. It now takes a matter of hours or days, not weeks or months,\u201d explained Dato' Dr. Amirudin. They can profile specific threat actors to understand typical hacking methods. They can also find relationships between critical vulnerabilities and end-user devices\u2014helping forecast and prevent potential attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s an enjoyable moment when encountering another insight that we have never seen before.\u201d Due to improved data quality and reporting processes, CyberSecurity Malaysia can also assist the Malaysian law enforcement agencies in formulating new policies around cyber-attacks in the country. \u201cWe are improving our advisory services to the Government through better reporting with Tableau. It is a life changing experience and it is really fun,\u201d added Dato' Dr. Amirudin. Moving forward, more employees at CyberSecurity Malaysia are requesting Tableau. For example, the cybercrime division began using Tableau to analyze cases related to fraudulent websites. CyberSecurity Malaysia will continue to collaborate in education program through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Tableau in order to create awareness of visual analytics for analysts and researchers. \"Since we started collaborating with Tableau, CyberSecurity Malaysia researchers have emerged as third runner up in a local data Hackathon competition after just one-month of guidance from a Tableau technical expert. \u201cWe view Tableau as a practical tool to unleash our potential to visualize our data with impact.\u201d"

        "company": "HelloFresh",
        "content": "HelloFresh supplies fresh food and recipes directly to consumer households in ten international markets. Everything needed for the weekly meals is meticulously organized for each subscriber, sourced locally and delivered to the doorstep at the desired time. Based on a subscription model with any-time cancellation, HelloFresh uses subscribers' weekly orders to manage supply chains and demand in a consistent manner and to enhance the customer experience. HelloFresh deployed the Tableau platform to centralize global performance reporting, saving 10-20 man hours per day and providing regional sales and marketing teams with real-time data for nimble decision making. As a result, the HelloFresh marketing team can react to trends in customer behavior and optimize marketing campaigns on-the-fly, leading to better conversion rates and improved customer loyalty. HelloFresh regularly carries out online marketing campaigns in all regional markets\u2014including text or banner advertising on various publisher websites\u2014to convey its messages and attract new customers to its website. The marketing team also analyzes click behavior from both prospects and existing customers on the HelloFresh website to identify opportunities to improve conversion rates. In the past, teams analyzed data in Excel, bringing in data from Google Analytics and various MySQL production databases. Due to the agile nature of the HelloFresh marketing team, this data had to be consistently downloaded, aggregated, and analyzed to yield up-to-date results. The daily production of daily and weekly performance reports required between one and four hours of manual work for each of HelloFresh\u2019s ten regions\u2014and the process often did not provide the desired insights. Karl Villanueva, Head of Search Engine Advertising and Display at HelloFresh shared, \"The speed of digital marketing is so great that we always have to make decisions in real time. We can't wait a quarter of a year, we can't wait six months or a whole year. We have to make decisions based on what happened yesterday or last week.\" When Karl Villanueva joined HelloFresh, one of his first tasks was to centralize global reporting for all ten regions in the Berlin branch, starting by introducing Tableau on a company-wide scale. Today, all of HelloFresh\u2019s data sources go through ETL processes into a data warehouse, running on Hadoop. The team then connects directly to the data warehouse to analyze data in Tableau. Karl\u2019s team developed a set of key performance indicator (KPI) dashboards that show click rates, bounce rates, and conversion rates, along with sales and retention metrics. They set up automatic refreshes and subscriptions in Tableau Server so that stakeholders receive daily updates every morning across all ten regions. \u201cWe are very democratic with our data at HelloFresh, because we do not want to store them in silos,\u201d says Karl. \u201cIf there's any marketing data that might be of interest to other teams, we're happy to share it with them.\" Previously, analyzing customer data primarily in Excel made it virtually impossible to map the lifetime customer journey across different channels and platforms. Karl explained, \"With the increasing proliferation of cross-channel marketing and cross-device marketing with the associated assignment difficulties, we absolutely need an aggregated source to assess performance from a superior perspective and not separately, not in data silos.\" The ability to consolidate data sources into Tableau dashboards allows the HelloFresh marketing team to discover interesting behavior patterns from both prospects and existing customers across various channels and devices: \u201cFor example, lets say someone discovered the product in a feature article on our blog and later learned more about the product, but perhaps wanted to think about it some more. Maybe he/she planned a trip this week and because of that, decided to make a purchase in the following week,\u201d says Karl. \u201cIn this case, it is important for a marketing team to recognize the correlation between the ad seen today and the purchase decision\u2014perhaps a few days later or even further in the future.\" As a results of faster analysis, the marketing team analyzed click behavior on the website and retention periods across pages to determine three typical customer personas: the customer looking to try new recipes, the customer who wants fresh ingredients, but has trouble getting to the grocery store, and the customer interested in special ingredients that are often difficult to obtain locally. With these insights, the HelloFresh marketing team can segment target groups and present them with relevant advertising and landing pages. This also affects how content is presented on the HelloFresh website. \"Marketing should not be a pain, but should be relevant. Our marketing should not distract the customer, but rather provide them with answers to their individual questions,\" explains Karl Villanueva. \u201cIf we know that they are interested in certain ingredients, we will present them with the right recipes. If we suspect, based on their history, that they would like to buy something from us, we present the shop pages.\" This approach leads to a positive customer experience and as a result, increased conversion rates and higher customer loyalty. With automated dashboard updates, regional marketing managers can understand overall campaign and sales performances across different territories. Leadership can also compare weekly metrics across regions to benchmark success. With current data, the team can be nimble and adjust campaigns as necessary. For example, if a team discovers that a digital advertisement isn\u2019t delivering the desired results, they can take action to adjust the creative or messaging to ensure an optimal return on investment for the campaign. Karl Villanueva explains, \"Tableau dashboards save us so much time in our daily work. We have found that it has made our lives much easier because we receive important information immediately and are able to react faster.\" When asked what advice he would give newcomers to performance marketing, Karl shared, \"Marketing is increasingly influenced by data. It is more competitive and is based more on facts and figures than ever before. Today you will get much more insight. Moreover, in order to quantify the figures properly, you must be able to analyze them sensibly. And Tableau is definitely a big help for that.\""

Its 55,000 employees in 120 countries empower results for clients by delivering business insights that reduce volatility and improve performance. With Tableau, Aon has significantly improved its data analysis capabilities and enabled employees to collaborate more effectively on a day-to-day basis. With Tableau, important insights can be identified in minutes rather than months, resulting in a significant improvement in speed to value across the company. Aon relies on fast, effective analysis to deliver the right insights to its customers. But with growing quantities of information coming in daily, making sense of it all requires more than spreadsheets and bar graphs. \u201cThe quality of data we receive via some of our more traditional channels is not always what we\u2019d like it to be,\u201d explains Eddie Short, Managing Director of People Analytics at Aon. \u201cEffectively blending the different types of data is also extremely challenging without the right tools.\u201d With Tableau, Eddie and his team can analyze all types of structured and unstructured data through one platform. Not only does this improve overall business intelligence by centralizing all incoming data in one location, but Tableau helps drive better collaboration throughout the business by bringing data to life in ways that spreadsheets could not. Aon often collects survey data for clients. For example, Eddie shares the example of Aon\u2019s recent work with compensation surveys, analysing salaries to determine the standard of fair pay based on demographic information. With Tableau, Aon consultants can effectively communicate these baselines to clients to consider a variety of factors and spot pay gaps. With this actionable information, clients can quickly take action to close pay gaps within their companies. \u201cI think in terms of data, bringing it to life and telling stories with it is fundamental, and that\u2019s exactly what Tableau does,\u201d says Eddie. Aon consultants are seeing results. Clients often comment on the improved analysis quality and the more intuitive data exploration. The ability to present data in new and exciting ways both internally and to clients has helped Eddie and his team to align their operations against Aon\u2019s main business strategy. \u201cMaximizing the value of data for our clients is a key component of our overall business strategy,\u201d says Eddie. \u201cTableau is a great enabler of this, putting the capability to blend data and tell real stories into the hands of everyone.\u201d The ability to deliver fast analysis and insight has significant benefits for Aon\u2019s customers around the world. Using Tableau, Aon has cut lead times on its annual survey analysis from several months to just hours, or even minutes. This improvement has helped to accelerate the company\u2019s revenue collection cycle and deliver a 20% improvement in terms of speed to value. Eddie attributes much of this improved performance to Tableau\u2019s visual functionality, making trend analysis much more efficient compared with manually trawling through spreadsheets. \u201cIt's visual in terms of the great presentation, but also in terms of preparation of data,\u201d explains Eddie. \u201cIt means we can interact with the data however we need to and uncover insights much faster than we could before. The level of visualization Tableau offers is just unparalleled in the marketplace.\u201d Internally, Aon is using Tableau to bring its own data together in ways never previously possible. \u201cFor a long time we've been the classic management by spreadsheet kind of organization,\u201d explains Eddie. \u201cNow we're starting to use Tableau to explain to our own people how the business is operating, and we\u2019re doing it in a much more visual and easily understandable way.\u201d After seeing what Tableau is capable of, multiple divisions within Aon have also made it a core component of their operations, resulting in a significant upsurge in internal usage. \u201cWe've now got considerable demand across the business, from teams that want to bring more of their data together and use it with their clients,\u201d says Eddie. \u201cThey're seeing the benefits of Tableau in terms of analytical power, but also visualization and storytelling power.\u201d Realizing the significant potential of Tableau beyond the company\u2019s own four walls, Aon has also started using it to deliver greater insight directly to customers via its web portals. \u201cWe want to put more data and more tools in the hands of our people, but also the hands of our customers,\u201d says Eddie. \u201cSo now we\u2019re using Tableau to deliver more insight in packaged applications directly to customers.\u201d \u201cMany of our clients and customers have already commented on the improved quality of data analysis they are seeing, how it's easier to quantify the value that we deliver,\u201d concludes Eddie. \u201cAs a result, we are getting a compounding benefit across the whole organisations. That's the key success of Tableau for us.\u201d"

Before Tableau, employees across Eastern Alliance often repeated daily, monthly, and quarterly analysis works and only few people had access to these reports and rely heavily on IT to prepare the data. Today, more than 25 analysts across management and the sales and operations teams access Tableau Desktop and Server on hourly basis to analyse sales, products trends, market sentiment, and profit in addition to forecasting stocks level and procurement. With Tableau, the EA analyst team no longer has to refresh, extract, or manually blend multiple data sources to monitor real-time sales performance and key performance indicators (KPIs) for thousands of transactions. All managers across the whole organisation can now track KPIs and make quick adjustments whenever necessary. Overall, Eastern Alliance Trading experienced increased productivity and empowered managers to make decisions based on data. Eastern Alliance Trading Sdn Bhd is a distributor company that has more than 1000 daily transactions, which translates to about 300,000 transactions in a year. The company stores sales data in Microsoft SQL Server, uses a Syntrino Distributor Management System, CRM and Sales League to manage sales transactions, and blends accounting data from SAP Business One. Since the company acts as a distributor for FMCG and Telco product, it processes supply chain data for thousands of consumer goods. Eastern Alliance adopted Tableau to enable all employees to analyse and understand their data. Today more than 25 analysts across management and the sales and operations team access the Tableau platform to gather insights. Instead of creating repetitive reports, employees can focus on market intelligence and future planning that drive the business forward. Previously Eastern Alliance needed to extract data from Excel files and multiple systems to see current sales numbers or maintain the correct inventories numbers. With Tableau, managers can spot sales trends and monitor sales performance for each consumer brands in real time. With Tableau Mobile, Eastern Alliance Trading\u2019s head of sales and warehouse manager can now check sales numbers on a mobile device for analysis on the go. Collections and bank reconciliation is now easier since branch administrators can access their daily aging and collection reports through Tableau Server instead of a static PDF or Excel file. Printing of reports is totally eliminated, no more cumbersome papers. Tableau has also improved data management and helps to save time. New Tableau users continue to provide positive feedback and regularly access Tableau Server on a daily basis\u2014increasing productivity."

DoIT&C, as per the vision of the Hon\u2019ble Chief Minister, decided to adopt the Tableau platform to replace the traditional MIS-based systems for more effective decision making. With Tableau, the organization can analyze both structured and unstructured data from a central data lake, a central data warehouse in Rajasthan State Data Center which acts as an aggregation point for various data sources and bring it to one place and is also optimized for operational analytics. Today, DoIT&C reduced its report delivery period from weeks to hours. Before Tableau, the organization manually aggregated vast amounts of data from critical applications consisting of over 65 million rows that translate to about 1.5 TB. Using traditional methods for various departmental web applications was very time consuming. Also, the team was not aware of the quality & consistency of data that was stored or how the relationships between the data were established at the back-end. In some cases, it was difficult to identify and diagnose data-related issues when they arose. Additionally, adapting to the daily change requirements for reporting was also a challenge. To overcome cited issues and challenges, the department had to request a copy of the data from the state data centre for troubleshooting since the state data center policy prevented them from having access to the production database data. After receiving the copy, the team had to load it to the local system database and find any existing issues in the process, which consumed a lot of time. Tableau helped the department address cited issues and challenges and the team can quickly analyse the data and deliver reports to departments and tailor dashboards to individual requirements. Since reports are accurate and standardized, the team can also respond to change requests from various stakeholders within a few minutes. Overall, DoIT&C reduced its report delivery period from weeks to hours. The department developed a Chief Minister\u2019s dashboard application for the Hon\u2019ble Chief Minister of Govt. of Rajasthan, providing a unified, interactive, and analytical interface that helps her and other officers monitor and analyse the progress of various key projects, schemes, and departments across the state. The dashboard also helps her accurately and quickly identify relationships between various data sources. The Govt. of Rajasthan shared how Tableau\u2019s flexibility increases productivity across the organization: \u201cBeing a cross-platform product, we have the flexibility to use Tableau on both Windows and Mac platforms, while other products sometimes lack this ability.\u201d As a result of the team\u2019s work with Tableau, the Chief Minister\u2019s dashboard application has recently been awarded the SKOCH Smart Governance Award 2017 in both GOLD and MERIT categories. Also, the application is recently shortlisted for the Computer Society of India (CSI) Nihilent eGovernance Awards 2017."

With Tableau, PulsePoint transformed its client analytics engine, moving from 20-slide PowerPoint presentations to interactive, actionable dashboards delivered over Tableau Cloud. Partnering with Alight Analytics, PulsePoint uses ChannelMix\u2014Alight\u2019s data aggregation platform for marketers\u2014to bring data from sentiment tracking tools, IQ Media and Brandwatch into Tableau for analysis. With a few clicks, clients can monitor brand sentiment in real time and understand the root causes of changes\u2014a vast improvement from yearly brand studies. Several Fortune 500 companies use these dashboards to respond to market changes and manage communication crises, providing a competitive advantage across various industries. PulsePoint Group helps clients harness the vast digital landscape to understand brand reputation across channels, influencing marketing strategy for billion-dollar companies. PulsePoint consultants use social media monitoring tool Brandwatch and media measurement tool IQ Media to attribute sentiment, key messages, and other variables that influence public sentiment. PulsePoint purchased the Tableau platform, including Desktop and Online, to empower clients to dig into their own data. Partnering with Alight Analytics, the creator of the ChannelMix data aggregation platform for marketers, PulsePoint can bring data from sources like Brandwatch and IQ Media directly into Tableau for analysis. And data infrastructure setup is included in the ChannelMix platform, so PulsePoint consultants dive into the data right away. Today, PulsePoint\u2019s clients can access Tableau dashboards on a daily basis to understand how their reputation is performing in real time. They can also look back on data from previous months or forecast future occurrences. \u201cIf they say, \u2018I want to understand what happened in January,\u2019 they can just change the filter on the Tableau dashboard and they can see January\u2019s dashboard. It all lives in one place for them.\u201d says Brittany Paxman, Senior Director and leader of the analytics practice at PulsePoint Group. According to Brittany, most companies conduct a brand reputation study once or twice a year. \u201cYou could be going down the wrong path for six to 12 months before you realize it, because you don't have the new data,\u201d shares Brittany. \u201cThe biggest, most significant impact [of Tableau] is that clients can adjust and respond pretty quickly.\u201d Today, clients can slice and dice data to track changes in brand perception, digging into dimensions like categories or product names to understand the root cause of changes. \u201cThe ability to add filters and easily segment the data by just dragging a dimension allows us to spot the factor that's dragging down a client\u2019s reputation. It's this topic or it's this brand or it's this division.\u201d \u201c[Tableau] serves two purposes. First, it's operational. So on the day to day, they can just know everything's OK, or something is wrong and we need to take some action really quickly. It's also analytical in that it allows them to segment that data in ways they never could before.\u201d Though PulsePoint Group\u2019s reputation services are in high demand, it faced a serious problem. It took too much time and too many staff resources to build reports for clients. \u201cWe had to do it manually,\u201d said Brittany. \u201cWe would have teams of people tagging content and creating charts. It could not be done with nearly as much frequency. We would do it once a quarter.\u201d And that just wasn\u2019t fast enough in a world where public sentiment can sour in a single day. PulsePoint\u2019s clients\u2014including major Fortune 500 companies \u2014must keep a close watch on how they\u2019re perceived in the marketplace. An unexpected blow to their reputation can lead to massive setbacks in sales and share price. Additionally, PulsePoint consultants would have to know the reports they needed to create before analyzing the data\u2014limiting exploration and leading to missed opportunities. \u201cWith Tableau, we can actually ask questions and say, well, what if we analyze it this way?\u201d \u201cWith a couple of clicks, I can give you a dashboard that will replace 20 PowerPoint slides,\u201d Paxman said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s been really powerful for our clients.\u201d ChannelMix constantly collects, cleans, and organizes data for PulsePoint\u2019s clients, so the firm always has access to up-to-date information in an analysis-ready format. The power to analyze this brand and reputation data in real time is a competitive differentiator for PulsePoint\u2019s clients\u2014allowing them to quickly react to trends, understand unique factors that influence their reputation, and forecast changes in the marketplace. By utilizing Tableau and ChannelMix, PulsePoint has turned reputation data from a service offering into an on-demand product with increased relevance and efficiency. \u201cIt's essentially a productized approach to measuring reputations that we can repeat for different clients. And it's highly customized,\u201d shared Brittany. The reputation dashboards are just one example of data\u2019s importance at PulsePoint, which specializes in organizational optimization, crisis management, and digital and communication strategy. The company also has helped several clients turn their data into shareable content with Tableau. \u201cThese companies are the gatekeepers to some really interesting information. And one of the ways that they can stand out is to use that data as content,\u201d says Brittany. \u201cOne of the strategic recommendations we\u2019ll make in the digital and communications space is that companies should be taking their data and using it as a marketing tool, using it as a way to build thought leadership, as a way to improve their reputation.\u201d For example, one of PulsePoint\u2019s clients wanted to help people in Southern California find cooling centers on hot summer days. The client simply started with a list. \u201cWe dropped that list into Tableau and suddenly, within five minutes, we had an interactive map and were able to make it a lot more engaging,\u201d Paxman said. \u201cWe took that map, uploaded to Tableau Public, and embedded it on the website as something users could use to go and find cooling centers.\u201d As a result, the client saw a much wider-reaching impact. Suddenly, the client\u2019s audience could see their proximity and engage with the visualization, versus a static, bulleted list. \u201cThe core reason we began using Tableau is because it enabled us to be better data analysts,\u201d says Brittany. \u201cWe were able to take the data that we had access to, visualize it quickly, and analyze and segment it in ways we never were able to do before.\u201d With Tableau, PulsePoint helps clients understand sentiment data, offering creative solutions to marketing problems. And with Tableau Cloud, PulsePoint\u2019s clients access data from anywhere, modernizing brand reputation tracking."

        "company": "Gyeonggi Infectious Disease Control Center",
        "content": "Gyeonggi Infectious Disease Control Center (GIDCC) is a Korean non-profit research institute that helps prevent and manage infectious diseases at the regional scale. GIDCC adopted Tableau to inform the public with more vivid, intuitive information on disease. Today, its staff and researchers explore and analyze data on 20-30 infectious diseases on a daily basis. With Tableau Server, they can share analyses with the provincial government and public health centers, increasing collaboration and accessibility across organizations. Tableau Public expanded the reach of information on infectious diseases, providing the ability to share findings with the public in an easy-to-consume format. With less time spent crunching numbers, GIDCC can more effectively manage infectious diseases. GIDCC delivers information on infectious diseases to relevant parties such as the provincial government and public health centers, sharing and applying feedback in real time. The organization operates a localized infection management system, conducting research to improve prevention and response systems and to increase the public\u2019s health literacy. GIDCC wanted to make information on infectious diseases three dimensional and intuitive to enhance citizens\u2019 understanding. However without a BI system for infectious diseases, GIDCC researchers had difficulties in quickly utilizing diverse data sources. Analyzing new data and taking new directions required long, complex, and repetitive processes. The organization needed an economical way to analyze data in support of public infectious disease prevention efforts. With Tableau and the expertise of a Tableau partner in Korea, PLANIT, GIDCC researchers significantly reduced analysis time from two to three hours per week to just 20 minutes\u2014an 89% reduction. They also reduced daily exploratory analyses to just below one hour\u2014giving researchers more time to make scientific progress instead of churning out reports. GIDCC is planning to develop this daily analysis work to daily bulletin service. In 2015, GIDCC launched an \u201conline system to inform the public about infectious diseases.\u201d In the process, they realized they could perform complicated statistical analyses and plot diseases on maps, including Seoul and Korea as a whole using Tableau\u2014which were big factors in the organization\u2019s analytical processes. While it had to respond to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) crisis, GIDCC team members discovered Tableau. With Tableau, GIDCC could map all administrative districts of South Korea and even connect to R. To better utilize Tableau, GIDCC started to post dashboards that showed occurrences of infectious diseases on maps of cities and districts in Gyeonggi-do, setting automatic data refreshes. GIDCC opened up these dashboards to Gyeonggi-do\u2019s public every week. Based on their success with Tableau Desktop, GIDCC took its earnest move forward the project using Tableau in September 2016. They utilized the expertise of PLANIT, Tableau\u2019s Korean partner, to understand the importance of building various links with outside systems and utilizing these systems to build a data warehouse to store health data and a portal service for professional users. Training, guidance and consulting services was provided by PLANIT to help GIDCC researchers and public health care servants to accomplish the project. Previously, researchers used Microsoft Excel and Google spreadsheets to provide information on the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases to outside parties including hospitals, government, and the general public. The data sources were fragmented and there was no consistency in data analysis. Today, GIDCC utilizes a single view of data for an agile BI environment and simplifies work processes regarding data collection and analysis. This enables outside researchers to actively participate and use visual data\u2014even if they aren\u2019t traditional analysts. With Tableau Public, GIDCC could expand the reach of information on infectious diseases, providing the ability to share findings with the public in an easy-to-consume format. This improved accessibility\u2014both in data and exploration\u2014will continue to improve reporting and the quality of infectious disease analyses. Over time, researchers have brought a variety of data sources into Tableau for analysis, including the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Emergency Department Information System, data from public corporation, and epidemiological studies in order to create in-depth analyses by disease, health clinic, population, and so on. For example, during the 2016 avian flu (AI) outbreak, GIDCC used Tableau as a communications tool to consolidate information from various institutions around Gyeonggi province, sharing mobile-optimized dashboards for field workers. With Tableau, GIDCC can utilize existing public information systems to influence action. As a result, GIDCC is better able to manage and prevent infectious diseases.

        "company": "Handok ",
        "content": "For about 60 years, Handok has provided a variety of healthcare products and services including good medicine, medical devices, health functional food, food for special medical purposes, and genetic analysis services to improve people\u2019s health and quality of life. Kyu Bum Lee, Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Handok adopted Tableau \u201cto bring sales related data from various sources and analyze them with diverse indicators. Today, approximately 900 executives and staffs have the foundation to analyze data. The executives and staff can increase visibility into sales and performance metrics and get more precise insights for portfolio management.\u201d Handok provides quality of products and services to improve people\u2019s health and quality of life. Handok also established various alliances with leading global pharmaceutical companies. With innovative healthcare service and management strategy, it is growing into a global total healthcare corporation representing South Korea. Handok regularly analyzes data around sales management, cost analysis, and inventory. But Handok\u2019s previous analytics tools only yielded static reports. The existing analytics could only create twenty types of reports and data sources were limited. With static reports, users couldn\u2019t drill down into the reports or customize them to suit certain business needs. Handok wanted to reinvent itself as a data-driven organization to enhance its own competitiveness and sales performance. As part of this goal, the company needed to enable the entire organization to analyze data\u2014even those who didn\u2019t hold traditional \u2018technical\u2019 roles. In order to meet these needs, Handok \u201cadopted Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server to empower employees in the field. With Tableau, we created an environment where we can create diverse analyses and safely distribute dashboards across the company. Staff and executives at Handok use Tableau to increase their insights into sales and utilize various data sources,\u201d said Kyu Bum Lee, Chief Information Officer at Handok. Before Tableau, the data of various departments were siloed, and analytics results were not shared and edited in real-time. The data also couldn\u2019t be connected with outside data. Thus, Handok wanted to integrate various data regarding sales into assets. Especially in Handok\u2019s BI system project, Tableau\u2019s Korean partner, Planit, was pivotal in helping to introduce to Handok a proven BI software which met the need of the business to be able to share dashboards through a web portal and integrate business data from both within and outside Handok. Planit provided training to Handok\u2019s sales and IT personnel which allowed them to enhance their data analysis capabilities with BI solution. Today Handok employees analyze and integrate data from roughly 86 data marts, over 10 million instances of third-party data, spreadsheet data, and over 140 million rows of drug distribution data from wholesale merchants. Employees create comprehensive financial reports based on profit and loss (P&L) as well as costs and start to analyze big data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA). Furthermore, employees can track key performance indicators and sales performance as well as interact with analysis report on mobile devices. After Tableau, employees noticed that there are less data silos across the organization and that departments were collaborating on analyses. Handok sales staff manually inputted sales activity data into spreadsheets and produced only 20 types of static reports. The IT department also managed the entire process from analysis to report creation. But since the adoption of Tableau, the IT department now focuses on supporting field staff and ensuring data quality and governance. Today, Handok employees can now build unlimited dashboards on their own and easily customize and iterate as their needs on Tableau Server. Handok can analyze correlations between sales activity and performance, track sales trends, compare sales staff performance, and instantly view sales forecasts with Tableau. Furthermore, it can make strategic decisions about stock units and utilize additional sales opportunities at the right time. With this insight, Handok remains more competitive in the market because it can quickly respond to trends in the pharmaceutical industry. With Tableau Server, Handok\u2019s executives and staff can share reports in real-time and access sales activity data on the go\u2014whether in the office or in the field. As a result, more and more business users are utilizing self-service exploration and advanced analysis.

        "content": "Novozymes is a leading global biotechnology company headquartered in Bagsv\u00e6rd, just outside of Copenhagen, Denmark. The company applies industrial biological solutions to challenge and complement traditional thinking in manufacturing processes and applications. Tableau has revolutionized Novozymes\u2019 approach to data analysis and collaboration. In addition to cutting reporting times by more than 90%, adopting Tableau has led to faster, more strategic decision making within departments like sales, global planning, and finance. With Tableau Mobile, Novozymes\u2019 sales force share key insights with customers, building relationships and driving revenue. Before Tableau, Novozymes\u2019 analysis occurred in Excel spreadsheets, extracting data out of their SAP BW environment. This static reporting led to long development times\u2014from one month, up to a full year\u2014for new business reports. \u201cBy the time the reports were rolled out to the organization, many employees didn\u2019t trust the data they were looking at,\u201d says Henrik Ferdinand, Head of Novozymes\u2019 Business Intelligence Competence Center. With Tableau, Novozymes democratized the data. Today, business users and developers all create dashboards in Tableau instead of IT developing reports for the entire organization\u2014reducing reporting times by up to 11 months. Now, IT can focus on more strategic tasks, while users are empowered to dig into their own data. Within six months, Novozymes rolled out Tableau Server access to 600 users within 6 months\u2014about 10 percent of the company. Departments like global planning, customer service and logistics, finance, and commercial support use Tableau to track key performance indicators. Even the business intelligence teams use Tableau to measure Tableau Server performance and usage metrics. \u201cWe chose Tableau because we could see a new market for visualizing data and Tableau allowed us to do this in much more intuitive ways,\u201d says Henrik. \u201cNow we can reach out to our end users with information much faster and they can even create and share dashboards of their own.\u201d To empower the sales team, the business intelligence team created opportunity dashboards\u2014an entirely new resource for the organization. They pull data directly from SAP BW and their CRM system into Tableau for analysis. With dashboards shared over Tableau Server, account managers can see how their accounts compare to others and discover new opportunities. They can also identify previously lost opportunities to reengage customers\u2014resulting in potential revenue that would have been lost using the old BI processes. Novozymes\u2019 sales team uses Tableau Mobile to share data directly to customers when out on the road. This has opened up new avenues of dialogue with key customers and helped build stronger customer relationships. \u201cTableau Mobile makes sharing information so much more flexible and our customers love it,\u201d says Henrik. \u201cNow our account managers can use tablets to provide key insights there and then, instead of having to huddle around a desktop back in the office.\u201d Tableau Mobile also allows account managers to access data directly from the field via a smartphone or tablet, improving business agility and cutting down on time wasted in between customer meetings. \u201cAs a sales tool, Tableau Mobile provides greater flexibility than ever before,\u201d explains Henrik. \u201cAccess to advanced analytics, no matter where you are, means you\u2019ve always got the answer when a customer needs it.\u201d Over the next two years, Henrik and his team plan to expand the Tableau user base to over 2,000 users, consisting of both employees and Novozymes customers. \u201cTableau has given us a new energy for reporting and analyzing information,\u201d says Henrik. \u201cIt\u2019s given us a more united, better user community in Novozymes.\u201d \u201cNow we can be much more dynamic as a company,\u201d concludes Henrik. \u201cWe can react quickly to new business trends and ensure we always stay one step ahead.\u201d"

        "company": "Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust",
        "content": "Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust is one of the UK\u2019s leading providers of community and mental health services. The trust employs 5,500 staff who deliver care to more than 1.3 million people across six boroughs of Greater Manchester, England. In an effort to improve processes, the Trust\u2019s information team implemented Tableau, quickly expanding to over 600 Tableau Server users that regularly access over 1,000 operational dashboards. With Tableau, the team cut reporting times by weeks, secured funding for new services, increased collaboration between employees, and improved the overall quality of patient care being delivered throughout the Trust. The Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust collects thousands of data points every day through more than 15 different information systems. Data collection ranges from clinical patient information to internal financial costs, incident reporting, and child services activity. Internal employees, commissioners, and NHS statutory bodies all rely on this data to effectively manage business processes. Before Tableau, the Trust was reliant on Excel and manual SQL queries for analysis, leading to long development cycles with poor data quality. And by the time a report came out, it was already outdated. As a result, many management staff simply didn\u2019t trust the data and were ignoring the reports altogether. In response, the Trust\u2019s information team adopted Tableau. Instead of Excel-based monthly reports, the team distributes Tableau dashboards to all operational managers in the organization. Staff can also connect directly to the Trust\u2019s data warehouse in Tableau, which contains data from both clinical and corporate systems. Today, teams can view comprehensive reports containing clinical, workforce, finance, and clinical governance data on a daily basis instead of waiting for weeks in long reporting queues. \u201cThis allows the Trust to understand what the services are doing and how they are performing,\u201d explains Ella Worsdale, Head of Information at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust. \u201cAll of a sudden, we can present data back really quickly,\u201d shares Ella. \u201cNow we've got reports in Tableau that people can access every single day and it's as live as we can make it. People can get what they need now, rather than waiting until next month.\u201d As a result, the information team has also seen a significant improvement in data quality and collaboration. This has allowed the information team to combine key information from all the Trust\u2019s different systems to determine what's really going on, both internally and externally. \u201cNow people trust the information they're getting and can make real service decisions based on it,\u201d adds Ella. \u201cIt's really changing the way we look at data and how that can influence decisions within the Trust. Tableau makes it accessible.\u201d Prior to Tableau, one of the key issues facing the Trust was a lack of responsibility for data amongst employees. The information team rely on data inputted into the information systems to create reports, but if there was ever a need to challenge the numbers, the individual who originally inputted it often didn\u2019t have the answers. \u201cFor a long time, data quality has been seen as a central problem that somebody else has to fix,\u201d explains Ella. \u201cPeople didn't understand the reporting process and weren\u2019t engaged with it, so they took the view it was someone else's fault if it went wrong.\u201d The Trust\u2019s Tableau deployment started within its Oldham location, the area with the most key performance indicator tracking, and eventually spread throughout the entire organization. With Tableau, attitudes around data have changed almost overnight, leading to a long-term cultural shift among Trust employees. \u201cTableau has improved the confidence the staff have in the data, which has, in turn, improved the confidence they have talking to commissioners and justifying the services they provide,\u201d comments Ella. \u201cAs a result, they've started taking real responsibility for their own data collection and performance.\u201d \u201cI thought a system like Tableau might make a difference, but I never realized how much of an impact it could really make, especially culturally.\u201d With over 600 employees throughout the Trust now fully engaged with Tableau, Ella and her team are able drive change in ways never previously possible, using insights uncovered in the data. \u201cBy examining the links between key pieces of information such as where referrals are coming from and the courses of treatment being taken, we can target the areas of the Trust where we can make a real difference\u201d says Ella. For example, the Trust has used data from Tableau to transform its children\u2019s services. \u201cWe had 10 different types of children\u2019s services all working in the same geographical area, but all in separate silos,\u201d explains Ella. \u201cUsing Tableau, we built a report to show that some patients were being seen by as many as seven different services at the same time, without the others realizing. This one report triggered numerous actions within the Trust to provide a more coordinated level of care to these patients. As a result, not only has our patient care improved, the overall efficiency of the children\u2019s services we provide has been greatly increased as well.\u201d The Trust is consistently using Tableau to support business cases and service transformations across the organisation. With more accessible data, the Trust can efficiently track demand for services and adjust funding accordingly. For example, with Tableau, the Trust identified a need for health promotion follow ups for patients who visited the emergency department (also known as A&E). After the Trust presented the data to the commissioners with Tableau, they made the case for process changes and secured money for the initiative. Tableau also helped Trust staff identify a growing demand on the pediatric medical service at the Oldham location. After analysing the data in Tableau, they had solid evidence that the service had both the capacity and the quality to meet demand in the area. They presented this data in Tableau, helping to secure additional funding from commissioners. \u201cThis is helping support conversations with our commissioner to ensure funding is secured in the right areas for the right reasons at the right level to provide quality care for patients in our localities,\u201d says Ella."

Today, thousands of sales people\u201490% of LinkedIn\u2019s sales force\u2014access Tableau Server on a weekly basis. With Tableau dashboards, sales can track performance and predict churn\u2014creating a more proactive sales cycle and as a result, increased revenue. LinkedIn\u2019s sales data\u2014sometimes close to a petabyte or more\u2014exists among internal databases, Google Analytics, Salesforce.com, and third party tools. Previously, one analyst on LinkedIn\u2019s team serviced daily sales requests from over 500 salespeople, creating a reporting queue of up to 6 months. In response, the business analytics team centralized this disparate data into Tableau Server to create a series of customer success dashboards. LinkedIn embeds Tableau Server into their internal analytics portal, nicknamed \u201cMerlin.\u201d Today, thousands of sales people visit the portal on a weekly basis\u2014equivalent to up to 90% of LinkedIn\u2019s sales team\u2014to track customer churn, risk indicators, and sales performance. \u201cWe decided to focus on how to scale the solution that we built and really provide the scalability and empower our sales team to get what they need in time,\u201d said Michael Li, Senior Director of Business Analytics. \u201cWhich is why we built this analytics portal. It became a one-stop shop for sales people to get what they need in a very self-service way.\u201d With Tableau, the sales team can now identify when a customer has increased product usage. With this knowledge, sales can proactively reach out to these customers to discuss potential opportunities or product engagement\u2014potentially increasing overall spend. Additionally, sales teams can track overall sales performance with the option to dig deeper to understand the underlying customer experience. \u201cSometimes it's dynamic,\u201d explained Michael. \u201cThe different sales teams may look at different ways to understand performance at their level so that they have a sense of urgency when things aren't going well, or when they know that they have been doing a good job and that they need to keep it up.\u201d To support deeper analysis, the business analytics team brings predictive models into Tableau to forecast churn\u2014empowering sales to increase customer success within at-risk accounts. \u201cWe built predictive models to predict which accounts are likely to churn. And then [we use Tableau to understand] the best way to prevent the churn from happening.\u201d \u201cTableau helps a lot in terms of getting data very quickly to visualize needs from our business partners, and then providing that in a very easy-to-consume way,\u201d Michael shared. Moving forward, the business analytics team continues to leverage LinkedIn\u2019s massive data investment to empower sales and marketing with actionable analytics. \u201cWe have a team of great analysts that\u2026will sit with their business partners to really understand what they're doing, understand what's needed from their side in terms of analytics support and figure out what technology is available to enable that, empower that, to help them optimize their business, and then create better solutions.\u201d All images are courtesy of LinkedIn Corporation."

Chief Information Officer, Tim Nall initially expanded Tableau across 1,000 global employees\u2014from marketing and finance to supply chain and operations. Tableau\u2019s subscription pricing fit with how Brown-Forman already operates, starting small and quickly scaling with demand. Today, marketing can track promotional effectiveness around the Kentucky Derby, helping forecast success for future campaigns. When launching new products, marketers understand how content resonates with consumers, increasing brand awareness and ultimately, helping ship more product. Brown-Forman is among the top ten largest global spirits companies, with offices across the globe. With this global reach, communication is paramount to determining best practices and selling more product. \u201cWe sell Jack Daniel's in Germany, we sell Jack Daniel's in France, we sell Jack Daniel's in the U.S. We want people to be able to see how these different entities are looking at their business so that we can leverage best practices better than we have in the past,\u201d explains Tim. This includes best practices around trans-national trade, where teams need insight into pricing and shipping details so they can effectively manage stock keeping units (SKU). All of this data lands in a Cloudera Hadoop Data Lake, running in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud, which is also where Brown-Forman runs Tableau Server. This allows Brown-Forman departments to leverage their existing technology investments and enables global teams to collaborate on best practices and share insights with Tableau. \u201cFrom a global perspective, it becomes more and more paramount to have all of this information and be able to discern it,\u201d says Tim. \u201cNow, with what we've created with our logical data warehouse and Tableau, people can collaborate and all of that information is accessible.\u201d At Brown-Forman, brand building is a foundation of the business: \u201cWe're passionate about building brands and when we refer to our employees, we say we had 4,500 brand builders. We\u2019d love to have everybody's title be \u2018brand builder.\u2019\" Brown-Forman\u2019s product family is extensive and continues to grow with new brands like Coopers\u2019 Craft bourbon, BenRiach scotch, and Glenglassaugh scotch. When Brown-Forman launches a new product, data is crucial to drive marketing strategy and to determine how to effectively connect with consumers. \u201cMarketing is starting to use Tableau to determine promotional effectiveness and where we should be spending our marketing dollars,\u201d shares Tim. With Tableau, Brown-Forman can track return on investment for marketing spend. With these insights, the marketing team can forecast promotion success for future campaigns\u2014simultaneously saving money and increasing brand awareness. \u201cHistorically with a new product, we would have gone to social media, probably some TV advertising, or maybe a billboard here and there. But now, with Tableau, we're able to really look at the value of that spend in those various arenas.\u201d Brown-Forman\u2019s Woodford Reserve is known as the \u201cofficial bourbon of the Kentucky Derby.\u201d As professed in a recent Woodford Reserve advertisement, \u201cIn Kentucky, horses are everything, and bourbon is everything else.\u201d During the Derby, attendees can purchase a $1,000 Woodford Reserve mint julep, giving them access to a special experience, complete with a historical display from the Kentucky Derby Museum, a collectable Mint Julep Royal Cup, and access to a branded bar at Churchill Downs. \u201cThis year, we're pretty excited that we'll be able to pull in a lot more social information to understand who's looking at content, who's going to our websites, and determine what they\u2019re viewing. For example, are they viewing the video of the $1,000 mint julep?\u201d The team also plans to overlay weather data to determine how rain or cold affected Derby promotions in the past and to predict how to approach these scenarios in future years. \u201cHere in Louisville, Derby can be hot, Derby can be cold. We've had snow on Derby in May before. So we're very excited that this year, we're going to be able to look at all the information that we now have to determine what we should do in the future\u2014what worked, what didn't work.\u201d \u201cOur whole goal is to promote and then ship more product following these promotions. Tableau is helping us reach that goal.\u201d As Brown-Forman modernized its data infrastructure, finding a visual analytics platform was the next logical step. \u201cWe were modernizing our whole data set. We landed on Cloudera as our logical file structure and we have an ETL tool, which is Talend,\u201d shares Tim. \u201cWe're bringing all this information in, we're putting it where it's readily accessible. We needed a tool that could take all of that great data and information and allow us to turn it into an insight.\u201d When Tim Nall, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer started searching for a visual analytics solution, he preferred a subscription model. \u201cWe were very comfortable with a subscription model. We\u2019re with Salesforce, we're with G-Suite, and we\u2019re with Workday. This is how we operate,\u201d explains Tim. \u201cThe subscription pricing model was a major factor in our decision to deploy Tableau as our enterprise-wide visual analytics platform.\u201d Brown-Forman adopted Tableau Desktop and Server in January of 2017. With subscription pricing, the company could quickly scale to around 1,000 global employees. And the added flexibility of a subscription model allows Brown-Forman to scale up or down as needs change. \u201cYou can start at any size you want. You can start with a big bang and go all out with your entire employee population if you so choose or you can start with a manageable number of people and allow it to scale up,\u201d says Tim. \u201cIf we determine that somebody needs to be a Tableau Desktop user and have that full-blown capability to build the models that we're after, then we can make a phone call and add that person.\u201d As more employees get excited about Tableau, Tim plans to expand licenses across the organization: \u201cWe plan to continue expanding Tableau to glean insights from everything from our global auditing process data to regulatory and plant issues to pricing and promotional effectiveness.\u201d To support their analytics strategy, Brown-Forman established an analytics center of excellence, headed by Commercial Finance with input from the CIO and CFO. \u201cWhat we've done with our whole strategy is we've said IT will be the one source of the truth,\u201d says Tim. With Tableau Server, IT can manage governance and security, while securing deployment flexibility. When a department wants to bring in a new data source for company-wide use, the center of excellence assesses the current infrastructure and determines the value of the investment. \u201cSomewhere there has to be a driver for the strategy and there has to be a home for your data scientists. You could say that this center of excellence was a block in our pyramid that always needed to be there.\u201d"

        "company": "Singapore Sports Institute",
        "content": "As part of its Vision 2030 master plan, Singapore Sports Institute (SSI) is working to develop homegrown athletes and coaches, and to make Singapore a force on the global sporting stage. Competing at the biggest sporting events means harnessing the power of data, and to achieve that requires the help of robust data analytics. With Tableau, SSI established an intuitive and user-friendly data ecosystem for decision-making across multiple stakeholders. Today, SSI uses Tableau to analyze performance from over 70 high-performance athletes across sports including swimming, badminton, and table tennis\u2014helping them effectively train for competitions and forecast success. Singapore Sports Institute is a statutory board of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY). The board has a single mission: to inspire and transform Singapore through innovative, fun and meaningful sporting experiences. With its Vision 2030 master plan, SSI hopes to create greater sporting opportunities for Singaporeans and support the development of professional capabilities and standards in coaching. Learning from professional and amateur sporting organisations across the globe to identify and sharpen details in training regimes using data, the government established the Singapore Sports Institute in 2009, a group that supports the development of Team Singapore athletes as well as the country's sports medicine and sports science industry. Performing at the very top level in athletics boils down to the minute details in the preparation and planning stages. As such, to predict favourable outcomes for the games, SSI collects high performance sports data from the national athletes. Benoit Ammann, Deputy Director of SSI, explains: \u201cAnalysing sports data is both an art and a science. The science is in analysing the data collected, and the art is in the application of this data to each athlete\u2019s training plans.\u201d However, before a business intelligence solution was implemented, data analysis at SSI was far from standard protocol. Different stakeholders like coaches, sports scientists, physiologists, and nutritionists kept their own records of individual athletes, and would manually key and analyse data on Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. This resulted in a high degree of variation and inaccuracies, as each party had different ways of gathering, interpreting and using data. \u201cThe data is not really very powerful unless you share it,\u201d says Mr Ammann. He explains that, despite adopting the correct approach and direction to support the athletes, these stakeholders often overlook the correlation between their individual decisions and the desired overall outcome. \u201cIf you change something in an athlete\u2019s diet, for example, how does that impact their psychology, their sleeping patterns, or their peak performance?\u201d Mr Ammann describes that changes in any of these variables, along with data inconsistencies, can make it challenging to effect quick and informed decisions on athletes' training plans. Performance data from SSI is critical in SSI\u2019s selection of the athletes who represent the nation at major sport events, such as the Olympics. Prior to establishing such a system, the process of selecting athletes for Team Singapore was time-consuming and prone to errors. It was based on manual calculations of multiple variables, without necessarily giving more weight to certain variables that have a statistically significant impact on peak performance. When it comes to performance data, where variables can have dramatic effects on competition outcomes, there has to be little \u2013 if any \u2013 room for misinterpretation. The SSI needed a robust data platform to quickly and easily make sense of the volume of raw data collected from multiple sources. It also had present the information in a manner that was not just clear and concise, but also usable by all the stakeholders involved in different aspects of an athlete\u2019s development. In looking for data analytics solutions that would tell a coherent and consistent story to the stakeholders involved, the SSI team evaluated various business intelligence solutions. However, some of the options required basic knowledge of coding, and were not sufficiently user-friendly. For Mr Ammann, the decision to use Tableau's data analytics solutions came from his previous interactions with similar organisations. \u201cI heard of Tableau being used in commercial companies, but my first encounter with it was during the time when I was working with other sports institutes who were already using Tableau for a while.\u201d These encounters also underscored to him the importance of data analytics in sports science. \u201cThe success of these teams, and the fact that they have been using Tableau to analyse their data, affirmed our decision to adopt Tableau as well.\u201d \u201cImplementing Tableau at SSI was a relatively straightforward process due to its ease of use and flexibility\u201d, said Mr Ammann. He found that it was easy to seek help from Tableau to solve technical challenges and keep dashboards up-to-date through Tableau's training sessions, online tutorials and customer conferences. After Tableau proved its usefulness and accuracy at a competition two years ago, the buy-in from SSI\u2019s internal stakeholders was almost unanimous. SSI then accelerated its process to introduce Tableau to other departments within Singapore Sports Institute, to enable more data-driven decisions. SSI now uses Tableau to support over 70 high performance athletes across sports including swimming, badminton and table tennis. Given that high performance sports analysis involves scrutinising athletes\u2019 performance down to the millionth of a second, Tableau\u2019s data-crunching capabilities support the coaches and scientists in their efforts to fine-tune the athletes\u2019 training regimes, while maintaining a holistic approach to their overall fitness and well-being. \u201cThe biggest impact that Tableau has had on SSI is the creation of an intuitive and user-friendly ecosystem that has enabled all our stakeholders to be aligned, especially where performance data is concerned,\u201d said Mr Ammann. Tableau offers individual stakeholders an advanced technology platform to facilitate information sharing. Using Tableau, datasets are easily collated, analysed, and presented on a dashboard that can be created within an hour. This has facilitated a more objective and data-driven decision-making process at SSI, instead of relying on arbitrary statistics and parameters. The science of analysing competition data, collected from top athletes in Singapore over a two-year duration, is applied to predicting the outcome of major sporting events, such as the upcoming 2017 Southeast Asian Games. The competition selection process is a tedious one, involving both quantitative and qualitative data sets. With the use of Tableau, SSI can simplify the analysis of individual athletes\u2019 performance data gathered from past competitions \u2013 such as their overall score and individual timing \u2013 and make informed predictions and projections for future games. Tableau\u2019s ease of use also helps SSI to create data-driven presentations that facilitate internal sharing and alignment. Tableau is proud to support SSI\u2019s adoption of data analytics technology as an integral component of SSI\u2019s Vision 2030."

        "title": "Pharmaceutical retailer, Apoteket, crafts retail strategy and increases promotion success with Tableau",
        "company": "Apoteket",
        "content": "Apoteket is a state-owned pharmaceutical retailer in Sweden, employing 3,200 staff across its 390 physical stores and online operations. To encourage company-wide collaboration, Apoteket adopted Tableau as its analytics platform. Today, the sales organisation can take a more accurate, strategic approach to retail strategy and marketing teams can analyse and share sales data with different departments. As a result of this self-service approach, Apoteket increased sales effectiveness and prevented costly mistakes. As the largest pharmacy retailer in Sweden, Apoteket has a wide range of data involving partners, promotional activities, and sales analysis. But the company didn\u2019t have a standard platform for data analysis\u2014leading to missed opportunities and insights. \u201cThe more we looked, the more we found instances of important data being stored at a local level, rendering it useless to the wider company,\u201d explains Mats Malhammer, Business Intelligence Architect. \u201cNot only was this hindering the day-to-day activity of numerous teams within the company, it meant important decisions were being made without all of the pertinent information to hand.\u201d Mats started to investigate the issue and determined the need for a analytic self-service business intelligence (BI) tool. For example, Mats witnessed that several members of Apoteket\u2019s business control team kept research data on their individual desktops or in local networks, which was only accessible to a handful of individuals\u2014leading to siloed information and potential for costly errors, such as not being able to compare and group data according to business requirements. After an extensive evaluation of Tableau Desktop, Microsoft Power BI, and Qlik, Mats chose Tableau for several factors including scalability, ease of use, and analytical depth. Initial installation was provided by local reseller Advectas, who not only helped on board the team at Apoteket, but helped them answer the relevant questions of their data, through Tableau. To start, the team acquired five Tableau Desktop licenses\u2014three within the business intelligence team and two within the business control team in charge of store performance. They also secured 37 Tableau Server interactor licenses to encourage company-wide collaboration, particularly across sales and marketing. Apoteket works closely with a wide network of pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail partners, selling their products both in-store and online, and conducting regular promotional activities. Before Tableau, Apoteket\u2019s marketing team found it increasingly difficult to track each partner\u2019s promotion success. As a result, the team struggled to determine which promotions were worthy of repetition and which partners it should be working with more frequently. Today with Tableau, data is now readily available to employees\u2014increasing collaboration between key business groups including sales, marketing, business intelligence and business control. The marketing team now uses Tableau dashboards to analyse promotional data. The team can determine effective promotions and flag stand-out campaign strategy for repetition, allowing the team to cut costs and focus resources appropriately. With automated reporting, the team can track online orders performance in almost real time\u2014a competitive differentiator in the fast-moving pharmaceutical industry. Mats\u2019 team can now quickly gather intelligence from across the company and be much more precise with their analysis. Leadership are impressed by the interactivity of Tableau dashboards and the ability to effectively track key performance indicators. \u201cWith Tableau, real insight is never more than a few hours away,\u201d says Mats. \u201cIt has transformed the way the BI team uses data for the good of the whole company, while encouraging other teams to be much more proactive with their data analysis needs as well.\u201d The previous lack of a business intelligence tool for analytics had a hindering effect on the productivity of Apoteket\u2019s business intelligence department. Since some key stakeholders within internal teams couldn\u2019t extract and analyse data on their own, many of them were leaning on Mats and his colleagues for help. Not only was this taking up a large proportion of the team\u2019s time, it was affecting their ability to conduct more business-critical tasks in a timely fashion. The upsurge in self-service analytics within Apoteket has quickly led to more creative uses of data and encouraged cross-departmental analysis. \u201cTableau has fundamentally changed the way we view and use data as part of our day-to-day activities,\u201d concludes Mats. \u201cAnalysis is now so quick and easy there\u2019s no excuse for anyone not to do it, while the information gained is often invaluable.\u201d This shift has reduced the reliance on the business intelligence team as a reporting factory for the whole company, saving many hours each day that can now be spent working on business-critical tasks and challenging assumptions with hard analysis."

        "content": "Lenovo India is a part of the global technology company with over 55,000 employees across the world and customers in 160+ countries. With Tableau, Lenovo\u2019s Analytics BI & Visualization team created a flexible sales dashboard that departments can adapt for ad-hoc analyses, leading to a 95% improvement in efficiency across 28 countries. The e-commerce teams analyze customer engagement metrics to craft a better online experience\u2014leading to better brand perception and increased revenue. Human resources consolidated 100+ static reports into a set of strategic dashboards, encouraging a data-driven approach to reach team milestones. With approximately 3,000 active Tableau users in 15 business units and more than 10,000+ users accessing Tableau dashboards, Santhosh Nair, Head of Analytics BI & Visualization explains how \u201creal-time decision-making is empowering stakeholders to drive business decisions faster.\u201d Before, Lenovo worked off of one single sales report in Excel, delivered to 28 different countries. When divisions and regions wanted to adapt the report, it required engagement from eight to ten people and led to an overwhelming queue of tasks for the analytics team. When Santhosh Nair, Head of Analytics BI & Visualization adopted Tableau as Lenovo\u2019s analytics solution, the team saw enormous efficiency improvements. \u201cIt used to take us maybe six to seven hours to create one single weekly report. So seven multiplied by 30 reports,\u201d says Santhosh. \u201cWith Tableau, we gained efficiencies by 95%. People are spending a lot more time doing their true job rather than just churning out reports.\u201d \u201cAs soon as we got our data practices in order, we deliver that data on a daily basis or even an hourly basis,\u201d says Marc Gallman, Senior Manager of Big Data Architecture. The improvements don\u2019t stop at 95%. Marc plans to keep increasing performance on the data side: \u201cOur goal within Tableau, for any click in the dashboard, we\u2019re trying to hit a 5 second or less performance.\u201d \u201cWe can actually use that valuable time for delivering insights back into the business, which will help decision makers make decisions and take actions that will ultimately benefit the company,\u201d shares Santhosh. The team can easily pull data from sources like Amazon Web Services and Hortonworks Hadoop Hive. \u201cThe engines are running faster so the dashboards or insights that we can deliver can be faster and more efficient.\u201d With Tableau, divisions can now take the comprehensive report and customize it to their needs\u2014leading to less ad-hoc requests and more tailored dashboard solutions. This report is now updated with current data up to three times per day instead of once a week. \u201cWe moved into one single consolidated report with a lot of interactivity,\u201d says Santhosh. \u201cPeople can actually look at those dashboards on their own, ask different business questions, get those answers up front and take decisions faster.\u201d User adoption continues to grow across Lenovo as senior executives understand the value of visual analytics. Lenovo started with an 8-core instance of Tableau Server and quickly scaled to a 16-core to accommodate user growth. Today, more than 10,000+ users access Tableau dashboards. \u201cWe started off with a very narrow business use case and then it quickly spread. Everyone wants to talk about big data analytics but Tableau simplifies it,\u201d shares Ashish Braganza, Director of Global Business Intelligence. \u201cWhen we first started with Tableau, we were just thinking about dashboarding and reporting. We never thought Tableau would fundamentally change the DNA of the organization,\u201d says Ashish. As adoption spreads, Ashish explains how the culture at Lenovo has shifted to take a more data-centric approach to challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about a solution or a technology, it\u2019s about how the culture towards data has changed.\u201d To govern Lenovo\u2019s data amidst this collaboration, the team integrated single sign-on with Tableau Server for a better employee experience. Tableau Server manages user access to Tableau resources based on the site roles stored in the local identity store. This helps Lenovo support self-service analytics at scale. Josh Fitzhugh, Senior Manager of Testing & Personalization on the Customer Experience Analytics Team explains, \u201cTableau has facilitated and helped the team figure out a way to take all these giant amounts of collective data and provide a delivery mechanism that works for everybody at scale.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m an eternal skeptic and Tableau blew me away as to how fast it spread through our organization,\u201d says Ashish. In a competitive e-commerce landscape, Lenovo needs to stay agile. \u201cIf we don't adapt then we will be lag behind and we will not be able to move the needle as fast as possible,\u201d shares Santhosh. To support this fast pace, Lenovo\u2019s analytics team pulls data from their unified customer intelligence platform (LUCI Sky) into Tableau to analyze the customer experience on their e-commerce site. Tableau dashboards show how customers interact with content at each stage of the customer journey, helping Lenovo teams more effectively target customers and ultimately, sell more product. Santhosh explains, \u201cTableau helps us map out the engagement journey, starting from exploration to the post-purchase scenario at different stages. This is being used by the organisation including the top-level executives to take decisions on a daily basis.\u201d In a recent article with Analytics India Magazine, Santhosh shared how Tableau helps Lenovo teams consolidate data sources to see the full scope of the customer experience. \u201cWe have created one unique dashboard by integrating 30 different data sources,\u201d says Santhosh. \u201cAll these data sources talk about customer feedback, which can be from social media, retailer websites, or surveys. We go through all of this data and run natural language processing to understand the themes or customers\u2019 sentiment about Lenovo products.\u201d \u201cReal-time decision-making is empowering stakeholders to drive business decisions faster, which will of course result in increased key success metrics like sales and revenue.\u201d The analytics team has enabled several divisions within Lenovo. One of them is their Human Resources department. Before Tableau, the Human Resources team churned around 100+ reports globally across talent acquisition, compensation, sales compensation, attrition, and headcount management. This led to a long reporting cycle, making it difficult for HR leaders to make data-driven decisions. Within just three months of using Tableau, Lenovo\u2019s Human Resources organization created a series of strategic insights-based dashboards, helping them reach major milestones within the division."

Fl\u00e1vio speaks about the success of Porto Seguro\u2019s deployment: \u201cThe experience has been very positive both with Tableau's professional services and partners,\u201d says Fl\u00e1vio. \u201cAs soon as we bought the licenses and built the environment, the support we received both from Tableau and its partner was critical. It made us realize how important the success of the project implementation was to both Tableau and its partner.\u201d A main objective for the business intelligence team moving forward is to double the amount of Tableau users within the company. When asked if he has any advice for new Tableau users, Fl\u00e1vio shares, \u201cAfter showing what you can do with Tableau, the result quickly spreads through the company and creates a strong demand.\u201d"

        "content": "GoDaddy is an international web hosting and internet domain registrar that serves 17 million customers and gathers 13 terabytes (TBs) of data each day, stored and managed in Hadoop. Today with Tableau and Alation, the Enterprise Data team increased control over data accuracy, empowering business units to access curated data sources certified by GoDaddy\u2019s data stewards. Now analysts spend less time searching for accurate data and more time analyzing it. As a result, the team continues to drive product development with data-driven decisions for a better customer experience. With hundreds of data sources spread across tens of platforms and 1400+ Tableau users, the team at GoDaddy needed a better way to enable trusted and accessible data to the organization. \u201cWe had multiple replications of that data. We had calculated fields that weren\u2019t documented,\u201d recalls Sharon Graves, Enterprise Data Evangelist and Tableau Server administrator at GoDaddy. \u201cFrom a business intelligence perspective, we had no real certainty of saying, \u2018OK, yes, this is exactly what I need to use to do my reporting.\u2019\u201d To empower self-service at scale, GoDaddy\u2019s Enterprise Data team adopted Alation\u2019s Data Catalog alongside Tableau, which inventories data sources and provides usage-based business context. Alation provides a complement to Tableau\u2019s approach to data governance by allowing end users to easily discover data from multiple sources and deeply understand the nuances of that data. Alation does this in a uniquely automated way by crawling and cataloguing an organization\u2019s data, the business semantics related to the data, and the logic of analysis embedded in an organization\u2019s analytic history captured through SQL query logs. The joint solution from Tableau and Alation, sits on top of a Hadoop footprint at GoDaddy comprising Apache Pig, a scripting platform for processing and analyzing large data sets, Apache Spark, a cluster computing framework, and Apache Hive. With this new data platform, GoDaddy automated many manual processes including creating automated alerts to ensure data loads properly. Also, business rules are uniformly applied at the time of processing. And that\u2019s not all. \u201cMuch of the metadata is captured automatically using machine learning in Alation, scanning query log files and profiling data on GoDaddy\u2019s servers,\u201d says Sharon. Data stewards use the combination of Tableau and Alation to curate data that is automatically inventoried in the Alation Data Catalog. Using Alation\u2019s curation features, stewards can confirm automatically recommended business semantics in order to capture the context of data. They can propagate tags for data sets that contain PII data or data sets that require management through data usage policies for other compliance considerations. They can also endorse or deprecate data sources in order to certify accuracy for corporate use and guide analysts and power users when they build analyses. \"The creation of the Enterprise Data team along with the implementation of these products gave a home to everything data at Godaddy,\" explains Sharon. \"It helped us solidify rules and management, which has greatly improved our end-user experience.\" The data enterprise team at GoDaddy deals with an influx of 13 terabytes per day: everything from website traffic metrics to customer purchase histories and internal statistics. Prior to the new solution, Sharon recalls how processes made data access slow, confusing, and frustrating for analysts at GoDaddy. \u201cOur power users who may not be intimately familiar with the data didn\u2019t know where to find the appropriate data for their analytics, or, if they did know where it was, they were not sure how to use it to meet their needs,\u201d Sharon says This new platform signaled a shift towards self-service analytics at GoDaddy. \u201cBy creating a self-service environment,\u201d Sharon says, \u201cGoDaddy product managers and business users can leverage data to create a better customer experience and find and design the product that will meet their needs by identifying trends and anticipating issues.\u201d Now that users can find the analytics they need, they spend less time searching for data and more time improving processes, resulting in a better product experience for their 17 million customers. Product managers and functional teams use Tableau dashboards to identify trends and spot potential issues before they arise. With data at their fingertips, they can dig into website trends and email campaigns to optimize product development. \u201cBy putting data in our end users\u2019 hands, they then had the ability to quickly pull together their own base-level reporting,\u201d Sharon explains. \u201cIf we see shoppers dropping out of the process at a given point, we can go in and relook at that flow to see if there\u2019s a better approach. These individuals were closest to the products and application changes and could quickly identify where something may need adjustment.\" Because previous analyst reporting involved pulling data from SQL, dropping it into a spreadsheet, and then sending out results via email, the Enterprise Data team had little insight into how data was used. Errors were hard to trace and even harder to stamp out. Now GoDaddy data stewards use Alation to scan thousands of Tableau workbooks, showing top users of each data source. With this knowledge, the Analytics and Business teams can get a better understanding of data usage throughout the company\u2014and they now know who to ping for further insight. This helps reduce large-scale, costly errors. \u201cWith the combination Alation and Tableau, GoDaddy's Enterprise Data team was able to examine the lineage of a table, search multiple data sources for a field, and increase visibility and control,\u201d says Sharon. In just a few clicks, they can view the popularity of various data sources within Tableau Server, where data is being used and by whom, and can search through hundreds of data sources for a specific field.

This new self-service approach allows the IT team has time to focus on more strategic projects \u2014 reducing BI-related IT costs by 20%. Today, the company can quickly respond to market conditions, opening up new business opportunities. \"About a year and a half ago, we realized that our traditional BI solution was no longer delivering against the requirements of our highly digital business,\" says Steffen Heilmann, Head of IT at MYTOYS GROUP. Employees in procurement, marketing, logistics, and customer support based daily decisions on static reports that had to be prepared manually. When asking additional questions and requesting further analyses, departments often had to wait for the results. In early 2016, MYTOYS GROUP adopted Tableau to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and create one source of truth for the company. \"We wanted to have an effective, easy-to-use tool that would allow departments to generate their own reports and analyses whenever they required. At the same time, we wanted to free our IT staff from the repetitive report generation tasks. In short, we wanted to deploy self-service BI to create higher data transparency, better process speeds, independence, and flexibility,\" explains Steffen. \"We wanted employees to have all the data they need for their daily business, to be able to develop new ideas, come up with and test hypotheses themselves. We also wanted them to be able to drill down into the data as far as necessary to determine the cause for any undesirable developments.\" After an initial evaluation of ten competitors in the BI space, the IT team selected Tableau due to their success during the free trial period. \"Tableau has everything we need to evolve towards an even more data-driven business,\" explains Steffen. Today, about 30 employees in procurement and marketing use Tableau dashboards to explore their data in an interactive way. Underlying data is stored in the company\u2019s Oracle Exadata X6 data warehouse. This includes customer data from web stores, finance, and transactions, logistics data from the Oracle ERP system, along with server status and tracking data from mostly external sources. While MYTOYS is in the process of expanding its Tableau deployment, the IT team supports employees with training and ongoing questions. As interest grows, the company is considering rolling out Tableau Server across the entire company. \"Even though we are still in a very early stage of deploying our new BI platform, we are already seeing results,\" says Steffen. \"Our departments have become significantly faster and more flexible. With Tableau, our specialists don\u2019t have to wait for reports, but can get to all the data relevant in their daily work themselves and define their own models and hypotheses.\" \"At the same time, they are no longer dependent on the IT department or external partners. They no longer have to wait for current reports to be published or a new ad-hoc query to be run by IT.\" Empowering the departments also means unburdening the IT from tedious routine tasks. Steffen Heilmann is very pleased with the cost savings achieved with the new project: \"By deploying Tableau self-service BI, we figure we have decreased our IT costs by roughly 20%. Of course, that opened up IT capacities for other important projects. Overall, we have gotten faster and better in the departments, while at the same time saving a lot of money and effort in IT. What more could we want?\" Re-building their business intelligence strategy from the ground up has also allowed MYTOYS to define a unified set of KPIs and consistently apply them throughout all areas of the business. \"Now we are all talking about the same facts. There is a single source of truth, and the sometimes endless discussions over data validity of old have gone quiet.\" With 1,500 employees, MYTOYS runs web stores in German, English, and Russian, as well as 14 retail stores throughout Germany. In addition to its core toy business, MYTOYS\u2019 portfolio has grown to include a wide variety of other products from categories such as decoration, clothing, shows, and furniture. Within the product-side of the business, procurement uses Tableau to find answers to questions regarding units sold vs. units ordered, prices, and revenue. Employees monitor the company\u2019s progress against quota, observe which products are selling well and why, keep track of what they need to back order, and identify under-performing products. With Tableau, they can determine ideal order amounts and order timing\u2014helping to forecast demand and save money. Meanwhile, the IT department runs its internal analytics on Tableau. The team built an availability report tracking all support tickets by severity and processing time. Visual time series analysis allows precise estimates, and users can drill down in order to identify root causes behind outliers. This allows users to discern past and current availability levels and SLA fulfillment at a glance. Going forward, MYTOYS plans to fulfill all reporting and analytics requirements using Tableau \u2013 from procurement to marketing, to logistics and even in customer support. MYTOYS\u2019 goal is to provide our marketing team with more insight into their market and its real-time trends, allowing for more precise segmentation and ultimately, a more targeted approach. The company also plans to analyze customer behavior at retail locations, the effectiveness of voucher campaigns and marketing measures, as well as customer specific conversion rates and reasons for abandoned transactions. With Tableau, MYTOYS hopes to achieve well-targeted optimizations for an increase in revenue. \"We are confident to have built a solid foundation for company-wide self-service BI with Tableau, gaining a massive advantage for our company,\" sums up Steffen."

        "content": "Panoramic Power uses IoT sensor technology to help customers understand energy consumption, collecting eight billion data points per month across 800 sites in 30 countries. With Tableau, Panoramic\u2019s customers can dig deeper into their data, like The North Face who saved $10,500 through early detection into HVAC systems or Strauss Group who saved $250,000 a year by correlating weather data with energy use. Automated reporting allows customers to quickly understand key metrics, without needing to rely on Panoramic\u2019s professional services team\u2014freeing up 9 hours per week that Panoramic can now dedicate to customer care. Panoramic Power is a global energy management company, combing the Internet of Things and cloud-based analytics. Since 2009, the company has installed more than 30,000 of its unique self-powered, wireless sensors at 800 customer sites around the world. Each sensor is clamped onto the outgoing electrical wires of a customer\u2019s on-site circuit breaker. Once installed, it monitors the flow of electricity, sending information wirelessly to Panoramic\u2019s cloud- based analytics platform every ten seconds. When Ido Kotler joined Panoramic as Director of Professional Services in 2013, he discovered that customers increasingly sought more complex analyses that went beyond the capabilities of its existing web application. As a result, Ido\u2019s team was inundated with requests that consumed a significant amount of time and resources. \u201cMore and more, our customers were demanding more customized reports and data analysis,\u201d explains Ido Kotler, Director of Professional Services. \u201cThey were looking to perform analyses that were simply too time-consuming to produce using the tools and resources available.\u201d The company decided to embed Tableau into its SaaS solution to help customers like North Face, Strauss Group, and Wrangler understand energy consumption and asset performance\u2014identifying areas where they can save money by improving processes and reducing energy consumption. Panoramic now has five active Tableau Desktop users split across Israel and the US along with Tableau Server interactor licenses, available to both internal employees and its customer base. Ido plans to increase this number in the near future through a combination of training sessions and new hires in the professional services department. The North Face, a VF Corporation brand, adopted Panoramic Power\u2019s SaaS solution within four of its highest trafficked Calfornia locations. Across locations, 150 sensors feed real-time data into Panoramic\u2019s platform, powered by Tableau. The North Face uses Tableau dashboards to track load level and real-time energy data, helping stores optimize energy consumption, infrastructure, and behaviour. After VF Corporation\u2019s success with Panoramic Power across North Face stores, the company adopted its solution within Wrangler\u2019s Distribution Center. With real-time sensor data flowing into Tableau dashboards, management can explore data to uncover opportunities for operational efficiency. With Tableau Desktop and Server, Panoramic can now communicate with its customers in ways that were previously not possible. Automated reporting in Tableau allows customers to easily update dashboards\u2014saving Ido and his professional services team several hours each week. And customers get the insights they need, when they need them. Panoramic customer, Strauss Group, an international food and beverage company, wanted to correlate key variables in its main Israel warehouse\u2014such as chiller temperature against outdoor temperature\u2014in a bid to identify significant energy savings. With Tableau Server, Strauss can pinpoint how energy consumption in its food warehouse correlates against outside temperatures on a monthly, daily and hourly basis. Using this data, Strauss Group adjusted its warehouse air conditioning settings, yielding an annual saving of more than $250,000 on its energy bills. \u201cWith Tableau, it took less than half a day to identify exactly where key energy savings could be made in our warehouse, something we\u2019d previously been working on for a long time, without success,\u201d comments David Rosenberg, a civil engineer at Strauss Group. \u201cTableau makes it possible to pinpoint specific energy consumption problems that would otherwise have likely remained undiscovered.\u201d Initial installation and training support was provided by a local reseller, SIT. Panoramic employees continue to use Tableau\u2019s online training materials to enhance their skills. \u201cWith such a powerful BI solution at our fingertips, we knew how important it was to understand everything it was capable of so that we could maximise the benefits for our customers,\u201d explains Ido. \u201cTableau\u2019s online training centre proved an invaluable tool, giving us confidence in our abilities as users and ensuring we could quickly respond to customer requests, no matter how complex.\u201d Despite being originally implemented as a customer solution for the professional services team, several other groups within Panoramic quickly took note of Tableau\u2019s benefits and began to adopt it for their own internal and external purposes. This includes the sales team, which swiftly integrated Tableau into Salesforce for customer pipeline tracking and analysis, while the marketing team now uses Tableau visualisations on brochures and presentations. It has also caught the attention of the senior leadership team, which now uses Tableau dashboards to review company financial reports instead of traditional Excel charts and PowerPoint presentations. Today, the leadership team uses Tableau to track key performance indicators like business growth metrics, pipeline versus deployments, churns, and renewals. \u201cThe impact of Tableau both inside and outside of Panoramic has been tremendously high,\u201d concludes Ido. \u201cIt has taught us the power of effective business intelligence and fundamentally changed the way we operate as a company. We\u2019ve always been a data-driven company, but only now do we realise just how much we are able to do with this data, both for ourselves and for our customers.\u201d"

        "content": "More than 41 million people and 74,000 organizations trust Box to store content in the cloud. These customers constantly emit data that holds critical answers about how to accelerate growth or streamline operations. Today with Tableau, over 1,100 Box employees can turn millions of rows of data from sources like Amazon Redshift into actionable insights around product usage and customer demographics. For example, Box analysts discovered a growing product presence in countries like India and Saudi Arabia, leading to a more strategic distribution of resources. And Tableau usage continues to grow as executives replace static PowerPoint slides with interactive dashboards, inspiring strategic decision making from the top down. Starting with just a few Tableau Desktop licenses, more and more teams started adopting Tableau. About a year later, the company migrated to Tableau Server. Today, over 1,100 Box employees access Tableau workbooks on a daily basis. Teams at Box leverage Tableau to understand how customers use the product\u2013\u201cfeatures they use, how they use it, how are they not using it,\u201d and ways to make the experience better. \u201cPeople should have access to the numbers and they should be able to understand how people interact on the product\u2014if certain investments are paying off or if they're not paying off,\u201d says Abhishek Gupta, Senior Analyst. \u201cInformation is truth and our dashboards are open to everyone in the company.\u201d Box is a multi-platform product. With Tableau, teams can understand what devices customers are coming from to optimize the user experience. \u201cYou can use Box from your web browser or desktop clients or mobile products. So a lot of our dashboards look at all these various activities, and how and where they access their data from,\u201d says Abhishek. \u201cWe have international data, we have multiplatform data, and when you combine those two you can see the things you read about, like how mobile growth is expanding all over the world. You actually see it in your own data and in how people use your product.\u201d For example, Abhishek explains how his team uses Tableau dashboards to determine markets with high growth\u2014international versus domestic. They can then determine which devices are most popular in these regions. \u201cOne of the more interesting insights we found was countries like Saudi Arabia or countries like India actually have a huge Box presence, especially on mobile products like Android, Blackberry, Windows,\u201d says Abhishek. With insights like these, Box can make strategic decisions about where to invest resources and re-target consumers with potential solutions. \u201c[For example, these insights] may tell you that you have a Middle East presence and maybe offices in other countries can start focusing on it, start using those users as a potential up-sell opportunities.\u201d With Tableau, Box can access millions of rows of data stored in Amazon Redshift\u2014supercharging analyses. \u201cTableau can connect to Redshift really fast. Redshift has very, very fast query processing time, because it's columnar based so it works very well. I would say Tableau plus Redshift\u2014it feels like it's one thing. It works really well together,\u201d shares Abhishek. Abhishek explains how Box got up and running with Tableau and Redshift really quickly\u2014saving the engineering team time and creating a seamless experience for ad-hoc analysis. \u201cLet's say you have an analytics team or a database engineering team setting it up. They're not going to spend days and days. You can get up and running in minutes. I've set it up on my own.It's really quick.\u201d \u201cAnd then with Tableau, you just hook it up to the Redshift server, connect, run a query, and publish it to the Server and you're literally done in an hour. It\u2019s great\u2014it feels like one product.\u201d This newfound data transparency allows for increased collaboration between teams, offering a central source of truth for company data: \u201cTableau is going to be a great central place to go and access information. And that's going to be really critical because as people ask more questions, they need to create more dashboards [and conduct] more analysis. And so that will be huge,\u201d says Abhishek. Instead of relying on static PowerPoint slides for meetings, teams now point to Tableau dashboards to show real-time data\u2014reducing manual data preparation. And after meetings, users can reference data as it changes. Even executives benefit from this approach. Abhishek shares how executives pull up Tableau dashboards in meetings to track company goals: \u201cWe have meetings with some regular cadence where we look at some [company] numbers. I've seen some executives do the whole meeting off of Tableau dashboards.\u201d"

Gannett\u2019s HR executives use Tableau to review HR trend data across categories like employee compensation, turnover, and diversity. With Tableau, leadership can understand the implications of crucial decisions and if necessary, adapt strategies in the future. Previously Gannett\u2019s Human Resources monthly HR Executive report was a text-based, 25-page report, compiled through a data call and manually updated by Gannett\u2019s legacy reporting team and various members of the HR team. After Gannett and TEGNA split, a new People Analytics team was formed. One of their first charters was streamlining reporting to create an overall HR Executive Dashboard. Gannett\u2019s People Analytics team used Tableau to combine all relevant data fields from multiple systems and create an overall HR Executive Dashboard for the Gannett executive team (GET). The new HR GET report consists of 12 interactive dashboards across multiple categories such as labor spend, demographics, hiring, requisitions, and terminations. The report also includes a \u201cspecial interest\u201d analysis dashboard to highlight a relevant monthly topic, helping leadership understand the impact of decisions. For example, in the case of an acquisition, they can understand the implications on HR metrics. \u201cTableau has allowed our People function to provide better and more relevant data, supporting decisions around our human capital. Our function provides consistent and relevant data, helping to drive our business forward,\" commented Dave Harmon, Chief Human Capital Officer. Today, Gannett moved to a single Ceridian Human Capital Management system, where they continue to source data for executive reporting. The media industry is in a constant state of consolidation. Gannett\u2019s revenue by full time employee (FTE) and labor spend dashboards allow the GET team to quickly see the financial implications related to the HR actions, like company acquisitions or reductions in force. In addition, the People Analytics team can measure these metrics against businesses of similar sizes using CEB data. Kevin Moore, Head of People Analytics explains \u201cExecutives use Tableau to see the implications associated with business decisions. With Tableau, they can effectively track these metrics. During periods of change, executives watch our total labor spend\u2014and whether this metric is increasing or decreasing.\u201d Gannett also uses Tableau to extend analyses to other areas. For example, with Tableau, the team joined HR and Salesforce data to understand the characteristics behind a winning sales opportunity. The dashboards allowed sales leadership to quickly understand win rates by key areas such as sales rep tenure, industry, market, and sales cycle. Kevin stated, \u201cThe flexibility of Tableau allowed us to quickly answer questions from Sales Leaders who wanted to focus on a specific Sales Rep Type or Sales Rep Team. Once the data was in Tableau and the worksheets were designed, any change to columns, rows and filters took a matter of seconds.\u201d Gannett\u2019s demographic and hiring representation dashboards help HR executives track minorities, females, and veteran\u2019s data against established Civilian Labor Force goals\u2014along with turnover rates. These insights help establish a diversity focus within HR GET reporting and as a result, reinforce a dedication to diversity across the company. With these dashboard, executives can drill down to better understand spikes and drops. For example, Kevin shared a time when a senior leader requested an age breakdown of all employees who voluntarily left company. \u201cWe were quickly able to go into our Tableau workbook and complete a drilldown and see that majority of the people leaving voluntarily were in one specific age segment,\u201d Kevin recalls."

        "company": "Zedi",
        "content": "Zedi is a leading oil and gas technology and services company operating in Canada and the United States\u2014managing 1.3 million sensors that generate over 47 million daily data points. Zedi\u2019s CTO chose to embed Tableau Server into the Zedi AccessTM platform, enabling customers to quickly spot equipment or production issues and prevent monetary loss. Zedi also uses Tableau internally, creating a single source of truth for financial and operations data. Tableau is transforming Zedi's approach to analysis, helping save the company two weeks per month on report creation. With help from Tableau, Zedi is creating market differentiation with their embedded service, reducing churn and sustaining a higher recurring revenue stream. Zedi AccessTM\u2014Zedi\u2019s SaaS remote asset management solution\u2014helps customers track the health of production equipment along with the production process that these assets support. Sensors located in customer upstream field operations send data back to the Zedi cloud platform, where it\u2019s stored in an Oracle database. Zedi shares the analytics output with customers over Tableau Server, embedded into Zedi AccessTM. Data updates in real time or on a scheduled basis, depending on the customer. Previously, Zedi struggled to find an efficient, scalable analytics platform to integrate into Zedi AccessTM. \u201cThe old solution was really awkward and slow and clunky, and it just was not a good experience,\u201d said Doug Watt, Senior Technology Product Manager. After proving the value of Tableau Server within Zedi AccessTM, the IT team adopted Tableau Desktop and Server internally to support analytics needs across the company. Doug continued, \u201cTableau has the performance we need for our customers and the scalability required for our internal deployment.\u201d Zedi\u2019s IT team manages data quality and governance, enabling business process owners to dive into their own analytics. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen creativity and capability pop up all through the organization, leading to more innovative solutions to business challenges,\u201d says James Freeman, Chief Technology Officer. Typically an oil and gas producer wouldn\u2019t be able to spot production interruptions until the close of month in some cases. With Zedi AccessTM, customers use Tableau dashboards to track the health of equipment in real time. If a sensor hasn\u2019t called in \u201cthree days or three weeks or three months, they\u2019re still paying for it,\u201d explains Doug. \u201cThat's a risk, because if something\u2019s failed with that device, they're not getting any value from it.\u201d If production suddenly falls off, companies often scramble to deploy field forces to deal with the issue. With Tableau dashboards, customers can spot, respond, and resolve issues within one day\u2014reducing downtime and decreasing the monetary risk that comes with an outage. \u201cEvery one of those molecules that comes out has an economic value to the customer,\u201d says James. \u201cReducing downtime is preserving uptime\u2014preserving the ability to produce cash.\u201d \u201cTableau is critical to delivering those types of insights, because it's about how you visualize data in a way that's efficient and allows customers to quickly sift through all the reams of data to get to the points that they most care about,\u201d explains Doug. Internally, the Zedi team uses Tableau to visualize the time-series structured data from over 1.3 million sensors deployed in the field. If a customers\u2019 sensors aren\u2019t calling in as normal, data from Zedi AccessTM displays as an outlier in Tableau and notifies the customer. \u201cWe feel that it has helped differentiate us, allowing us to reduce churn and sustain our higher monthly recurring revenue,\u201d says James. Similarly, if the team begins to see a trend in failed sensors, Zedi can proactively deploy field staff, preventing a potential disruption to production. Zedi also uses Tableau to help support and grow its business. For example, Zedi\u2019s finance department brings data from Microsoft Dynamics GP into Tableau\u2014transforming the company\u2019s approach to financial analytics. Product managers are responsible for profit, loss, and financial reporting on different lines of business and solutions. Before introducing Tableau, the analytics team extracted data out of Microsoft Dynamics, bringing it into Microsoft Access and finally, Excel. This process led to long reporting cycles of up to two days per month for each of Zedi\u2019s seven product owners. The data \u201cwas inconsistent, and everybody had their own different graphs, and they had their own different filters,\u201d recalls Doug. This led to confusion between product managers and the finance team and ultimately created distrust in the data. With Tableau, the IT team built out a set of core dashboards with the finance team, which acts as a single source of truth for financial reporting for the whole company. \u201c[The finance team] controls how they pull that data out, when they pull that data out, and what data needs to be in there,\u201d explains Doug. With faster, more accurate reporting, Zedi reduced reporting time by two weeks per month, allowing employees to focus on more strategic projects that move the business forward. Zedi continues to find creative ways to analyze internal data. For example, Zedi\u2019s analytics team recently started blending data from MS Dynamics and Salesforce in Tableau with plans to gain a 360-degree view of the customer experience from billing and customer care to actual use of the Zedi AccessTM product. Along with sensors, Zedi also builds and manufacturers pump jacks. The team is starting to do predictive analytics in R, displaying the results in Tableau to make it easier to diagnose issues near real-time. Zedi is now actively expanding applications of Zedi AccessTM and its underlying IoT platform to industries beyond oil and gas. Tableau will continue to play a crucial role as Zedi\u2019s analytics platform of choice due to its flexibility and configurability. In the meantime, Zedi plans to expand both their internal and external deployments. James notes, \u201cOur employees throughout the business understand their data better. Rather than making them translate their needs to IT, I want to give them the tools to build their own dashboards and look into their own data. Features within Tableau along with the distributed client licensing make this decentralized enablement possible.\u201d"

This new solution reduced the manual effort required for profitability calculations from days to a few mouse clicks. And this new transparency allows teams to assess capacities and profitability within moments to quickly identify under-performing regions, leading to more proactive countermeasures and securing a long-term increase in profitability and competitiveness. Competition in the telecommunications market is increasing, affecting pricing and low-bandwidth subscriber line numbers. This makes it difficult to balance service coverage and profitability. It is also challenging to identify areas that warrant infrastructure investments and to measure business effects from declining prices, new technologies, or additional competitors. \"Correctly attributing the various costs proportionally to each individual customer required a deep understanding of each cost factor,\u201d recalls Markus Kolp, Business Intelligence Analyst at M-net. \u201cThe necessary data came from a number of diverse sources such as SAP, billing, third-party calculations for rented lines, address data, technical documentation of line capacities and many more.\" If customer numbers or line capacities in surrounding areas changed, the analyses had to be rerun. Every customer request for additional bandwidth required a time-consuming investigation of technical and cost-relevant circumstances. Due to the complexity, there was always a risk of neglecting or misallocating important information. And spreadsheets made it difficult to quickly understand data surrounding bandwidth capacities. M-net decided to target the root of the problem. \"We wanted a tool that would automatically consolidate the required data and allow easy individual analysis. But at the same time we wanted it to offer geographical visualizations of areas or regions in the form of maps,\" explains Markus Kolp. The in-house Oracle data warehouse did not include all the relevant data sources, so the new tool also needed to be able to easily connect to many diverse data sources and allow for advanced analytics. M-net originally used ArcGIS to map profitability by customer. But it quickly became clear that this would require a disproportionate amount of time and labor to scale across business units. \"In the end, we decided to go with Tableau,\" says Markus Kolp. \"Especially because it was best able to handle the geographical visualization.\" Once the decision was made, M-net purchased ten Tableau Desktop licenses and started to develop a set of dashboards for analysis and presentation that included business and technical data of both their customers and networks. This was internally nicknamed the \u201cExpansion Cockpit.\u201d Today, about 20 employees from the strategy, technology, and sales departments regularly use the new Tableau solution. Users can see a map of the more than 300 connected MDF (Main Distributor Frame) service areas. They can also track essential key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, costs, number of contracts, employed products, or market share and the development of these KPIs over time. The Expansion Cockpit shows data of both the business and technical sides of the M-net network. Employees can drill into technical data such as network topology, backbone lines, and MDF connections, including their respective bandwidths. At the same time, they can see the entire customer journey through details like line contract run time, costs, revenue, address, or technical connection info. The business intelligence team led by Markus Kolp creates and distributes reports via email. Employees view them with Tableau Reader. A variety of departments at M-net use Tableau dashboards to drive decision making. The strategy department uses the analyses to create long-term forecasts and to validate investment decisions. The technology department always has the latest information about connection types and network capacities across regions. And the controlling department gains important insight into the profitability of customers and infrastructure. Aside from the Expansion Cockpit, M-net uses Tableau for a number of other applications at M-net. The engineering department, for example, is improving their level of service by monitoring network traffic data, analyzing performance, identifying high traffic volumes and evaluating error messages by frequency and processing time. The finance department uses Tableau to monitor customers' payment performance, identify credit risks and fraud attempts and to analyze unpaid items over time. And the strategy department is running a customer intelligence program to identify general and region-specific trends in their data about customers, contracts, revenue, costs, usage, and competition. This allows them to provision for future requirements ahead of time. Today, employees benefit from self-service analytics. To on-board customers, M-net relies on online training resources and the Tableau community forums. We were able to work our way into Tableau independently,\" says Markus Kolp. \"The online documentation and the Tableau-Community were very helpful. Other than that, we do benefit from exchanging information with Tableau employees and we regularly visit Tableau Conference.\" For many M-net employees, the new Tableau solution has changed the way they work. Technical analysis or profitability checks used to require days, collecting revenue and cost numbers from various data sources. Then everything had to be proportionally attributed and calculated in massive spreadsheets. With Tableau\u2019s native connectors, the business intelligence team brings in data from their Oracle data warehouse. And now, they can bring other data sources, enriching their analysis. Today this type of analysis only takes a few clicks. This time savings allows M-net technicians to forecast the effects of current and future customer numbers on network performance. Decisions become more proactive as technicians can order additional capacity or cancel superfluous bandwidth as needed. Typical questions such as revenue over time or churn rates are answered at a glance. Tableau\u2019s mapping capability allows employees to drag and drop KPIs\u2014helping them understand how individual items are interconnected within the big picture. \"Today, we can discern situations at a glance, along with their underlying conditions. Before, they were very difficult, if not impossible to spot with spreadsheets,\" Kolp explains. \"But our Tableau solution doesn\u2019t just save us a lot of work with each analysis,\" he adds. \"The KPIs in our Expansion Cockpit are always up to date. We don\u2019t have to recalculate them every couple of weeks as customer numbers or network capacities change.\" With the new transparency regarding its network topology and the cost-benefit situation of every individual customer, M-net identifies unprofitable MDF areas. M-net has already begun implementing countermeasures \u2013 such as purchasing cheaper lines, reducing line capacities, redoubling sales efforts, or completely abandoning unprofitable areas \u2013 in order to restore or improve profitability. \"In the mid- to long term, we are definitely going to see the results of these activities in our bottom line,\" Kolp assures us. \"Our success with Tableau has percolated through the entire company. More and more colleagues come to us with additional ideas or requests. And many other data analysis use cases for Tableau are becoming apparent. There is a huge potential for optimization that we want to tap into over the coming weeks and months.\" The team is moving all geographic analyses and reports, previously distributed over ArcGIS and email, into interactive Tableau dashboards. The insights gained from using the Expansion Cockpit are already driving its further development and generating new requirements. There is a desire to meet future challenges with the support of data. For example, there are plans to add all Telekom MDF locations \u2013 including those not used by M-net \u2013 and related market and competition information to the Expansion Cockpit. Markus Kolp sums up his experience with Tableau: \"By knowing exactly what the cost-benefit ratio is at each and every connection point, M-net is able offer custom tailored and profitable solutions to private households and business customers alike. That gives us a significant competitive edge. Investment decisions such as connecting new service areas or adding network capacities are now based on reliable information. That opens up additional business opportunities while at the same time, greatly reducing our risk.\""

        "content": "The Coca-Cola Company is the world\u2019s largest beverage company, with over 500 brands and 3,900 products. Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated (CCBCC) is Coca-Cola\u2019s largest independent bottling partner. With Tableau, CCBCC\u2019s IT and business intelligence teams replaced a daily, 45-minute, manual reporting process. Today, teams can understand metrics like delivery operations, budget, and profitability with a few clicks, consolidating data from hundreds of disparate sources. As a result, sales teams can now access mobile dashboards on iPads in the field, increasing timeliness to sell more product. And now, executive reports automatically refresh in Tableau Server on a daily basis, driving strategic decision making. Coca-Cola Bottling Company\u2019s (CCBCC) business intelligence team handles reporting for all sales and delivery operations. Shawn Crenshaw, Senior Business Analysts explains how the team answers questions such as: \u201cAre we delivering product at the time we say we're going to deliver it? Are we meeting that budget? And how well are we doing against that forecasted budget?\u201d Previously, the team spent a majority of their time building reports. It could take days to bring together up to 200 million lines of data from 100 different systems into a data warehouse to then build a portion of one usable dashboard. \u201cWe were using a Pinto for our data and we needed a Mercedes,\u201d says Kevin King, Director of Reporting and Analytics. Kevin recalls coming into the office at 7:30 in the morning, seven days a week to refresh the company\u2019s daily sales report, which took about 45 minutes. And the final dashboard had up to ten tabs that leadership had to click through to see any granularity in the data. When CCBCC adopted Tableau as its analytics platform, teams completely streamlined their processes. For the daily sales report, Kevin set up automatic refreshes in Tableau Server so data updates every day at 5:30 a.m. Leadership can access current numbers every morning, drill down to the lowest level of data, and Kevin and his team can spend their mornings on more productive tasks. The new enterprise-wide analytics strategy serves the needs of various audiences and roles. For example, leadership dashboards focus on strategy, business growth, and profitability. Management dashboards\u2014targeted to area sales managers, supervisors, etc.\u2014assist with coaching, training, and employee development. Managers can see high-level overviews of each area or drill down into employee-level data. Field sales dashboards allow sales teams to see a full overview of customer portfolios or track sales quotas. The entire business intelligence team spends less time on manual reporting and more time solving crucial problems and driving the business forward: \u201cIf I'm doing same thing over and over again, I'm never able to step out the box. Tableau allows us to step out of the box and look at data in a totally different way, which is really what we're here to do,\u201d says Kevin. \u201cFrom there, we can help them make decisions that drive profitability.\u201d Coca-Cola Bottling Company sells to grocery stores, pubs, all the way to big superstores like Walmart. With this breadth of buyers, Coca-Cola\u2019s leadership team aimed to bring mobile analytics to the field sales force via iPads. \u201cWe try to make sure our sales force is not stuck in the office, because we're primarily responsible for selling the product. And spending time in an office looking at metrics, crunching numbers is not their job. Their job is to sell product,\u201d shares Shawn Crenshaw, Senior Business Analyst. Previously it took up to a whole work day for a sales representative to find metrics around sales performance. With Tableau Mobile, the field sales team and Coca-Cola executives can access analytics in a few clicks. The business intelligence team now creates mobile versions of dashboards to optimize the user experience. \u201cEverything we've built has to be efficient enough so somebody can get to it in two clicks and they can make a decision right then and there. Tableau has provided us with the ability to not only provide accurate data, but to customize it for the user experience.\u201d Today, sales representatives can pull up the data anywhere and at any time when they\u2019re out in the field\u2014increasing agility to help sell more product. \u201c[Both] people in the field and our executives are out in the markets, they're out with customers. So if they have questions, instead of them having to pull up an Excel spreadsheet or pull up some kind of document, they go straight to their iPad, pull up a dashboard and answer the questions right then and there.\u201d When adopting Tableau as CCBCC\u2019s enterprise platform, the business intelligence team partnered with IT to create a scalable, long-term solution for self-service analytics. The business intelligence team worked with IT to ensure the proper governance was in place, while shifting day-to-day analytics tasks towards the business. \u201cWith this self-service concept, it's no longer an order-taker type of mentality [for IT]\u2026If you say, we\u2019re going to partner with you, the businessperson can do what they know how to do, and the IT person doesn't necessarily have to know the intricacies or the ins and outs of the business,\u201d says Bryan Franklin, Business Data Architect. \u201cThat sort of collaboration and being able to work together as a team\u2014I think that builds the relationship between IT and the business.\u201d The result was a faster analytics cycle, leading to more engagement from the business side. And with less day-to-day analytics tasks, IT can focus more on long-term data strategy and innovation."

Due to their integrated approach comprising subject matter expertise, professional project management, and transformation competency, speed and agility are increasingly important. Since May 2016, h&z uses Tableau to present data and insights to their customers in an interactive format. With Tableau, h&z can display large data volumes in a meaningful way. This is especially valuable when analyzing production and sales data along an entire supply chain. As experts in process management, h&z consultants manage large volumes of data for their customers\u2014including production and sales data along entire supply chains. Since every customer has its own data infrastructure, h&z required an analytics solution that could interface with a large variety of databases. h&z also needed to present data to their customers in an interactive manner. This would also allow consultants to answer questions at a moment\u2019s notice\u2014in meetings or on a call. Consultants needed a business analytics solution that delivered more efficiency and flexibility. For example, the ability to answer ad-hoc questions, which would take two weeks using Excel spreadsheets. To help lighten their workload and stay competitive, h&z realized that they needed to adopt a business intelligence solution. The company evaluated Tableau, Birst, and Qlik. According to Ulrich Bombka, Principal at h&z, the main reason Tableau came out on top was its ease of use: \u201cIt is the perfect tool for a decentralized self-service BI solution.\u201d After successfully working with the free trial version for 14 days, h&z provided a number of consultants and analysts with Tableau Desktop licenses. Ulrich explains, \u201cAfter a single introduction to using Tableau Desktop for all employees, our consultants and analysts were able to work with the software and create data visualizations.\u201d To increase their Tableau skills, employees use several training methods. Ulrich says, \u201cWhenever they have a question, they find their answers in the free Tableau training videos. And we are planning training sessions with Tableau Trainers, where analysts and consultants who frequently use Tableau will learn how to better use all its features and capabilities.\u201d With Tableau, h&z consultants can connect to several types of databases, depending on the client, says Bombka: \u201cYou can even visualize data from SAP Business Warehouse or CRM systems with very little training.\u201d \u201cWith Tableau we can connect to de-centralized databases and data files on-demand. That makes us faster and more flexible, which really is a decisive factor for the process oriented consulting we do at h&z.\u201d Where Tableau continues to shine is in customer presentations. h&z consultants display large data volumes in a meaningful way. \u201cWithin seconds we can drill down and filter by region, line of business, departments or time periods. It frees us from PDFs and PowerPoint and allows us to answer spontaneous questions on the spot,\u201d sums up Bombka."

        "content": "In the United States, when someone loses a limb, a whole network of doctors, prosthetics specialists, and physical therapists rush to help. Head just a few hundred miles south to Haiti, and it becomes an entirely different story. \u201c[For] somebody [with] a disability in Haiti, life is not easy. Most of them don\u2019t have help,\u201d says Haitian orthotics and prosthetics consultant Mahmadou Soul\u00e9. As he tells it, there is no way for those in need to get an artificial limb, which makes it even harder to earn a living in the poverty-stricken country. But Soul\u00e9 is not ready to abandon those in need. For him and his partners at Mobility Outreach International (MOi), helping someone walk means giving them a chance to live independently. Founded 27 years ago in the wake of the Vietnam War, MOi and local clinicians have helped more than 20,000 people in Vietnam, Haiti, Sierra Leone, and Bangladesh regain their ability to walk, work, and live a full life without limitation. When Carla Villoria joined MOi in 2014, her mandate was straightforward: analyze the organization\u2019s data and help the in-country program teams increase their success rate. Prosthetics, orthotics, and clubfoot treatment can require up to five years of consistent therapy and modification. But with so much of the record-keeping done on paper, very few clinicians had access to patient history and treatment schedules. \u201cMost of what we had was Excel sheets full of information that was pulled from paper forms once a month. It was riddled with errors and a painful process,\u201d says Carla. The treatment process is demanding and many patients often dropped out of the program, settling for a partial treatment or abandoning their prosthetics or clubfoot brace altogether. \u201cThe doctors were operating day to day, but the only patient history was their memory. They did not even have a clinic level overview of what was going on, much less the whole country,\u201d Carla says. There was a simple and immediate fix to the data problem: the smartphones in doctors\u2019 pockets. But getting the doctors to use the device to record the data posed a challenge. Here MOi saw an opportunity: If the organization could share the data with the doctors in a timely manner, doctors could stay more organized and provide a higher level of care. The organization started using Dimagi\u2019s CommCare app in 2015 to collect patient data by phone and track their progress. At the same time, the MOi team started prototyping and testing several Tableau dashboards that would inform both the individual clinics and the nationwide program. At first, many of the experienced physicians were dubious about the value. But as the MOi team demonstrated the prototypes and quickly incorporated their feedback, they bought in. Carla also got help automating reports and building visualizations from Tableau Service Corps volunteer Matt Coles and by October, 47 of MOi\u2019s partner clinics in Vietnam, Haiti, and Sierra Leone were on board. Doctors are now recording their patient information through CommCare. They\u2019re also using Tableau Cloud dashboards to manage their daily case load and track patient progress. They can get a holistic view of their clinic\u2019s performance, and compare their progress against clinics across the country. This data, when combined with geographic data, allows MOi to chart the improvement of success rates by region. For its part, the MOi program team can use the data to assess its work, improve effectiveness, and expanding outreach programs in lesser-served parts of the country. MOi\u2019s expects 100% of their partner clinics and prosthetics workshops in Vietnam, Haiti, and Sierra Leone, MOi to be on the system by mid-2016. \u201cThe response in Haiti has been particularly overwhelming. Clinicians are so excited about cutting down the paperwork burden,\u201d says Carla. She is also excited about MOi\u2019s track record of transferring these programs to the national Ministries of Health and seeing them thrive. \u201cWe want to be part of the current healthcare system, help these governments build/ rebuild that capacity, and bring mobility\u2014and a dignified life\u2014back to as many people as we can,\u201d says Carla."

With Tableau, ASKUL promotes a data-driven approach to these conversations, allowing leaders to tackle problems from several different angles. Yasukazu Watanabe says that after working with Tableau, he \u201ccan't imagine going back to working with pivot tables. Never.\u201d Tableau: How many people at ASKUL use Tableau? Yasukazu Watanabe, Analytics, EC Marketing Business Unit, BtoC Company, ASKUL Corporation: Tableau Desktop is used by about 20 people in the company, and also by approximately 100 people from partners working with us. About 60 people use Tableau Server. As regards the usage of Tableau Desktop and Server, Desktop is used for data analysis by the company and by analysts from partners. Since the Server is often used as a dashboard application, MD (merchandisers) and others are using it to track daily numerical data on the dashboard. Tableau: Why did you choose Tableau and how has it impacted your business? Yasukazu: Our company is carrying out \"EC Marketing Lab\" for partner manufacturers. For that lab, from the viewpoint of how to provide data* and how to show it clearly to the manufacturers, we examined several BI tools, and finally decided on Tableau. It might sound like flattery but now I can really see data from various angles, practically instantly. It is no longer necessary to spend time creating data-based graphs. I can take time to look at the data and do something with my findings, so I'm using my time more effectively. Tableau: Has there been any financial impact? Yasukazu: Well, it is difficult to say how much in terms of cost to be exact, but, manpower has been cut dramatically compared to creating data in Excel and making it into tables. Taking into consideration the saved manpower, and the fact that instead of spending time creating graphs I now have sufficient time to consider various factors and generate new information, I think the creation of new things itself is a valuable asset, as well as the reduction in cost. Tableau: Has Tableau changed how you approach data? Yasukazu: Looking at the data not only from one point of view but also on various axes can lead to new discoveries. When explaining things to other people, they want to see the information from various axes. Since Tableau makes it easy to do this, I feel that the listeners\u2019 understanding is also quick, which results in less time required. I can't imagine going back to working with pivot tables now. Never. *The data that Askul provides to the partner does not contain any personal information that can be used to identify a person.*"

For the past decade, the Zambian National Ministry of Health and the National Malaria Control Centre have used data to fight malaria\u2014saving thousands of lives. In 2014, PATH teamed up with the Tableau Foundation to launch Visualize No Malaria\u2014a campaign focused on integrating new tools and systems for data use to support Zambia\u2019s Ministry of Health in their effort to eliminate malaria. More than 75% of people who test positive for malaria report no symptoms. Analytics tools help field workers pinpoint malaria cases and forecast where they are likely to occur in the future. On the PATH blog, Jeff Bernson, Director of Results Management, Measurement, and Learning, noted, \u201cA key intervention for us is the data. To identify and treat every last case of malaria, we must be able to see accurate, reliable data that tracks emerging transmission patterns. Then we can target communities and catchment areas where the parasite is hiding.\u201d Health clinics and health facilities are the primary ways that Zambian communities access health care. But recently, the government of Zambia deployed community health workers who capture data across the country. All of the data is logged and reported into the District Health Information System. To help eliminate malaria in Zambia, Tableau is providing software, training, and support to empower frontline health workers with tools and resources. PATH uses Tableau Desktop to create dashboards and Tableau Server to communicate information across districts. Recently, PATH developed a Tableau dashboard that shows where workers collect data\u2014and whether or not the report is complete and accurate. PATH is also piloting \u201cVizAlerts,\u201d which track data collection in real time. If data are suspected to be inaccurate, it sends an automated SMS message back to the facility or the community health worker. The organization also uses mapping in Tableau to model catchment areas and shapes\u2014helping identify specific outbreak locations. \u201cWe also are doing a lot of entity extraction with the help of our Tableau volunteers to understand where these buildings are, and also understand their proximity to health facilities and also community health workers,\u201d says Jeff Bernson. This dashboard allows the National Ministry of Health to compare districts and facilities across the country. Jeff Bernson shared, \u201cIt\u2019s introducing a whole level of not just accountability but communication from the district level all the way down to that frontline user and the data collector. So, we're really excited about the potential opportunity.\u201d Data visualization allows local and national leaders to detect transmission patterns, as well as health system barriers, to see where to make investments and focus efforts. In a recent blog post, PATH explained, \u201cAs transmission rates get lower and lower, malaria cases become increasingly localized. The Tableau partnership will help us build the skills of district and facility health teams to combat the disease at the community level. Better visualization helps district health personnel glean the insights and generate the reports that make them more efficient at their jobs.\u201d Two years since the project started in the Southern Province, community health workers treated twice the amount of malaria cases during transmission season. And as rainy seasons came to a close in 2016, there wasn\u2019t the usual dramatic spike in malaria cases in southern Zambia. Jeff Bernson states, \u201cWith better surveillance and data, we can stamp out this disease.\u201d *PATH\u2019s work is supported in part by the Tableau Foundation."

Interactive, visual analytics enable DFID to accurately identify where to target aid and improve the coordination of humanitarian services, such as food, water, shelter, medicine, and education. By turning location data into interactive maps, DFID understands the latest crisis situation in any one of the 281 sub-districts of Syria. DFID analyzes information like age and gender of affected populations, number of healthcare cases, results of sanitation and hygiene activities, and availability of clean water sources. In turn, DFID helps meet the needs of vulnerable groups in Syria, including some in hard-to-reach areas and surrounding countries. In response to conflict in Syria, the UK Government committed \u00a32.3 billion ($3 billion) in aid since 2012, through The Department for International Development (DFID). DFID allocates funds to multiple implementation partners, including United Nations agencies and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), helping meet the immediate needs of vulnerable people in Syria and the surrounding regions, including Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, and Egypt. DFID relies on multiple partners working in Syria and elsewhere to explain the situation on the ground. Armed with this knowledge, DFID can determine the best course of aid action. One of the challenges was determining where best to allocate funds and resources: which partners need which resources, when, and where. Implementation partners share data from the field, on subjects as varied as location, demographic, and medical information. One specific example is data provided on geo-political issues, such as which territorial borders are open to safely channel aid, the control in each of the 281 sub-districts in Syria, and updates on the provision of education services. Gerson Bergeth, Information Manager at the DFID, explains, \u201cPartners provide the best picture they can, but it is limited to their area of visibility or expertise. So one NGO gives us rich datasets on children supported in formal and informal education, for example, while another gives us data on the number of food, water, or medicine packages distributed. Here in London, we need to turn this raw data into a complete, up-to-date picture of the humanitarian emergency.\u201d These reports are sent from the field to DFID as spreadsheets, PDFs, or local Access databases, and comprise thousands of rows of data. With so many reports to consolidate, the DFID had a hard time creating a holistic picture of relief efforts. For the DFID crisis response teams working in Whitehall, London it would take hours\u2014sometimes days\u2014to analyze the data and prepare presentations used for decision-making. Bergeth says, \u201cThe contracted reporting period is every quarter, so once you factor in the time needed to analyze the data, there is a risk that certain decisions are not based on the most recent data.\u201d Other questions were hard to answer. For example, much of DFID\u2019s Syrian aid work is affected by the status of the border crossing point, most notably between Syria and Turkey. If closed or restricted, affected populations may congregate at these points\u2014with potentially dangerous consequences. DFID needs to analyze the border status over previous months and monitor closures. That way the organization can coordinate the delivery of aid more effectively, \u201cComparing the situation month-on-month was very difficult using spreadsheets,\u201d says Bergeth. \u201cYou needed to be a serious \u2018techie\u2019 to build all the formulas. One error and the data was suddenly meaningless.\u201d In response to these data analysis challenges, DFID turned to Tableau as the state-of-the-art solution for information analysis and visualisation. Bergeth and his team use Tableau Desktop to create interactive visuals concerning aid provision. Data is blended from the disparate data sources provided by partners\u2014in just a few clicks. Bergeth again: \u201cThe speed we can visualize data is phenomenal. With Tableau, you don\u2019t need programming skills; you just drag and drop the sources you want to analyze. Then, once you have a visualization, you can switch instantly between views\u2014to a pie chart, a bar chart or plotter or whatever you choose.\u201d Three DFID users analyze in Tableau Desktop and share visualizations via Tableau Reader with up to 15 other users on the aid coordination teams in London. \u201cIt only took a day or two to learn how to use Tableau,\u201d says Bergeth. \u201cWe mainly taught ourselves using videos on the Tableau website, and if we had any questions, the Tableau forums were a fountain of knowledge and expert advice.\u201d The interactive visualizations enable DFID to pinpoint quickly and accurately where to target aid. Bergeth explains, \u201cWith Tableau it\u2019s apparent very quickly what the humanitarian crisis is, where it is happening, and what response we need to put in place.\u201d The situation on the Syrian border crossing points, for example, is visible now. Multiple Excel files are pulled into Tableau, giving the team in London a more complete view of individual circumstances. For example, whether a sub-district is within safe reach of implementing partners, the care taking place on the ground, and the status of refugees. Tableau\u2019s geocoding is transforming the way the DFID looks at data. In a few clicks, Bergeth and his team can zoom into a map of any one of the sub-districts of Syria and analyze a wide variety of scenarios. For example, age and gender of refugees, number of primary healthcare cases, return on investment for sanitation and hygiene programs, and accessibility of clean water sources. DFID can also incorporate third-party datasets to enrich their insights. For instance, weather data from publicly available meteorological sites helps DFID plan measures to provide more blankets, tents, or additional water supplies in extreme weather conditions. DFID is not only using Tableau to support the humanitarian emergency in Syria. In Turkey and Iraq, analysis of the registration of arriving Syrian refugees also enables the provision of basic humanitarian assistance including food, shelter, and relief packages. Using Tableau dashboards, the DFID helps improve the quality of education for early grade primary school children in Jordan. And in Lebanon, insights from the data help provide humanitarian assistance, strengthens the resilience of refugees in a sustainable way.

        "content": "With most processes already in the cloud, Tableau Cloud was a natural fit for AMAG Pharmaceuticals. Today, salespeople access dashboards in the field on smartphones and tablets\u2014and the data is available when they need it. AMAG\u2019s analytics team sets permissions, customizing each dashboard to fit the user\u2014from field representatives all the way to the C-Suite. Tableau: Why did you choose a cloud solution? Rachel Kell, Manager, Commercial and Decision Analytics: We have about four Tableau Desktop licenses, but our data is all in the cloud. We are completely on the cloud. We have an outsourced vendor that does our data warehouse, our ETL, and normalizing of the data. And they're all virtual. Our e-mail and our storage are all in the cloud as well, and then we use Tableau Cloud. The company was already completely virtual and they wanted to sort of fit the business platform within the paradigm of being on the cloud, but at the same time having sales reps that are traveling around with tablets instead of laptops it just sort of made sense. Tableau: How many people at AMAG use Tableau? Rachel: I think we have we have about 250 active Tableau Cloud licenses and they range from your average sales rep all the way to the CEO. They regularly check Tableau and get all of the data that they need and some of them have subscriptions sent to their e-mail. Tableau: How did people digest data before Tableau? Rachel: Before we deployed Tableau we would disseminate all the data via giant spreadsheets, which then each rep would have to customize to whatever particular like region or segment they wanted to look at because it would be everyone's data. And so that definitely saves them time and it prevents them from making any mistakes analyzing the data. Tableau: What have been some of the reactions from employees? Rachel: I think they're very excited, they're very grateful. They like that they can tell exactly how current the data is, have a field that says data current as of this date. And they love the fact that they can use the visualizations to make their lives a little easier. Tableau: How does Tableau Cloud help them do their jobs better? Rachel: They use it on their iPads, they use it to prepare for any call they're about to make on a healthcare provider to see what competitive products that provider is prescribing and the amounts and what they can use it to sort of focus what they're going to talk to the healthcare provider about during a given visit. It allows them an opportunity to figure out what sort of education the providers might need. So it helps clinical performance. It helps sales. Tableau: Has Tableau Cloud been scalable for AMAG? Rachel: It definitely seems very scalable. I think that for somebody in my role, being able to set groups of users is very helpful. You can just add a particular new sales rep to a group, and they automatically have access to a variety of dashboards for their specific needs, and I don't have to go do it manually one-by-one. So that's helpful in my job."

        "content": "The Extrabom chain started in 1978 with the opening of a small grocery store in Cariacica (ES). The retailer is currently among the 35 largest supermarket chains in Brazil. In a fiercely competitive industry, the retailer needed to increase analytics agility for faster decisions. With help from partner, QI ao Cubo, Extrabom deployed Tableau, shaving nearly a full day from analysis timelines. Today, executives and strategists at Extrabom use Tableau to streamline analysis and gain a global view of metrics like profit and losses. Tableau: How is Tableau particularly useful to your industry? Vitor Ventura, Technology Manager: Our industry is very competitive and works with very tight margins. Therefore, our operation must be highly optimized and we must always be aware of the loss and the profit margin. Tableau: How does Tableau benefit your company specifically? Vitor: With Tableau we have a better global view and a better perspective of the opportunities for improvement. This allowed us to contribute to the profitability of the business. Tableau: What is the impact that Tableau had on the company regarding insights? Have you saved time? Vitor: The main impact was that we improved and optimized the delivery of information. With Tableau, the delivery of reports is almost immediate. In a specific project, in the area of logistics, Tableau has benefited us greatly with the creation of management dashboards. With them, we have been able to improve the process and obtain a gain of 19% in logistics productive performance. Regarding the level of service, in supplying the stores, with Tableau dashboards we have managed to improve the indicator from 83% to 99.7% in ten months. Therefore, it is a tool that is already part of our day-to-day logistics. Tableau: How many people do you have creating and interacting with Tableau dashboards? Vitor: Today, Tableau services the company from end to end\u2014from management to operations. For example, in the case of the logistics department. In terms of consuming information in Tableau, we\u2019re talking about 200 users at the operations level. We have approximately 10 people creating these visual analyses. The level of detail we can reach analyzing data with Tableau is crucial to us today. Basically it would be impossible for us to operate business intelligence without Tableau Server. The volume of data is huge. We have analyses with almost five million rows. Another benefit is that it allows us to share information between areas with ease, providing better accessibility. Tableau: How did you get started with Tableau? Vitor: QI Cubed was critical to us throughout the whole process. They guided us, followed up on the process and assisted in the deployment of the tool and in exploring it more every day. Yes, QI Cubed, a Tableau partner in Espirito Santo, has worked closely with us in everything from the deployment of the tool up to the delivery of the more complex dashboards, visualizations and other projects. Moreover, in partnership with QI Cubed, we also worked to generate data sources so that users may use them. Tableau: Who is using Tableau within Extrabom? Vitor: We started to work with Tableau in the economic department of the company, in order to prepare the company for the economic scenario that was being sketched for 2015/2016. From then on the work evolved, and today we are working with Tableau in two other departments: market intelligence and logistics."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Founded in 1785, the University of Georgia hosts over 36,000 students in 17 different schools and colleges. The accounting department equips students with critical analytical skills before they enter the workforce. Professor of Accounting Information Systems, Margaret Christ discusses the importance of fostering data skills in the classroom to prepare students for their first jobs. Since analytics knowledge is a leading factor in hiring decisions at accounting firms, professors at UGA decided to incorporate hands-on Tableau trainings and use cases into the coursework. After incorporating the tool, professors have seen a new energy in accounting classes. Students eagerly engage with Tableau while gaining real-world experience for their future professions. Tableau: Why did you bring Tableau into your classroom? Margaret Christ, Professor, Accounting Information Systems: We've decided that we want all of our undergrad accounting students to have some exposure to data analytics before they go into their internships and into their jobs. Accounting firms have all told us that they really want the accounting students to have those skills when they start. In the last couple years, data analytics has become a really important initiative in most of the accounting firms. Most accounting students graduate with jobs and so we have a constant dialogue with the firms about what skill sets they really want their staff to have. Tableau: How do you use Tableau in the classroom? Margaret: In the last two years, we've really ramped up our analytics and we have started to incorporate hands-on Tableau training in class, and then a Tableau case. It's been really exciting. The students have really taken to it and have been kind of reenergized by the opportunity. Margaret: As accounting academics, we're all trying to make these cases as accessible as possible to each other just because we realize that everyone needs to be able to get their students up to speed with where the profession is going. And I think that shows them not only that data can really tell a story, but it also shows kind of the power that the person who's preparing it has, and how they need to understand what it is that they are communicating because it could be framed differently if they want to. Tableau: How has your experience been with Tableau? Margaret: My experiences with data visualization in the classroom so far have been so positive. The excitement and energy that the students are bringing to it is really wonderful. I feel like I'm really getting them the hands-on skills that they need. The employers are impressed, and I just can't wait to do even more next semester. You need to be able to think and make these decisions, and how to put the data together. And the opportunity to then be creative in how you present that data the most informative way is a really exciting experience for the students. Tableau: In your eyes, what is the value of data? Margaret: Data is really energizing the business school right now. I've been excited to be able to show my students that accounting is data, and they need to be able to analyze it. And so, that's been a really positive thing for our students. I think it's so important to understand what the data is telling you when you look at it\u2014but then it is also important how you communicate it to your client or your boss. And I think that shows that data can really tell a story, but it also shows the power of the person preparing the data."

Among them is management consultancy h&z, specializing in business excellence, procurement, production, sales, and service. Due to their integrated approach comprising subject-matter expertise, professional project management, and transformation competency, speed and agility are increasingly important. Since May 2016, h&z uses Tableau to present data and insights to their customers in an interactive format. With Tableau, h&z can display large data volumes in a meaningful way. This is especially valuable when analyzing production and sales data along an entire supply chain. As experts in process management, h&z consultants manage large volumes of data for their customers\u2014including supply chain, production, and sales data. Since every customer has its own data infrastructure, h&z required an analytics solution that could interface with a large variety of databases. h&z also needed to present data to their customers in an interactive manner. This would also allow consultants to answer questions at a moment\u2019s notice\u2014in meetings or on a call. Consultants needed a business analytics solution that delivered more efficiency and flexibility. For example, the ability to answer ad-hoc questions, which would take two weeks using Excel spreadsheets. To help lighten their workload and stay competitive, h&z realized that they needed to adopt a business intelligence solution. The company evaluated Tableau, Birst, and Qlik. According to Ulrich Bombka, Principal at h&z, the main reason Tableau came out on top was its ease of use: \u201cIt is the perfect tool for a decentralized self-service BI solution.\u201d After successfully working with the free trial version for 14 days, h&z provided a number of consultants and analysts with Tableau Desktop licenses. Ulrich explains, \u201cAfter a single introduction to using Tableau Desktop for all employees, our consultants and analysts were able to work with the software and create data visualizations.\u201d To increase their Tableau skills, employees use several training methods. Ulrich says, \u201cWhenever they have a question, they find their answers in the free Tableau training videos. And we are planning training sessions with Tableau Trainers, where analysts and consultants who frequently use Tableau will learn how to better use all its features and capabilities.\u201d With Tableau, h&z consultants can connect to several types of databases, depending on the client, says Bombka: \u201cYou can even visualize data from SAP Business Warehouse or CRM systems with very little training.\u201d \u201cWith Tableau we can connect to de-centralized databases and data files on-demand. That makes us faster and more flexible, which really is a decisive factor for the process oriented consulting we do at h&z.\u201d Where Tableau continues to shine is in customer presentations, where h&z consultants display large data volumes in interactive dashboards. \u201cWithin seconds we can drill down and filter by region, line of business, departments or time periods. It frees us from PDFs and PowerPoint and allows us to answer spontaneous questions on the spot,\u201dhe sums up."

The quality of its services has already been attested by numerous awards, national and international. In 2015, the company was elected \"Best low-cost airline in South America\" for the fifth consecutive time by Skytrax World Airline Awards. In the same year, Azul was also the most punctual low-cost airline in the world according to OAG. Initially, Azul started with seven Tableau Desktop licenses in the Fuel Efficiency department. Today, the company uses Tableau to analyze over 200 million records from their SQL Server database. Four departments use Tableau, with plans to expand access across all pilots along with other company areas. For governance, administrators use Active Directory so the data stays secure. Daniel Galizi, Data Analytics, BI and DW, concludes, \u201cTableau enables us to decide, assemble and put everything into production very quickly.\u201d Tableau: What encouraged Azul to try Tableau? Daniel Galizi, Data Analyst and Fuel Efficiency Coordinator: This is how our story with Tableau began. We needed something fast which yielded immediate results. It was then that Tableau came to our help with its agility, immediate results, and usability. Tableau: What is the size of the data you work with today? Daniel: We started with Tableau from scratch, with Desktop licenses, a desktop computer, and Excel. Then we moved to SQL Server. This was very good because we had the time to identify our needs, understand them, scale them, and most importantly, create a culture of data in our department. And that was very important. Today, we work with around 200 million records and use SQL Server at the data center. But I always say that it is possible to start from scratch with almost no investment. Tableau: How did you begin to implement Tableau? Daniel: In the beginning, we were using Tableau because of our partner. From then on, we started using the tool to work on our own analyses. We had only three people in the team and I was responsible for the data and the visual parts of Tableau. Then, other related areas of our company began to see what we were doing and grew interested, so we expanded Tableau gradually to these other areas. Tableau: Approximately, how many departments are using Tableau today? Daniel: Today, Tableau is used by four departments: our executives, of course; maintenance, operational control and the board of pilots. But we have plans to expand its use to other areas, and make it available for all flight crew members in the company. Tableau: Can you tell us a little about the impact of Tableau at your company? Daniel: Before Tableau, our meetings were very sluggish. We ended up arguing over how to do things rather than what to actually do. And most of the time, the meeting would end without any results. The acceleration that Tableau brought to this process was immediate. Today, now that we have already created a culture with Tableau, we enter a meeting and everything is very dynamic, very interactive. We have already been able to change a filter, add a new variable, and in most cases, we leave the meeting with the results we need within minutes. The time saved is impressive, both in the visuals and data parts. Normally, when we prepare a database, we work a little bit on Tableau to be able to see the data in a different way, to view them and build basic statistics. Then we set out to solve the issue. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted your day to day work? Daniel: Tableau enables us to decide, assemble, and put into production everything very quickly. And this is important, because in aviation things change all the time. With Tableau, we track these changes, being on top of everything. Tableau: And if you didn\u2019t have Tableau, what would happen? Daniel: We would continue working, of course, but I would say that it would happen in a less productive way. We would be working with our spreadsheets, with very limited charts, without any interaction, and without the differential offered by Tableau. Tableau: What would you say to someone who is considering using Tableau? Daniel: Just get started, that is the secret. Once you begin, you will feel the power you have in your hands, and you will have the freedom to make lots of mistakes too, and fixes and adjustments as well. Tableau is very easy to use, and the learning curve is also very good. Tableau: What are Azul\u2019s future plans for Tableau? Daniel: We plan to expand Tableau to the crew so that they have access to all the charts. We're talking about 1,000 people initially. Other plans include extending the functionality through APIs and mobile devices (iPads, iPhones), especially for executives to attend meetings remotely. Tableau: How has Tableau Server helped you govern your data? Daniel: Our experience with Tableau Server started very well. Being able to publish the data sources for the departments makes things much easier. With the expertise we already have, we moved from consumers to data providers. In addition, the possibility to create specific sites for certain areas, with easy management, allows us to have control over the features and the users in a very simple way \u2013 and everything is integrated with Active Directory, which is critical for us. It is even a matter of security for the company."

        "content": "The University of Notre Dame provides a unique academic environment for more than 10,000 undergraduate, professional, and graduate students. Today, the university accesses data through DataND\u2014a campus-wide portal. With DataND, built on Tableau Server, employees access governed data and standardized definitions\u2014securing one source of truth across the university. Offices also have the option to download workbooks. With Tableau Desktop, they can bring in relevant data sources to expand their analysis and answer ad-hoc questions. Reporting that used to take two months now only takes a couple of days. Due to growing data, Notre Dame\u2019s fundraising office adopted Snowflake Elastic Data Warehouse, built for the cloud. With Snowflake\u2019s virtual data warehouses, they instantly match capacity with need\u2014and in many cases, their analysis is 10x faster. Tableau users can take advantage of that speed with direct connectivity for both dashboard creation and viewing. With Tableau and Snowflake, Notre Dame has a platform that is scalable, fast, and accessible. Previously, Notre Dame struggled with disparate data, spread across the university. Departments had a difficult time getting data out of the enterprise data warehouse. Even when they succeeded in accessing the data, they struggled to interpret it. Standard reports took about two months to create. \u201cWe knew the data existed, but we were struggling to get to it,\u201d said Chris Frederick, Business Intelligence Manager, Notre Dame. Each department worked in silos with their own data definitions, leading to inconsistent reporting across campus. If a decision maker had a question like, \u201cHow many students do we have?\u201d each department had a different answer based on a small subset of data. Understanding alumni interaction trends and finding new ways to keep alumni connected are crucial to Notre Dame. The university built its first data warehouse with a legacy warehouse vendor eight years ago. But the system couldn\u2019t scale to Notre Dame\u2019s thriving volume and velocity of data\u2014a result of new, faster fundraising efforts. Queries could often take 30-90 minutes to complete. \u201cWe decided to look into new solutions that could help improve overall performance,\u201d said Frederick. To keep pace with growing business demands, Notre Dame needed a flexible, scalable, and user-friendly data warehouse and a business intelligence (BI) platform that could keep pace with big data. Faster query performance and support for both concurrency and scalability were top priorities, along with reduced maintenance and overhead. Notre Dame first introduced Tableau within the Office of Strategic Planning and Institutional Research, where staff immediately enjoyed the software\u2019s interactivity. The BI department observed their success and evaluated Tableau as an option to replace their existing data portal. To increase data access, the BI team created DataND\u2014a governed, campus-wide data portal. The team embeds Tableau Server into the portal to offer an interactive, user-friendly data experience. \u201cThe goal for DataND was to share information more broadly with campus and to make it as easily accessible as possible,\u201d says Frederick. DataND features approved dashboards that help answer common questions. Employees download workbooks to bring into Tableau Desktop, blending with their own data sources to customize their analysis. In addition to DataND, each office has its own Tableau Server site for employees to share adapted workbooks and collaborate. In response to the fundraising office\u2019s growing data needs, the department adopted Snowflake\u2019s Elastic Data Warehouse, built for the cloud. The team connects directly to Snowflake with Tableau Desktop to understand trends and help the university better structure fundraising efforts. Shared dashboards and reports also leverage direct connectivity to Snowflake, allowing end users to benefit from performance gains as well. With DataND built on Tableau Server, Notre Dame created a single source of truth for data access and definitions. Offices can find quick answers with pre-built dashboards or download workbooks to further explore the data. With Tableau, the BI team reduced cost and increased efficiency, with deeper analysis and less development effort. \u201cDataND allows us to spend less time on finding and extracting data and more time on analyzing and understanding its implications,\u201d says Evan Grantham-Brown, Business Intelligence Professional, Notre Dame. DataND provides governed access to the enterprise data warehouse, leading to faster, more accurate reporting. Frederick commented, \u201cPreviously, it took us about two months to build a report. Now, with Tableau, we can put a report on DataND in just a couple of days. And so that difference in time is dramatic.\u201d While its old data warehouse and analytics lacked the ability to quickly process and analyze semi-structured data, such as social media activity, Snowflake can natively understand and optimize transform both structured and semi-structured data. Today, Notre Dame can load any data into Snowflake without a predefined schema, and query it using ANSI-standard SQL. \u201cTableau is the friendliest way for our business to explore data. When you're lost in a sea of data, a visualization can act as a sort of information map,\u201d Frederick said. \"When combined with Snowflake's speed, we can now explore this information map at the speed of thought and move from data to information to a decision 10 times faster.\u201d With a click of a button, Notre Dame can now immediately scale up its warehouses and storage, or even create new warehouses, with no need for adding capacity and backup systems. And in Tableau, the team can connect to any Snowflake warehouse to prepare dashboards in minutes. Now, with more rapid run times and visual analysis in Tableau, analysts and campus leaders make faster decisions. End users don\u2019t have to devote nights and weekends to generating reports. Additionally, Notre Dame\u2019s offices can ask additional questions to fully understand their data and make informed, data-driven decisions.

With Tableau, analysts can now access data more efficiently, and in turn, drive their effect on the business. Tableau: Can you tell me a little bit about your internal user groups? Diane Kakareka, Advanced Analytics Manager, Hallmark Cards: We have built a user group that has right now five main training sessions and they're two weeks apart. So it's a constant drumbeat of Tableau. The need came about because we have had an influx of users. Tableau: What benefits have you seen with the internal user groups? Alexs Thompson, Data Scientist, Hallmark Cards: The internal user group became really crucial for us to drive new ways of looking at data and ensuring that our analysts had all the skills they needed to go to the maximum ability with Tableau. So it was a great way for us to really ensure that Tableau was being used to drive the business in the way we believe it can be. Tableau: What reactions have you seen from your employees? Alexs: The outcome of our internal user group has been to actually\u2014not just on paper, but to actually build a group of people who are working together, collaborating, sharing their skills and just sort of pushing each other forward. So it's been really exciting. Diane: There is more of a community now. Often, what people will do is they'll use our Lync or Instant Messenger capability to say, \"Hey, you got a minute? I have this question in Tableau.\" Or if people kind of sit near each other, they might pop up and say, you know, \"Hey, I have a question, do you know how to do this in Tableau?\" Tableau: How has Tableau impacted your company? Alexs: Tableau has changed the way that analysts learn their craft because it starts off as a conversation about Tableau, but then it's like, well, wait, what is a waterfall chart, or what is this that I'm doing in Tableau\u2014and is there a better way to do it? Working with Tableau gives analysts more access to data, and it just changes the way that they think about the business and how they do their job."

So we were looking for a tool that matches our company culture of going fast, bring awesome looks to our data, because that completely matches the new world \u2013 if you look at Uber, if you look at Airbnb, look and feel was very important. And we were looking for the best tool at the market. Tableau: What is the outlook for the future?\nKenneth Claeyssens: We have linked Tableau to one certain data warehouse, our data warehouse for Ploy. But now, we can also use it on top of other databases. For example, I work in the finance department. I have a lot of Excel sheets full of data. And now, I can just put Tableau on the top of those datasheets and do visualizations myself."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Conduent, formerly known as Xerox Services, started with a few Tableau Desktop licenses. As more people saw the value in their data, the IT team scaled Tableau Server across the company. Today, the company uses Tableau in several departments including human resources, sales, and finance. In the first video, James Baker, Commercial Operations at Conduent, shares insights on his operation\u2019s successful partnership with IT. In the second video, James describes the slow business processes his analysts faced before Tableau. Every department was doing something different, leading to delays of \u201cdays, if not weeks.\u201d Today, senior leadership has instant access to data, which James calls \u201ca complete sea change.\u201d Tableau: Why did you initially look into Tableau? James Baker, Commercial Operations, Conduent: We had senior sponsorship saying that we really needed to do something different and approached it. We had a fantastic tool that we'd chosen in Tableau. So we changed our approach a couple of months into the deployment. And we got much more interactive and we kind of went back to the basics of what Tableau is about, which is making people really interact with their data at that business level. Tableau: What was your team\u2019s reaction to Tableau? James: Suddenly, you'd see these people's eyes light up because what we were doing was suddenly more meaningful for them. It wasn't just rolling out a new bit of technology. Suddenly they could see how this was going to help them do something that they'd not been able to do very quickly before. So that was a real sea change for us. Tableau: Can you give an example? James: So, someone said, \"I've got a problem last month with this particular account. I had a cost issue, how can you help me with that?\" And we'd literally just focus in on that account. We'd use just our published dashboards to really interrogate what was going on. Tableau: How did business partner with the IT department? James: We were lucky in that there were two parties driving the project. They had our IT organization who owned the platform or the IT operations, the infrastructure you might call it. And then me as the business leader driving what we wanted to deliver for the business. So we had really two equal parties in this. On the IT side, those guys were responsible for building out our connections to our data, building out ETL layers, making sure that we've got good solid automation. They're responsible for all Server admin and making sure the lights stay on and the server's up and running all the time that we need it. Generally I think we've had an excellent working relationship with our IT organization. They've been really good partners in the way that we've deployed this. Tableau: Has your team seen measurable improvements as a result? James: I don't think we'd have been able to be anywhere near as successful as we have been from a business side of it without those guys being fully on board and being really supportive of making sure that this is a success for us. Tableau: How do you handle authentication? James Baker: So we manage authentication within Tableau, but we've got a corporate authentication solution using SAML so we've basically integrated that standard API for that that most applications can leverage. Tableau: Can you describe how you organize groups with individually assigned access? James: Again, the IT organization built the integration for that. So every new person that wants to have access to server, they can authenticate using their S3 credentials. We then just very simply use groups\u2014which is dependent on our business unit, each business unit, each person is then assigned to a group. Tableau: What were your requirements for a BI solution? James: We wanted something that was really flexible, adaptable, something that we could work really quickly with and drive out into the business quickly and simply. Some of the key problems that we identified before we looked at deploying Tableau were lots of bottlenecks in acquiring data. People didn't have access to the information they needed quickly and efficiently. Tableau: Before Tableau, how long was the reporting process? James: We often had delays of days, if not weeks, before people would get reports. We had lots of BI solutions, but were never really using them effectively. We had pockets: one in supply chain, one in operations, one in sales, everyone doing something slightly different. Tableau: How did Tableau fit into your workflow? James: We just felt that Tableau was kind of an ideal match for what we were trying to do. We're starting to explore new data, HR data for example, and we're just now starting to build out what our dashboards might want to look like; we're bringing in some of our HR people, some of our operations people and saying, \"how would you want to see this?\" Tableau: What benefits have you experienced? James: We're now pulling data daily into Tableau and making that available 24/7 to all our senior leadership team so that they can look at that information as soon as it's available and as soon as they need it\u2014a complete sea change to what we were doing before. We're spending an awful lot of our time actually coaching our people to think differently. It's trying to enable more of a culture of analytics as opposed to a culture of reading data tables."

        "company": "Örum",
        "content": "\u00d6rum adopted Tableau as part of a new analytics strategy, spearheaded by the IT personnel department and championed by the Chief Information Officer, Juho Luukko and CEO, Lars Husberg. Today, \u00d6rum uses Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server to share, distribute, and collaborate on the data that had been hidden away for so long. Reports that previously took weeks\u2014sometimes months\u2014to develop are now ready in minutes. \u00d6rum now has a governed, complete view of key sales metrics, allowing the company to be more responsive to sales opportunities, cross-sell complementary automotive spares, and ultimately grow revenue. The role of IT has also changed. With this time savings, the team can focus more on strategic projects\u2014enabling the business to be successful. \u00d6rum Oy AB is one of Finland\u2019s leading automotive parts distributors. Founded in 1902 and with a turnover of \u20ac 68 million ($78 million), the company provides vehicle owners, repair shops, and automotive dealerships with automotive spare parts and accessories for almost any model of vehicle. For many years, \u00d6rum used a legacy enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to source data for sales, finance, and other departments. However that model was broken: the reports that emerged from the ERP system were either unreliable, outdated, incomplete\u2014or sometimes all three. \u201cUntil a few years ago, reporting was a mess,\u201d says Juho Luukko, Chief Information Officer, \u00d6rum. \u201cWe simply couldn\u2019t trust the data we were looking at. The ERP system was so inflexible that data extraction took time, money, and resources.\u201d The company struggled to analyze sales, profit, and customer satisfaction. For example, it was difficult to determine underselling parts or the most lucrative garages. Luukko explains, \u201cEven when we did pull the analysis together, the reports were often out-of-date by the time they reached the desks of our executives.\u201d Reporting was also inconsistent. He continues, \u201cThe monthly report was prepared by one individual, and then the following month by someone else using different parameters\u2014which meant we couldn\u2019t explore trends or patterns. In the case of sales, it was extremely difficult to forecast the difference from one month to the next. We didn\u2019t know what we were measuring.\u201d \u00d6rum\u2019s IT department spearheaded the search for a new business intelligence (BI) solution. Chief Information Officer, Luukko first looked to Gartner for guidance. Positioned as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms Report, Tableau offered \u00d6rum the opportunity to quickly visualize and understand data. Luukko comments, \u201cOur Tableau strategy is driven by IT and developed by the business. It\u2019s the people in IT who are recommending this business-driven solution. By encouraging business users to analyze the data themselves, we are helping to evolve the IT department into being a business enabler.\u201d During the vetting process, both Luukko and \u00d6rum CEO, Lars Husberg, trialed Tableau, starting with sales dashboards. Luukko recalls, \u201cWithin less than two hours with Tableau, I had created this really impressive sales report. I was able to drill-down into the data, pull together multiple views, and analyze an up-to-date picture of our sales situation. It would have taken us months to produce this type of report using our old KPI-driven data warehouse processes. I was immediately hooked.\u201d \u00d6rum worked closely with local Tableau partner, Solutive to deploy a Tableau Desktop and Server solution, distributing licenses across sales, marketing, and finance departments. With Tableau Server, users can share their findings and collaborate across teams. In Tableau, \u00d6rum connects to data from Google BigQuery and other sources. And with Tableau\u2019s ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), they can bring in data from their ERP system, Microsoft Dynamics AX. Solutive continues to support \u00d6rum with server setup, training, local support, and also some workbook creation. \u201cSolutive are experts. They recommended Google BigQuery and the cloud-based analytics platform is ideal for our data. It integrates seamlessly with Tableau and there\u2019s no performance impact on our systems.\u201d So what\u2019s the impact? Since adopting Tableau, \u00d6rum significantly increased reporting speeds. In the past it took weeks\u2014sometimes months\u2014to prepare a report which answered just one question. Now answers are available in minutes. And business users have the flexibility to interrogate the data and answer follow-up questions. Take \u00d6rum\u2019s sales team for example, who visit garages and automotive dealerships throughout Finland to support customer relationships. With Tableau Server, they can view a snapshot of the sales situation. Before their visit, they can quickly understand which automotive parts are selling in what quantities at particular garages; which customers order the most spare parts, which products have been returned for being defective, and much more. This enables the company to be more responsive to sales opportunities, cross-sell complementary automotive spares, and ultimately grow revenues. Staff are also more creative in their decision-making. They can drill down into the data and pose \u2018what if?' questions, or immediately see the outcome of particular actions. For example, the team that manages inventory at the \u00d6rum parts warehouse can see the value of stock, what is selling, where parts are shipped, and the margin on those items. This leads to more efficient inventory management and lower cost. Due to \u00d6rum\u2019s new self-service approach to data, the IT team reassigned several resources to other high-priority projects. \u201cReporting used to be an IT problem. Our department was generally perceived as being the barrier to the business, because the reports took so long to produce. Now, thanks to Tableau, the business is responsible for daily reporting tasks\u2014and they love it.\" Luukko still loves asking questions with Tableau. \u201cI was having so much fun using Tableau to answer questions about the business that my wife said to me one evening, \u2018It\u2019s either Tableau or me; you need to choose!\u2019,\u201d he says with a laugh."

With Tableau and Alteryx, the team analyzes data in hours instead of months\u2014helping the business make crucial decisions around liquidations and sales. Since adopting Tableau, Preetham Shanbhag, Senior Director, FP&A Operations and Transformation, estimates that Honeywell saved 10,000-20,000 man hours. When it comes to business value, Preetham said, \u201cYou cannot really put a price on it.\u201d Honeywell\u2019s Global Finance Center supports analytics for 14 strategic business units and product lines across 100+ countries. Their internal customer group spans across general management, sales, marketing, procurement, IT, human resources, and more. Powered by Tableau and Alteryx, the team analyzes data from over 150 ERP systems, including SAP, Oracle, Navision, and JD Edwards, to name a few. Since March of 2016, Honeywell scaled from zero to 9,000 Tableau users across the company. Preetham Shanbhag, Senior Director, FP&A Operations and Transformation, explained, \u201cIn the finance domain, you analyze tons and tons of data. I mean, you have your P&Ls (profit and losses), your sales, orders backlog, working capital, cash flow. There's a ton of transactional data to analyze.\u201d The Global Finance Center previously analyzed data with Excel and a combination of other tools, which could take months of extraction, manipulation, and transformation. For example, standard sales reporting used to take up to three or four months to produce. When the team adopted Tableau, they created the same reports in hours or less. \u201cI can tell you that easily it runs into 10,000-20,000 man hours in terms of productivity generated because of the automation, standardization you get out of Tableau.\u201d \u201cBut more than that, it\u2019s the business value, and you cannot really put a price on it,\u201d said Preetham. \u201cEarlier we spent 70% of the time on data extraction and all the drudge-work, 30% on analytics. Now that's just the opposite, which means it\u2019s a direct P&L impact in terms of the business decisions that you can drive.\u201d Inventory reports built in Tableau help the business make more informed decisions around \u201cwhen [they] should liquidate versus fire sale\u201d explained Preetham. When it comes to business value, he says, \u201cyou cannot really put a price on it.\u201d The team also leads project around working capital analytics and reducing indirect spend, travel and expense costs, and freight costs\u2014providing a holistic view of company spending. Additionally, Tableau dashboards focused on revenue by segments and product clients help leadership make decisions around where to deploy their sales force. Preetham continues, \u201cYou can take all of that data, translate it into good business insights, and then work with your internal customer group to enable them make good decisions based on those insights. That\u2019s how I see Tableau enabling that value chain.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the ease of use; it\u2019s the intuitiveness that will make a difference, and how customers perceive your product. So for us as a financial planning and analysis organization it's about how our reports can be made easier to read, how quickly the internal customer can make a decision out of it.\u201d"

        "content": "Today, PAREXEL embeds Tableau Server into their Perceptive MyTrials Analytics\u00ae product, helping customers access data from clinical trials. PAREXEL also uses Tableau internally to drive the business. With Tableau and MyTrials Analytics, customers access industry-leading dashboards that display the entire performance of their clinical trial. Additionally, they can ask questions of their data and quickly spot outliers. Software Engineering Manager, Richard Pearson explains how Tableau integrates with PAREXEL\u2019s single sign-on capability, allowing customers to move from one PAREXEL product to another without interruption\u2014and most importantly, keeping data secure. Tableau: Can you share a bit about PAREXEL? Richard Pearson, Software Engineering Manager: PAREXEL is a provider of solutions to the clinical trial industry. We will provide technological solutions to pharmaceutical companies who want to run clinical trials as well as actually running the clinical trials on behalf of a client. We had a very clear vision of where we wanted to go with our business intelligence strategy, and with Tableau we found a partner innovative enough to match our ambition. Tableau: Why did you choose Tableau instead of building your own BI solution? Richard: The pure power and capabilities of Tableau really meant that we didn't need to invest in building our own analytics solution, but rather we could build around Tableau and leverage the power of Tableau and use our OEM partnership with Tableau to help us move forward in that industry. Tableau: What data do you present to customers in MyTrials Analytics? Richard: With Tableau and MyTrials Analytics, we're able to show the customer the entire performance of their clinical trial and even their entire portfolio of clinical trials\u2014combining the data from multiple clinical trials in one visualization. This allows the customer to immediately see where there are any outliers. We want to be able to spot problems before they become problems. For example, we can see the history of a patient's visit schedule. We might know that by average, this patient will probably be one or two days late for a visit. We try and flag that earlier so that the clinical team can make sure that there's medication on site. If the medication's going to expire, they can make sure that they have the right medication in transit\u2014so by the time the patient arrives, there won't be any problems. Tableau: How do you handle authentication? Richard: We sync Tableau with our own single sign-on (SSO) capability, which means that if a customer's coming from one product to another product, or any other system, they don't have to login twice. They navigate seamlessly from their application into their visualizations. And regardless of the application that they're coming from, they're able to see data from all of the different systems that they have with PAREXEL. So, when the user logs into the dashboard, even though it's one dashboard, it's customized for that particular user, both in terms of security and the type of data that they're seeing, the terminology used in the dashboard. Tableau: Has Tableau been a successful partner? Richard: I would say that some of the great value that Tableau is adding is just simply their relentless pace of innovation, and the new features that they're bringing in are matching almost perfectly with our own roadmap. You see something interesting, you click on it and suddenly that data expands and you see a different visualization and you keep navigating through your data. And eventually, you know, you find what it is you're after. It lets people become experts in understanding their data immediately without really any prior training or knowledge. Tableau: What impressed you most about Tableau? Richard: The speed with which we can build those visualizations gives us a powerful capacity to react quickly to customer and business needs. And the power of that data engine behind Tableau lets us work with tremendous volumes of data without there being any negative impact on the performance of those visualizations. Tableau: How has Tableau changed your approach to analytics? Richard: It's sparked a passion in me for analytics and business intelligence, and visualizations that I never knew I had."

        "company": "werliefertwas - wlw",
        "content": "\u201cwer liefert was\u201d is the leading B2B market place for Germany, Austria and Switzerland with roughly 1.3 million visitors per month. Offering access to around 540,000 manufacturers, traders, service providers and suppliers with millions of products, goods and services in the B2B segment, wlw is the most visited German-language internet platform for professional purchasers. The company wanted to restructure its entire business intelligence architecture in order to be able to react more quickly and flexibly. One part of the puzzle was automated reporting that would save time, eliminate errors, and create the freedom for more innovative, advanced analytics. After evaluating a number of alternatives, wlw decided to deploy Tableau because it combined advanced analytics with ease of use. With Tableau, wlw automates reports and eliminates recurring manual reporting tasks. Employees access updated dashboards through Tableau Server. As a result, wlw saves roughly 8 person days per month and has created the prerequisites for data-based decision making. Their long-term goal is to deploy self-service reporting throughout the entire organization. Each Monday, one employee in controlling created a report about the current incoming orders for the weekly management meeting. This required the support of the business intelligence (BI) team. They extracted necessary information from wlw\u2019s Oracle data warehouse using SQL statements, manually processed the data in Excel and PowerPoint, and finally emailed out PDFs to an extended circle of recipients including executives. \u201cEach time we created this multi-page report\u2014mainly containing tables and time series\u2014it took us half a person-day, and because of all the copy & paste going on between different tools, it was very error prone,\u201d explains Leif Hitzschke, Head of Business Intelligence at wlw. It was also difficult to find current sales figures outside of the weekly internal report. The BI team had to manually process additional ad-hoc report requests from individual departments, which led to a reporting queue. These reports included information about internet traffic, international operations, customer churn, product search metrics, and key performance indicators (KPIs) for promotional activities. In addition, different departments had divergent definitions of some of the same KPIs, which could lead to misunderstandings. \u201cFor a highly digitalized business such as wlw, the reporting architecture simply wasn\u2019t up to par anymore,\u201d says Hitzschke. \u201cSo we were looking for a solution that would automate our process, while at the same time making it faster and independent of any individual person. We also wanted to provide self-service to our departments, so they could answer any further questions independently from the BI team.\u201d wlw went looking for a business intelligence solution. They evaluated a number of established products in the market, including SAP Business Objects and MicroStrategy. \u201cIt was essential for us to find a solution that offered the functionality we needed on the one hand, but would also allow us to run it in-house without external support staff,\u201d explains Leif Hitzschke. \u201cSo we tested various products in our everyday work.\u201d In the end, wlw purchased several Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server licenses. The BI team uses Tableau Desktop to create standard reports and answer ad-hoc questions. They share results with executives as well as colleagues from sales, marketing, finance, and IT departments\u2014all over Tableau Server. To ensure high efficiency right from the start, wlw secured the support of Tableau partner, The Information Lab, based in Hamburg. The Information Lab provided basic training for the BI team and helped create the first wlw dashboards. \u201cIt only took 5 consultancy days, which shows how well the system matches our needs. It also speaks volumes about the expert services rendered by The Information Lab\u201c, says Leif Hitzschke. \u201cPlus, the Tableau partner offers quick support whenever we need it through a flexible online ticket system.\u201d After connecting all relevant data sources and transforming tables into interactive visualizations, wlw recreated the original order report as a dashboard. On the back end, wlw uses Data Vault, a modelling method and process for building data models. Today, the report just takes a quick sanity check from a controller before managers access it directly via Tableau Server. Leadership can now discuss current numbers in their weekly results review, and drill down into outliers as they appear. Current data is available at any time, giving executives time to prepare and answer their own questions ahead of board meetings. \u201cWith Tableau, we have found a solution that completely fulfills our requirements,\u201d says Leif Hitzschke. \u201cIt\u2019s all very intuitive and easy to use. We even managed to set up our own Tableau Server without external help.\u201d Today with Tableau, wlw saves roughly four working hours per weekly report. In addition, controllers perform quality assurance on the data, meaning reports are more accurate than previous PDFs. At first, the old reports were run in parallel with Tableau. When switching off the old reporting, wlw eliminated the manual effort. Because Tableau allows the report to be generated at the push of a button, any member of the BI team can now handle report creation. The company is also expecting significant advantages from simplified ad-hoc querying. \u201cMany employees have no experience with database queries whatsoever,\u201d says Leif Hitzschke. \u201cFor them it is still very difficult to quickly find answers to their very specific questions in the available data. With Tableau we have made a first step towards self-service BI for them by providing generic dashboards. Simpler processes also mean good things for the business intelligence team. With faster, automated reporting, the team has more time to focus on strategic projects that benefit the whole company. By using Tableau Server, wlw has unified their entire report architecture and was able to significantly improve data quality. \u201cWith Tableau we\u2019ve successfully created a single source of truth for the sales department,\u201c Hitzschke reports. \u201cGoing forward we will continue our journey and add other areas, such as web traffic analysis.\u201d wlw also plans to extend its self-service and introduce the individual departments to Tableau, enabling them to generate their own reports. At the same time, a governance initiative running in parallel has already markedly improved data quality. Leif Hitzschke sums up his long term goal for the company\u2019s data journey: \u201cWe are currently expanding our Advanced Analytics and we want to develop our reporting towards mobile BI.\u201d"

        "content": "In 2014, West Africa fell victim to what would become the largest Ebola outbreak in disease history, with more cases and deaths reported than all of the previous outbreaks combined. In an attempt to contain the contagion, field workers in Africa began retracing human contacts of known patients. When people are identified soon after exposure, they can be monitored for symptoms during Ebola\u2019s 21-day incubation period. As a result, the odds of preventing further spread vastly improve. But how do we contain the entire epidemic? The information needed to respond to Ebola must spread faster than the disease itself, say our partners at Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute. \u201cThe way information is collected and shared is fragmented and terribly inefficient,\u201d said Anne Liu, the Earth Institute\u2019s associate director for health systems development. In order to interrupt Ebola\u2019s chains of transmission, workers must be able to share critical data almost instantly. Fast access is mission-critical. Understanding this sense of urgency, Dimagi, a Massachusetts-based private social enterprise, brought its CommCare informatics system to West Africa. The mobile data-collection platform works both in real-time and offline\u2014a vital function in a region with fragile networks and unreliable connectivity. To enable fast data sharing, we stepped in with a grant to deploy Tableau Server and Desktop along with training help. Tableau Visionaries quickly created dashboards to help field workers track and monitor transmissions. Empowered with Tableau, Dimagi is gaining ground in the fight against Ebola. Ericsson, another Dimagi partner on the project, provided smartphones loaded with the CommCare software to contact tracers in the field. The Earth Institute and Partners in Health also pitched in to help. The resulting insights quickly proved valuable to officials on the ground. Guinean health ministers began consulting Tableau dashboards when deciding where to direct resources. \u201cVisualization creates a hook for demonstrating the value and power of the information we are collecting,\u201d said Jonathan Jackson, founder and CEO of Dimagi. \u201cIf no one looks at the data we are collecting, then we can\u2019t learn from it and nothing gets done differently.\u201d"

This new perspective has allowed EOS to embrace a more targeted approach. \u201cThe impact was dramatic. That\u2019s why we feel good about completely redoing the way we do analytics,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cEvery school is really unique. Our standard analysis didn\u2019t always fit.\u201d EOS has added survey data to identify each school\u2019s needs beyond test scores, including what Hadley calls \u201cacademic tenacity characteristics\u201d\u2014things like grit and a sense of belonging. \"This is going to help EOS and analytics to the next level,\u201d Hadley said."

        "content": "Steven John, CIO of AmeriPride, one of the largest uniform rental and linen supply companies in North America, chose Tableau to empower business users with data. As the basis of his decision, Steven cites Tableau\u2019s product roadmap and ability to snap in with a brand new data stack including HP Vertica and Informatica. Using Tableau to analyze several data sources\u2014including data from a fleet of trucks that drives over 350 million miles a year\u2014they discovered that their best margins came from customers within half a mile of each other. An insight like that can define an entire business strategy, increasing efficiency and cutting costs. Serving over 150,000 customers per week and maintaining more than 115 production facilities and service centers, efficiency is key for AmeriPride Services. \u201cWe've got over 125 locations in North America, plants and service centers, and a fleet of trucks that drive over 350 million miles a year,\u201d says Steven John, Chief Information Officer of AmeriPride. Although AmeriPride had a wealth of data, Steven recognized the need for clearer, actionable analytics. \u201cWe did not have a foundation of clear and clean data and a way to present that in which we could actually build on that [data] and build up our customer experience,\u201d says Steven. Steven John\u2019s first big project as CIO of AmeriPride was selecting a visual analytics platform that could serve the entire organization. Steven ultimately chose Tableau for its flexibility and strong product roadmap: \u201cThe reason we went with Tableau is its solid today and it has a clear roadmap for the future. Tableau provides us with a great solution now and for years to come.\u201d In addition to adopting Tableau Desktop and Server, the IT team rebuilt AmeriPride\u2019s information stack to include HP Vertica and Informatica. As part of the rebuild, Steven prioritized self-service analytics for business users. \u201c[Tableau] is a tool where you can give the business that freedom and they create things you can never even imagine as an IT department. We just can't create those things in an ivory tower. And they in the trenches do a much better job at understanding their own analytics.\u201d Today, several teams use Tableau to understand business processes\u2014from finance and supply chain to transportation metrics. \u201cThey use this tool every morning when they come into work. It's the first thing they look at,\u201d says Steven. In the finance and supply chain sectors, business users soon discovered insights buried deep in the data. For example, these teams discovered that AmeriPride\u2019s best margins came from customers within half a mile of each other. Moving forward, this type of insight helps drive strategy to increase efficiency and cut costs. Steven explains, \u201cUntil we got those various data sources streaming together in a Tableau dashboard, we didn't realize that insight was there.\u201d Today, the company uses data to help direct customer experience strategy. The IT team handles security and governance, empowering the business to do what they do best\u2014drive profit and company growth. Additionally, the IT team established a data governance board that collaborates with business units on data relevance and quality. The IT team also conducts office hours where employees can meet with power users and ask questions about Tableau features and data sources. \u201cAs an IT team, we balanced freedom and order,\u201d says Steven, \u201cThe business now uses their time more efficiently, and they're taking Tableau and doing the things that only they can do, which is making more money and bringing us closer to our customers. They can now look at all these statistics and metrics, and they can do their job better.\u201d \u201cThe idea is the businesses are creating [their own tools and capabilities]. The businesses are driving it,\u201d says Steven. \u201cTableau is a window, a very sophisticated window, but it's a window into their business. And we let them run with that. IT isn't driving that. We are providing a fantastic set of tools, and we are providing any level of help they need.\u201d \u201cOur job is really to give them the freedom to govern themselves, and at the same time kind of behind the curtain making sure that there's order and that that's maintained.\u201d"

        "content": "Alexander Kurz is quick to describe himself as a data person. As the data and research manager for Thriving Together in Phoenix, Kurz is always on the search for quantitative insights into how more students can succeed in school en route to their careers. But even when Kurz discovered data insights that could help boost student performance, there was no guarantee of action. When he\u2019d share his findings, many of the school and district leaders were wary and defensive even though the data wasn\u2019t specifically critical of their individual work. \u201cI had to learn a lot around relationship-building\u201d\u2014a skill he admits he\u2019s had to hone, says Kurz. Over time, he refined his approach to starting conversations with teachers and administrators about student-performance data. Kurz is not alone, according to the discussion at a recent Tableau Data Fellows training. Selected from StriveTogether\u2019s nationwide network of 65 Cradle-to-Career programs, the 15 Data Fellows, Kurz included, are each working alongside educators to build a continuum of services and keep at-risk kids on course. Yet all shared experiences involving educators reluctant to analyze student- and school-performance data. But why? Wouldn\u2019t the insights help struggling or at-risk students succeed? Not everyone shares the enthusiasm over data, says Candace Simon, senior data analyst at Bridging Richmond in Richmond, Virginia. \u201cSchools are not that receptive when we initially say that we are working on their data, or we're working to support their data plans. Data culture, especially in the education setting, is usually met with a lot of tension,\u201d Simon said. As for a source of this tension, several point to the 2002 implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act and the use of standardized testing to measure adequate yearly progress toward achievement targets. At the time, NCLB was touted as a cutting-edge use of data in the education system. The law would reshape the education culture by holding teachers accountable for student outcomes, advocates believed. But 14 years later, there are indications that NCLB has actually weakened the data culture in many school districts. NCLB did help establish a more comprehensive and inclusive data infrastructure for districts, but few educators and administrators were educated on the use of data in their individual work. Since NCLB passed, the primary focus has been the end-of-year assessment of student performance. That type of testing does little to inform ongoing instruction; it primarily affects teacher evaluation. And in the absence of data to monitor student progress throughout the year, post-school year evaluation was akin to turning the crank on a Jack-in-the-Box\u2014a loud surprise with little forewarning. Tensions began rising almost immediately, in part due to negative evaluations resulting in pay freezes, skipped promotions, or even dismissals. Geoff Zimmerman was there in the early days, working with educators and administrators in the greater Cincinnati area. Now the interim executive director of StrivePartnership (the local StriveTogether member organization), he is supporting the StriveTogether team running the Data Fellows program with a sense for what went wrong\u2014and what might still be possible. \u201cWhen I started this work 10 years ago, one of the first project was a data report card on outcomes across Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky,\u201d said Zimmerman. \u201c[A]t the time, there was more of a finger-pointing mentality and not a lot of talk at all about data being used to improve.\u201d While the original intent was accountability, he\u2019s quick to point out that the data from this period went a long way in scoping the problem. For the first time researchers could disaggregate the data by different subgroups\u2014race, gender, poverty level\u2014but \u201cbeyond admiring the problem, we didn\u2019t do much at the time to build understanding of how using data can improve decision-making,\u201d Zimmerman said. By most estimates, this accountability-only approach did not provide the intended boost to student performance, but it did show that no single role owned the task of improving student performance. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve since tried to do with the StrivePartnership is create this idea of shared accountability and differentiated responsibility,\u201d Zimmerman said. Still, the ripples of the imbalanced rollout are still palpable to the Data Fellows. \u201cIn many, many cases, educators have been called out by virtue of data,\u201d said Kurz. \u201cSo, usually, the association with data is negative, and over time, this has built an aversion to data.\u201d Sarah Weppner of the Treasure Valley Education Partnership echoed her colleagues. Data has been used \u201cmore for accountability than improvement,\u201d said Weppner, director of continuous improvement at the Boise, Idaho organization. But she was also quick to point out the value in rebuilding trust by showing data \u201cas a flashlight rather than a hammer.\u201d The flashlight-hammer analogy comes up often when you talk to the Data Fellows. They\u2019ve developed a support network of sorts for dealing with people who distrust data. And their efforts to rebuild a culture of data deliberately starts at the top. Joe Adams, research coordinator with the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama, says workshops helped build confidence and shared understanding with local superintendents. Building a culture isn\u2019t something that happens overnight or can be adopted out of the box. It requires continued focus and principled decision-making to overcome varying degrees of defensiveness at every level. For many, earning buy-in from senior leadership is a critical\u2014and often challenging\u2014first step. A recent McKinsey Global Survey found that organizations with high-performing analytics programs are nearly three times more likely than their low-performing peers to have executive sponsorship for their analytics program. Comparing notes across the cohort, the fellows say the same is true in their school districts. In his workshops, Adams incorporates data visualizations into an environment that gives the superintendents a chance to explore the information just as he would, drilling down into certain issues without judgment. \u201cWe let the principals go through their day, function by function, just to see where they stand,\u201d said Adams. \u201cA lot of them have been through the reports that the state provides, but this kind of gives a clearer picture of where they are and how much they've gained from the previous year.\u201d The process is not designed to lead to specific conclusions, but rather to unearth other questions. The data can show what happened, but it is still up to the people in the room to ask why. \u201cThe data gives us a chance to have powerful conversations about groups of children who might not be doing as well as they should,\u201d said Adams. Other Data Fellows described variations on the workshop concept. Many build \u201cdata walks\u201d to allow educators to be equal participants in the analysis process rather than just the object of the findings. While the style of a data walk can vary, the core concept is to get people up, walking, and engaged around a set of questions. Facilitators are not telling participants what to think, but taking them through the process and helping them come to conclusions together. \u201cWhen we were able to present the data first and show them some of the bright spots, we get more buy-in,\u201d Simon said. \u201cPeople can really see how they can use data to help their work.\u201d Collaboration is a crucial piece of this culture-building, allowing people to quickly and easily share and build on each other\u2019s findings. The Data Fellows say it is important is to create a safe space where the educators can see themselves in the data and talk about their experiences. They\u2019re more open about changes and where those changes could be seen in the metrics. In doing so, the review and analysis of student-performance data becomes something that happens through teachers, not just to them during evaluations. Treasure Valley\u2019s Weppner has even seen a physical change in people as they go through the process. \u201cWe will have meetings where people are quite reserved. But then they get up for the data walks, and that's when the conversation really starts to generate,\u201d she said. By exploring data alongside educators in a trusted and secure environment, administrators can empower teachers to do what is necessary to help their students be successful. \u201cUltimately, I believe these conversations help to set up a strong factor analysis,\u201d said Zimmerman. \u201cOnce everyone has a shared idea of what we know, we can start looking into the strategies that are helping and that are hindering progress.\u201d In return, teachers have confidence that the district understands their reality as they make difficult decisions or advocate for increased resources. These types of feedback loops are critical to rebuilding data culture and the trust needed for schools to not just survive but to thrive. And with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) era dawning, educators at all levels have an opportunity to learn from the lessons of the NCLB experience. Kurz is optimistic that change is possible. While working alongside teachers and administrators to dive deeper into the data, he\u2019s seen attitudes quickly change. \u201cOnce we start digging, they realize they have a lot of data. Initially, we help them with that, but in the long term, we want to build capacity in the local sites so they can do it themselves. My hope is that I'm working myself out of a job,\u201d he said."

The report included data storytelling, which, over time, grew to be one of the most popular elements of the initial report. As the Business Alliance prepared the second edition for 2016, the team wanted to tell a fuller story with data. The team wanted to create interactive visualizations that empower anyone to explore the issues they care about the most. But the team also wanted some expert help thinking through ways to polish up the vizzes and make them truly memorable. Enter Sandlin Seguin, an e-learning specialist and Tableau Service Corps volunteer. Over several months, Sandlin worked with Hans and his team to explore best practices and develop a variety of storytelling tools. \u201cWe talked about a more viable way of presenting the information\u2014highlighting certain results, changing chart types\u2014and putting Washington in a regional and national context,\u201d says Sandlin.

The five-year \u201cVisualize No Malaria\u201d campaign empowers responders with real-time analytics to help save lives. Every year, malaria claims nearly 600,000 lives, most of them children under 5.

        "company": "BookerZzz",
        "content": "BookerZzz is an online travel company offering consumers some of the best short stays available in Europe. Founded in 2002, it currently helps more than one million travelers a year find their perfect European getaway through three core brands; HotelSpecials, HotelWeek and BungalowSpecials. BookerZzz implemented Tableau in 2016. Within the course of a year, the company rolled out Tableau across all 150 employees. Today, the whole company analyzes and shares data\u2014working off of a single source of truth. With interactive dashboards built in Tableau, employees make key decisions based on factors like hotel availability, marketing spend, and seasonal customer trends. Tableau helped break down internal data silos and saved as much as two hours each day for every member of the analyst team. As a successful online travel company serving over one million customers a year, BookerZzz processes large quantities of valuable customer and supplier data every day. As the company grew, employees found it increasingly difficult to manage growing data volumes or share meaningful business insights. When Manuel de Francisco Vera joined the company in March 2016 as Head of Big Data & Analytics, the root of the company\u2019s data problems started to emerge. Despite increased growth, BookerZzz remained heavily reliant on Excel spreadsheets as the sole means of storing and analyzing business data. As a result, the in-house analytics and management teams spent many hours each day manually mining the spreadsheets for useful insights\u2014a slow and laborious process. Furthermore, Manuel discovered that large amounts of valuable customer data failed to reach the analytics team at all. With the company workforce split over three main offices in The Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany, several local teams maintained their own spreadsheets, impeding the company\u2019s ability to see the complete business picture across Europe. The various search engine advertising (SEA) and search engine optimization (SEO) teams within BookerZzz exemplified this issue. With a total of 18 websites operating under the BookerZzz brand\u2014each with their own SEA team\u2014it was difficult to conduct comprehensive website analyses. Many of the SEO teams were operating independently at a local level, using their own analytics tools, which was counterproductive to overall business efforts. \u201cUnearthing insights and sharing information across the whole company was becoming extremely problematic,\u201d explains Manuel. \u201cSilos were appearing across the business, with important data locked inside. This issue of segregated data, combined with the growing volumes of information coming into the business was making the situation increasingly unmanageable. When the Excel spreadsheets start to break, that\u2019s the point where the system needs to change.\u201d Key internal stakeholders also had trouble making sense of the data. Senior management had to sift through spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, resulting in delayed decisions. Similarly, employees did not want to engage with the data. The bulk of BookerZzz employees are non-technical, meaning any new data solution needed to be both easy to use and accessible to individuals of all technical abilities\u2014while allowing them to perform deep analytics. In the face of mounting data issues, BookerZzz began looking for suitable business intelligence (BI) solutions. Following extensive research and a partner consultation, BookerZzz identified Tableau Desktop as the ideal solution for the company\u2019s visual analytics needs. A major factor in the initial decision was Tableau\u2019s ease of use alongside powerful analytics capabilities. Employees could perform advanced analytics without deep coding knowledge. Following a successful 14-day trial, BookerZzz purchased Tableau Desktop. When Manuel came on board shortly after that, internal engagement really took off. \u201cHaving worked extensively with Tableau in a number of previous analytics roles, I was already familiar with the software and the significant benefits it would bring to the way data was presented and used internally at BookerZzz,\u201d explains Manuel. Many teams received introductory training but weren\u2019t using Tableau to its full potential. Manuel stepped in to supplement their knowledge with advanced training courses. \u201cThis additional training, combined with the tutorials available on the Tableau website soon led to significantly increased user engagement.\u201d At the same time, Manuel started to promote collaborative analytics. The aim was to consolidate all BookerZzz analytics content\u2014like Google Analytics and Webmaster tools\u2014within a select number of Tableau dashboards for greater consistency across the company. Manuel also helped place Tableau champions within each department. These individuals work closely with the analytics team to test new dashboards and ensure they meet departmental needs before making them publicly available. Today, there are more than 80 active Tableau users within BookerZzz, representing over half of the total workforce. Users come from every department, including sales, marketing, content, and senior management. Each department has tailored dashboards containing pertinent data. Over time, Manuel and his team have distilled all of the company\u2019s data into 20 active Tableau dashboards that employees can access as needed. The team updates 10 of these dashboards on a daily basis. They use the remainder to track longer term trends and seasonal insights. The entire management team now uses a single Tableau dashboard to stay on top of key business information, saving Manuel and his team hours each day. All SEA and SEO data from all 18 websites feeds into the same Tableau dashboard. As a result, every team can compare metrics across all BookerZzz websites and senior management sees a comprehensive view of activity rather than just a piece of the data. \u201cSwitching to Tableau has saved every single member of my analytics team an average of two hours a day in manual data mining and bespoke search requests,\u201d says Manuel. \u201cWith Tableau, everyone can be an analyst. It\u2019s an incredibly powerful tool that has fundamentally changed the way we visualize and share business intelligence within BookerZzz.\u201d In addition to solving known business problems, Manuel and his team have also uncovered several undiscovered insights. Discovering these \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 has given BookerZzz a distinct competitive advantage in a number of important areas. \u201cUsing Tableau we\u2019ve gained invaluable insights into core business operations,\u201d says Manuel. \u201cOne of the most important was a much better understanding of the way our hotel partners allocate their rooms throughout the year and particularly at weekends. Knowing this has given us a stronger negotiating position for the future.\u201d Tableau has also helped Manuel\u2019s team find anomalies in traveler booking behavior. The team discovered that new music festivals or events caused unusual booking patterns. This knowledge gave BookerZzz a competitive advantage. \u201cKnowledge of these events means that in future we can tailor travel packages specifically for holidaymakers who wish to attend them, which is a win-win for everyone,\u201d explains Manuel. Finally, the team identified distinct differences between travelers from individual countries. For instance, Germans tend to holiday less than their Dutch counterparts, but when they do go away, they book further in advance and spend more during their trip. In contrast, Dutch holidaymakers book later and don\u2019t spend as much. This allows the BookerZzz team to change the way they market holidays to individual countries, ensuring that offered deals are the right fit for travelers. \u201cThese insights would undoubtedly have passed us by before we started using Tableau,\u201d concludes Manuel. \u201cIn the holiday industry where competition amongst providers is so high, Tableau helps us elevate ourselves above the crowd. This is what makes it such a powerful business tool.\u201d"

Research has shown a connection between kindergarten readiness and long-term student success for years. The state of Texas had already committed $136 million in funding for free and subsidized pre-k programs for qualifying families. For Commit!, the challenge was to reach those who weren\u2019t aware these programs were an option. Commit! took that challenge head-on. The organization mobilized its network of 45 education and social-service providers to get more kids signed up. Through the campaign, the organization helped 1,300 additional families enroll in these programs \u2013 giving their children a strong start on their education that they would have otherwise missed. In the process, Commit! members also made \u201cHope Charts,\u201d a student-achievement data framework. These visualizations help teachers and administrators keep students on track toward a meaningful career. This type of data-sharing is critical for \u201cCradle to Career\u201d programs, a student-support methodology that supports kids from birth through their entry into the workforce. Commit! is just one of 65 community coalitions bringing StriveTogether\u2019s Cradle to Career Network to low-income communities across the United States.

The success of Commit! and similar initiatives inspired StriveTogether and Tableau Foundation to launch a new nationwide Data Fellowship program to build data literacy throughout the network. Selected from StriveTogether\u2019s nationwide partner network, fellows in this train-the-trainer program learn Tableau skills and share them with peers across the country. The first cohort of 15 fellows is using real data from their work with local schools and service providers to quickly identify key insights. They are also developing new visualizations to help frame community conversations and allocate resources throughout the coalition. And many are already finding value in the newly-formed peer group. Geoff described conducting a \u201cgallery walk\u201d with the fellows when the group met for the first time at StriveTogether\u2019s 2015 National Cradle to Career Network Convening in Minneapolis.\n\u201cWe reviewed vizzes that fellows had already done and talked about what they hoped to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of them immediately identified ideas they wanted to include in their work, and it really set a collective sense of what comes next.\u201d  For the next year, the fellows will work with Tableau experts, thanks to our partners InterWorks and DecisionViz who will provide pro bono training. Then, after a year of training and experimentation, the fellows themselves will become the teachers. Each will provide peer training throughout the StriveTogether network on using data to better serve students and manage resources. \u201cEach of these communities is already working hard to close achievement gaps,\u201d says Geoff, \u201cWith every meeting, it is exciting to hear about what they\u2019ve been doing, what does and doesn\u2019t work, and what they hope to do next.\u201d"

        "content": "After evaluating several business intelligence solutions including Qlik, MicroStrategy, and Cognos, Win2Day decided on Tableau. With Tableau, teams creates dashboards \u201cat the speed of thought,\u201d fulfilling their requirements for flexibility, self-service, and performance. Win2Day has seen significant improvements in data transparency\u2014for product management and executives. Leadership now consults data on a regular basis, leading to more informed decision making. Tableau: Tell us about Win2Day. Michael Angeli, Head of Customer Relationship Management: Win2Day is a subsidiary of Austrian Lottery and Casinos Austria. We are the online platform branch and our offerings mirror the range of offline products. That is lotteries, poker, bingo, sports betting, and the entire range of casino product categories. Tableau: How did your Tableau implementation start? Michael Angeli: We chose Tableau a year ago, buying five [Desktop] pro licenses and a Server license to cover everyone else. With this, we became a lot more flexible, as MicroStrategy\u2019s internal processes are rather cumbersome. So now, with Tableau, we have the freedom of creating reports and dashboards ourselves with our analysts. Tableau: How does Win2Day use Tableau on a daily basis? Michael Angeli: We have various use cases for Tableau. Firstly, our Key Performance Indicators dashboard, the KPI system. But then Tableau is really helpful with all the ad-hoc reporting, revenue reporting, and incoming requests. All of these things we can get done very quickly and interactively with Tableau. Currently, we are working on integration with our SAP database. Tableau: What reaction have you received from users? Michael Angeli: We are very satisfied because it enables us to create dashboards and reports at the speed of thought \u2013 and have them be interactive. And it doesn\u2019t just make things transparent for product management, but also for the executive level. It makes us more open and transparent as a whole. Tableau: What benefits has the solution brought to your organization? Michael Angeli: Every Monday we used to create revenue reports with SAS. That was a manual effort of 2 to 3 hours. With the dashboards running virtually automatic, we got rid of that. With MicroStrategy, this dashboard cost us roughly \u20ac70,000. What we can already say is that [with Tableau] it takes a lot less time to create dashboards that are significantly more useful. So useful, in fact, that executive management is using them on a weekly, sometimes daily basis. Collaborating with executive management has become a lot easier. That is the biggest benefit of Tableau. Tableau: What was your BI situation before Tableau? Michael Angeli: After we had conceptualized a KPI dashboard, we were looking for a tool to actually visualize the KPIs we wanted. We decided to implement this dashboard with Tableau, because it gives us the freedom to things ourselves in the analytical CRM. We evaluated other alternatives. Our shortlist was Qlik, MicroStrategy, Cognos and others. Our main reason to go with Tableau was the performance. But you have to say, Tableau is sexy, too, and it\u2019s just fun to work with. We implemented a few things for our chair and the board, who really liked those things. This had the effect that now other business units were asked to follow in our footsteps. There is a desire to roll out Tableau throughout the entire organization. Tableau: In your opinion, what is a main strength of Tableau? Michael Angeli: I personally think Tableau Public is a great medium where you can find a lot of inspiration and adapt things to suit your own needs. That in itself is a unique selling point that other products are missing."

As he continues to grow his Tableau skills, Jens Bruckmann often consults Tableau community forums, summing up his experience with: \u201cWorking with Tableau is fun!\u201d Tableau: Can you tell us about Damovo? Jens Bruckmann, Operations Manager: We look after more than 2,000 customers across 100 countries in the field of voice communications. From project planning to entire phone systems for key accounts, networks, analog, digital, UC\u2014basically everything the modern communications market has to offer. You name it, we are doing it. Tableau: How do you use Tableau at your company? Jens Bruckmann: We use Tableau to report on service level agreements and operative KPIs, because it allows us to be very transparent towards our customers. We connect to an SQL interface, Salesforce, and Lucanet. We are also developing a web data interface for Cisco that will allow us to do live monitoring. There are a lot of opportunities for us to use Tableau in our business. Tableau: What do your users like most? Jens Bruckmann: We especially value the versatility and that it\u2019s very easy to present visualizations. Plus, it doesn\u2019t take a lot to be able to handle Tableau. It\u2019s true learning by doing. And the more you use it, the better you become and the more ideas you develop. Tableau: What benefit has the solution brought to your organization? Jens Bruckmann: We used to do a lot with Excel, and accordingly, the reporting was very time-consuming. It used to take several days for a report to be generated. We could cut that down a bit\u2014sometimes down to two or three hours per report with Excel automation. But now with Tableau, we are able to get those reports within 30 seconds with just a click. Tableau: What was the initial situation? Jens Bruckmann: Due to the report growing in complexity to the point where Excel just couldn\u2019t keep up, we had to find a new solution that was much more effective. We took a very careful look at the market and compared a lot of the competitors. We found Tableau to offer exactly what we needed and delivers the value we want at a price we are willing to pay. In our opinion that is the best possible outcome. Tableau: Are there any other things that you love about Tableau? Jens Bruckmann: What I really value in Tableau as a company is the flexibility. It\u2019s a very amicable relationship of short distances. That is a big plus. They are always ready to help. The community is great and the level of cooperation is remarkable. Working with Tableau is fun!"

These customized workbooks allow Minodes\u2019 customers to get a deep view into their data, refreshing it as it changes\u2014eliminating the need to create a new report every week. Today, Minodes delivers a scalable analytics-as-a-service offering that pleases employees and customers. Tableau: Tell us about Minodes. Daniel Getejanc, Head of Business Intelligence: What Google Analytics does for websites, Minodes does for offline retailers. We allow retailers to better understand consumers, how they move through stores, but also outside of stores. We do that using sensors, which we install everywhere and collect data through. Tableau: Can you share how Minodes uses Tableau? Daniel Getejanc: We are using Tableau internally, especially in the Business Intelligence team. But we are also using Tableau Server in order to provide our customers with direct access. There we are at roughly 500 users currently. We create a dashboard for our customers, so they can better understand their data. But we also analyze their marketing efficiency. So basically, we install this kind of sensors. For a medium-sized retail shop\u2014for example, in Munich\u2014we install 30 to 40 sensors that collect Wi-Fi signals. The collected data is processed by a machine learning algorithm that maps where the customers are in the store, how long they remain there and especially important, whether they do come back and if so, what do they do. In addition to that, we run specific analyses to generate actionable insights. Tableau: How did you analyze those huge data volumes before? Daniel Getejanc: Initially we created customer specific reports using Excel and PowerPoint. The biggest problem was scalability, because it involved a lot of manual work. And that is why we chose Tableau: it allows us to create truly individual dashboards for the customers, while automating the process behind the scenes saving us a lot of manual effort. We looked at a few alternatives but realized that especially the learning curve isn\u2019t as good as with Tableau. Tableau: What benefit has the solution brought to your organization? Daniel Getejanc: The biggest benefit is the flexibility we now have. The business intelligence team creates a template that we can re-use. And we don\u2019t have to manually refresh the data. It\u2019s all automated. We have a customer in high-end fashion and they wanted a weekly report. That took us 4 to 5 hours every Monday. Tableau has eliminated those 4 to 5 hours completely, and that\u2019s just one example. Tableau: How satisfied are your users? Daniel Getejanc: Our users are currently very satisfied. They especially love the flexibility in creating analyses. Before, everything was in SQL, Excel and PowerPoint. Now we can present the central insights directly with Tableau, while at the same time giving the customer the opportunity to ask their own questions of the data. Tableau: From your perspective, are there any other key aspects for which you'd recommend Tableau? Daniel Getejanc: The community, which is really engaged with the product, driving it forward and making sure Tableau stays as good as it is."

        "company": "SA Ambulance Service",
        "content": "The SA Ambulance Service is responsible for managing ambulance call-out and response for South Australia. Covering 100,000 square kilometers and servicing 1.7 million Australians, the ambulance service collects large amounts GPS and operational data. When combined with external data sources like weather forecast, this data provides valuable insights. Since introducing Tableau Desktop over four years ago, the business hasn\u2019t looked back. Today, the Operational Intelligence team shares data with management over Tableau Server. Management regularly uses Tableau workbooks to identify bottlenecks, making adjustments to daily operations in times of high demand. And with refreshes in Tableau Server, they always have access to current data. With area managers spread across the state, they can now easily access workbooks through Tableau Mobile\u2014bringing data to the field. Now that staff can track process improvements, the team is motivated to do more with data. In the future, SA Ambulance plans to incorporate geospatial ambulance data to improve workforce efficiency. The SA Ambulance Service is part of SA Health, reporting to the Minister for Health. The service is responsible for all ambulance call-outs across the state of South Australia. On average, the service handles up to 400,000 dispatches a year from emergency helicopter call-outs to non-urgent routine hospital pick-ups. Every ambulance journey generates location data. The Ambulance Service\u2019s Operational Intelligence team analyzes this data to track state-wide ambulance efficiency. To improve ambulance response times, the team scrutinizes up to a terabyte of incident response-related data at a time. Ali Mohtasham, Principal Analyst, explains, \u201cThe data we are analyzing is based on specific key performance indicators (KPIs) and our job is to identify bottlenecks, opportunities, and areas that require immediate attention.\u201d KPIs include ambulance response times for emergency, non-emergency, and urgent categories. Understanding ambulance workload ensures that vehicles are available in times of high demand. Ali said, \u201cWe wanted to look at different aspects of the operation and fine tune them based on the demand.\u201d Four specialists on Operational Intelligence team advise management on every aspect of the operational activity. Some ad-hoc requests from stakeholders took 30 minutes, while projects like ambulance service analysis could take up to six months. Ali recalled, \u201cPreviously to answer these requests, we had to write specific queries and export them to Excel which was an extremely detailed and time-consuming process. My team was limited to how many requests they could respond to.\u201d Managers wanted to see and interact with the data at their regular meetings to look at past trends and plan for the future. To meet the company\u2019s needs, the team needed a solution that allowed them to deep dive into the data in real time. The team\u2019s previous analytics software was designed to produce statistical process control charts. These charts provided limited information, were restricted in their functionality, and could be difficult to understand and interpret. This made it difficult for the management team to share information with ambulance stations. Ali explains, \u201cThe data wasn\u2019t easily accessible to everyone. We had to export the charts and send them through email.\u201d When management had further questions, they had to wait for a response in their inbox. The whole process could take weeks. Spanning a large geographical area, stakeholders wanted data in an easy-to-understand format, that didn\u2019t require coding or hours of explanation. The company completed a business case requiring the team to address the merits of up to four software solutions. When trialing Tableau, managers were impressed. Soon after, the company decided to purchase Tableau Desktop. Ali said, \u201cWe put the shortlist into a business matrix which looks at a bunch of different areas from ease of use, to cost of ownership, to the risk to the organization. Tableau came out with the highest ranking in every aspect.\u201d The SA Ambulance Service started off with Tableau Desktop in 2012 and executives across the business quickly realized the power that Tableau could bring to data-driven decision making. Ali commented, \u201cOur executive team saw the results of Tableau immediately and they started to request the team work on different tasks.\u201d With this buy-in, the Operational Intelligence team purchased Tableau Server for the management group, allowing them to easily access and refresh Tableau dashboards. Today, 40 people access Tableau Server on a regular basis, and there are over 1,000 workbooks on the production server. Day to day, the Operational Intelligence team creates hundreds of dashboards to monitor the operational performance of the business. After a short training session, the management team could explore the data in Tableau. To ramp up management and employees, the Operational Intelligence team regularly hosts data workshops. Using Tableau has made data much more visible across the organization. Ali comments, \u201cThere is no reason not to be aware of what\u2019s happening in each region, sub-region or management group. Tableau allows us to explore where the bottlenecks are. When the data is in front of you, accountability is increased, which gives managers a platform to explain why performance has changed, whether it be in a positive or negative way.\u201d Ali has seen a shift in the way the organization makes decisions. \u201cData doesn\u2019t always have the answers but it starts the conversation to discuss what can be done or identify whether there\u2019s anything that needs to be done. Now, people are making decisions based on the data.\u201d For example, the management team may choose an ambulance station to test a new process, such as a change to the meal schedule for ambulance crews. Once the trial is complete, the Operational Intelligence team reviews the data and shares insights with the management team. Then they decide whether to implement the change across the state. Now that the team can bring all of their data into one place, they can respond to ad-hoc requests faster than ever. The Operational Intelligence team pulls data from Microsoft SQL Server and Excel files into Tableau. Ali explains, \u201cSince we started using Tableau, we can respond to three times more ad hoc requests in the same period of time it took us using our old systems.\u201d With Tableau, the team easily brings this data together to discover patterns and correlations that benefit the organization. For example, these correlations can forecast demand, ensuring the SA Ambulance Service is always prepared. \u201cOne of the busiest times of the year for us is the flu season,\u201d says Ali. \u201cBy looking over the data from the past five or six years, we have been able to pinpoint when the demand will spike, enabling us to put extra staff on duty and increase our fleet of ambulances. Tableau is helping us save lives in South Australia.\u201d Now managers can access data through Tableau Server. They \u201cfavorite\u201d visualizations for fast access, allowing them to keep track of the data they care about. And permissions allow managers to download workbooks and dig into the data themselves. Ali explains, \u201cWe can have up to 1,000 workbooks on the server at any one time. Being able to bookmark the data sets that are only useful to each manager saves time and allows them to focus on the insights that matter.\u201d Managers also frequently reference visualizations in their weekly, monthly, and quarterly forecasting meetings. With the SA Ambulance Service reporting to the Minister of Health, Tableau provides the perfect format to showcase their KPIs. Ali explains, \u201cThe team downloads a dashboard from the server and sends it to the Department of Health through email.\u201d \u201cBy sharing this data we are able to start a discussion on these points. Often there are questions during these discussions and now we can immediately drill through to the spot rather than having to go back and forth like we did with our previous model. We are seeing solutions come about much quicker as a result.\u201d With ambulance managers scattered across the state, it\u2019s important for them to be able to access data on the go. Most stations use Tableau Mobile on iPads or access Tableau Server on laptops. \u201cA picture is worth a thousand words. The managers use Tableau Mobile to share the insights we\u2019ve discovered at executive team meetings. It allows them to compare the performance of all the ambulance crews.\u201d Ali and his team are looking forward to see how they can use Tableau in more areas to help improve processes. \u201cOver the coming year we will be adding other data sources such as ambulance geo-data with the aim of minimizing driving time and improving service. We see Tableau 10 playing a big part in that. We are excited, as always, to explore the next version.\u201d"

        "content": "MillerCoors produces popular beer brands including Miller, Coors, and Blue Moon. Its retail sales force is always on the go, communicating with bars and restaurants. In just 90 days, MillerCoors went from pilot phase to enterprise deployment of Tableau across 300 salespeople. With Tableau Cloud, a MillerCoors sales person can pull up a sales dashboard to share with retailers over a mobile phone or tablet, strengthening relationships and differentiating them from competitors. Internally, the team established one source of truth for sales reporting, increasing visibility to spot opportunities and sell more product. MillerCoors\u2019 sales team regularly compiles data to identify the most profitable products for retailers. Before Tableau, MillerCoors\u2019 sales team had to manually extract data from countless Excel reports\u2014often working through the weekend to understand the data. With Tableau Cloud, Jim Webb, Director of Customer Solutions explains: \u201cIn the car, in the parking lot, 15 minutes before their meeting, they can pull down the full sales report and see what they need to address with the retailer and pull together some key opportunities to help our retailer grow the size and value of their beer category.\u201d \u201cWhen our team sells, they\u2019re doing it with an iPad over the bar and everybody's busy. And without a cloud-based solution that they can pull down on a mobile device, it's a really difficult conversation to have,\u201d explains Jim. Tableau Cloud fits in with the mobile nature of MillerCoors\u2019 sales force, giving them the flexibility to bring data into daily conversations. \u201cA cloud-based solution for us was really the fastest and easiest way to bring some of this insight to our customers,\u201d says Jim. \u201cTableau Cloud in particular was a really great way to deliver that based on the mobile nature of our sales force and based on the selling cycle that they deal with.\u201d In just 90 days, MillerCoors moved from pilot stages to a full enterprise deployment with their retail sales force. \u201cCloud was a great way to quickly implement a solution, not have to worry about a big infrastructure spend or a big infrastructure ramp-up within our company,\u201d shares Jim. \u201cWe were able to seize an opportunity very quickly and then scale it from a small pilot community into our entire sales team in less than three months.\u201d Today, around 300 sales people access dashboards with Tableau Cloud. This cloud solution allowed the company to start small and scale as needed. \u201cThis was a natural fit for a Tableau evolution for us in our first really big enterprise deployment. I don't envision another solution where we could have gone from a test case to a pilot group to a full deployment in 90 days like we did with Tableau Cloud.\u201d With a culture of Excel reporting, salespeople had a hard time distinguishing which report was correct. \u201cWe had five or six different reports that each sales person was having to use and they all kind of picked their favorite. Whichever one they knew and understood the best, that's the one that they were going to focus on.\u201d As a result, salespeople sometimes missed bigger opportunities, simply because they didn\u2019t have an efficient way of discovering them. With Tableau, the sales team now has one source of truth for sales dashboards\u2014allowing them to see the full spectrum of customers and take action when opportunity arises. \u201cWhat we've been able to do with Tableau is make sure that sales sees the full universe of what they should be focusing on to find the biggest and best opportunity. In turn, this will help grow our business and help grow the retailer's business.\u201d The team publishes sales target dashboards on Tableau Cloud, creating better visibility and igniting collaboration and healthy competition between team members: \u201cWe have everyone's sales targets on Tableau Cloud now, so we've got some great healthy competition amongst our team to make sure that everyone's working together to meet their goal.\u201d In addition to discovering sales opportunities, the MillerCoors field sales team uses Tableau Cloud to share data with retailers. \u201cIn a world of hundreds of taps, we need data to help our bar managers succeed,\u201d explains Jim. \u201cWe used Tableau in other departments for around two years. We saw a great opportunity to really take a large workload out of their day and present better information to our retailers.\u201d With Tableau dashboards, sales people can show retailers the key drivers for their business, help them understand consumer demographics, and determine how they compare to similar establishments. \u201cEveryone has their own gut feel about beer and what's important to them, but we can really use the data available to us from Tableau Cloud to go in and tell them what\u2019s actually happening in the market.\" These insights help retailers sell more product, strengthening sales relationships and increase profits. This access to data helps differentiate MillerCoors sales representatives from competitors: \u201cNo one has ever brought these independent bars and restaurants a really conclusive market view. We're able to go in and tell them, \u2018hey, you're selling more or less than you did a year ago.\u2019\u201d Jim shares how he often gets phone calls from sales representatives about \u201chow it\u2019s making their life faster and easier.\u201d And as salespeople advance within the company, they\u2019re requesting to bring Tableau with them. \u201cI've always been working with data to tell stories to retailers and try to help grow their business. And when I can see an entire sales force of 250 people who are able to engage and tell those stories, thanks to Tableau Cloud, that makes a big difference in my day and how we go to market with our customers.\u201d \u201cWe sell beer for a living. It's a fun product, it's a fun company. But we do use lots of data. And data's not always fun. So playing with Tableau, getting it online, getting it out into everybody's hands, it's a great way to take a fun product and make the analysis out of it fun as well.\u201d"

        "content": "Masabi uses Tableau Desktop to integrate and analyze different datasets from the Masabi JustRide mobile ticketing platform. Transport operators use Tableau Cloud to access analytics in the cloud. With real-time, easy-to-understand insights, operators make faster decisions, drive rewarding passenger experiences, and better schedule services according to demand\u2014increasing operational efficiency.     Masabi makes city transport smarter by simplifying ticketing and streamlining fare collection, validation, and management for transport providers. The organization\u2019s solutions are live with the New York MTA and LA Metrolink, together with 23 other operators around the world, including RTA Las Vegas, Transport for Athens, the MBTA in Boston, RTA in New Orleans and London\u2019s Thames Clippers. Masabi is helping each of these cities become a more integrated, tech-enabled location\u2014a smart city. Millions of passengers use Masabi\u2019s JustRide mobile ticketing and fare collection platform to buy and display tickets on their smartphone for faster, frictionless journeys. As a result, transport authorities and operators save money on expensive ticket vending machines, avoid the costs of printing tickets, and reduce the overall cost of fare collection. One of the key advantages of the JustRide platform is the real-time data collected on ticket sales. Masabi collects data points every time a ticket is purchased, activated for use, and scanned by transit staff. This gives agencies insight into ticket sales volume, traffic between individual stations, and patterns in travel schedules. This is a new domain for most operators. Before adopting JustRide, operators relied on basic ticket sales data to understand customers\u2019 travel behavior, collecting data from physical gate ticketing systems weeks, sometimes months, after the passengers\u2019 date of travel. But they would rarely analyze the data due to the age and limited scope. When they did, the analysis was limited to understanding total transaction volumes. In extreme instances, some operators simply relied on a staff member using a handheld \u2018clicker\u2019 to manually count passengers on a train or a station. \u201cMasabi is at the forefront of the shift away from the cost and hassle of issuing and handling physical ticket media,\u201d explains Jonathan Hyde, Product Manager, Masabi, \u201cDuring every transaction, JustRide captures data in real-time, on everything from ticket sales and validation, to customer service administration and ticket management. We want the operators to use this data to enhance the passenger travel experience and improve operations.\u201d The challenge for Hyde and the Masabi product management team is to present the data and subsequent reports to the transport providers. To provide value to operators, the reports had to be scalable, secure, and intuitive.     When looking for a business intelligence solution, Hyde says they \u201capplied the same three criteria to every problem [they] solve in Product Management.\u201d Hyde explains, \u201cFirst, any solution we choose has to be valuable. I knew from my previous experience at another company with Tableau visual analytics that the operators would love the flexibility and simplicity. Second, the solution has to be useable\u2014and few software applications are as easy and intuitive as Tableau. And third, it needs to be feasible. Tableau Cloud, in particular, is quick and easy to deploy, and requires very little training. For all these reasons, we chose Tableau to support our analytics strategy for operators.\u201d Hyde first had to convince Masabi\u2019s senior management that Tableau was the right choice. \u201cWe needed to quickly demonstrate the power of visual analytics. With Tableau, we can integrate different datasets from the JustRide mobile ticketing platform and instantly turn them into compelling visualizations.\u201d \u201cThat initial cloud analytics deployment was quick and easy and involved very little development effort. Most importantly, both the Masabi executives and the operators we presented it to loved what they saw\u2014it opened their eyes to insights they never knew were possible,\u201d says Hyde. Today, Masabi utilizes Tableau Desktop to integrate different datasets from the JustRide mobile ticketing platform and create interactive dashboards. Masabi delivers data to operators with Tableau Cloud, with two instances \u2014 one in the U.S. and one in the E.U. supporting operators in each respective location. Before operators go live on JustRide, Masabi works with them to determine the metrics they want to see. Masabi adapts the standard reports to ensure that operators can answer their core questions. For example, the most popular stations, purchasing times, or mobile operating system usage. Masabi sets permissions in Tableau Cloud so that providers only see the data that is relevant to them\u2014keeping data secure. When asked about training, Hyde commented, \u201cThe great thing about Tableau is how quickly you see the results. The free Tableau product videos, online learning, and forums are great places to learn more, and have definitely helped speed up our deployment.\u201d     With help from Masabi and Tableau, operators now have access to data that can drive an even more rewarding passenger experience, while increasing operational efficiency. For example, with improved visibility into peak demands, operators can schedule services accordingly.   With Tableau Cloud, Masabi can connect and refresh data that lives in the cloud without additional technical complexities. Masabi also has the flexibility to host instances in the United States or Europe\u2014depending on the customer\u2019s location.   Hyde recalls, \u201cWe were in the U.S. meeting with a transit authority. We had shown them some of the standard analytical views we thought might be useful. But then one of the clients in the meeting wanted to see how many tickets were being sold at one of their primary stations on a Monday morning. I filtered the data, refreshed it, and presented the new view in about 30 seconds. They were blown away.\u201d   This agile reporting is also helping to scale Masabi\u2019s business. The company is a lean, fast-growing organization, working with transport providers large and small \u2014many of which have been in business for many decades and employ tens of thousands of staff. \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate the difference a small company like Masabi is making to the way these operators look at their data,\u201d say Hyde.   Hyde concludes, \u201cOperators need to understand how JustRide is used on their network and who is using it. Tableau gives them that fast, intuitive insight.\u201d"

With automated reporting, the engineering team saves time and resources, and employees find new value in their data. With help from Tableau, ARM has a solution that fosters self-service data exploration and scales with their business. Tableau: Can you share a little bit about ARM? Andrew Jones, Staff Engineer, ARM (silicon chip IP design): ARM produces the data as most companies do, and one of our biggest data sets are around testing and verification of our hardware designs, and also around the compute clusters on which these applications happen. Tableau: When did you introduce Tableau? Andrew: So we introduced Tableau to ARM around four years ago as one of the front ends to our metrics platform. Our metrics platform already had a simple web user interface (UI) and a REST API. But we wanted to produce some reports and visualizations, and we wanted to do them as quickly and easy as possible. So we wanted something quick and easy to build, and easy to maintain going forward. Tableau: What challenges were you facing before Tableau? Andrew: Before we used Tableau, a lot of this was done in Excel and PowerPoint, and they projected it themselves. Every Friday they'd create these Excel metrics and deliver them. Tableau: How has Tableau helped you solve those challenges? Andrew: So Tableau has enabled us to build and deliver official, standard reporting across all projects, automated every week without an engineer spending that precious time doing it themselves each time. So we started using Tableau around four years ago, [where we had] two to five people as a team. Since then, other departments in ARM heard about Tableau and seen what we've done in Tableau, and they've come to ask us for access to Tableau Server and for licenses. And they've just gone off and built their own Tableau reports since then. So now it's used by many parts of the company. Tableau: What are you planning for the future? Andrew: As part of our team, our future is always to enable others to [get self-service access to data]. So giving users the ability to process their data, put data to Tableau in a clean, structured way, and then use Tableau to build reports. I think what I want to do going forward is kind of create more of a Tableau community at ARM, so you can have the regular user groups that can meet up, some may share knowledge, maybe we've got an internal communication channel that we can use to do that. And just try and get more ways of community so we can kind of learn from each other. We can kind of share best practices. And just generally share the work that's being done in Tableau. Not only to improve our knowledge of Tableau, but also to help share knowledge generally in ARM, which is always a good thing."

        "content": "To address resource constraints, PIPC adopted Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server. In Tableau Desktop, analysts can easily recreate analyses for customers instead of starting from scratch with every new request. Analysts leverage R in Tableau, pulling data from Microsoft Access, SQL Server, and Excel. With Tableau Server, PIPC shares data with customers in a secure environment. Increasing data quality with visual analytics ultimately helped increase productivity among PIPC employees. For an average of 15 reports, this process reduced reporting time from 12 hours to 5 minutes. With Tableau, PIPC has streamlined their workflow, with more room to explore new ideas and test hypotheses with a few clicks. In 2013, the number of patent applications around the world was 2,568,000. In the same year, Korea was ranked as the world's number one in resident patent applications per GDP $100 billion and per million population. A core element that drives a company\u2019s valuation is its intellectual property rights. In research and development, companies collect technical data of similar or competing products and analyze domestic and overseas patent information. As important business decisions hang on these analyses, accuracy is crucial. Patent Information Promotion Center (PIPC) is a public organization that provides patent information and supports policies of the Korean Intellectual Property Office. PIPC\u2019s consulting division analyzes patent data to guide their customers in the right direction. As part of this process, PIPC researches worldwide patent documentation to help the customer understand the competitive landscape and important statistics related to the customer\u2019s specific technology. For existing data, PIPC's analysts used Excel for both analysis and visualization\u2014an incredibly manual, time-consuming process. It took at least half a day to create 10 to 15 reports and up to a day to distribute the final versions. And each new request required analysts to once again cycle through the manual process. Acquiring data was increasingly difficult\u2014making it harder to produce high-quality reports for customers. PIPC\u2019s standard process couldn't meet ever-increasing customer needs for higher-quality, deeper statistical analyses. With restricted IT resources, PIPC needed a self-service solution built on governed data. And they needed to be able to securely share this data across the company. In addition, PIPC\u2019s consulting division wanted to work more collaboratively with customers around patent consulting reports. To enhance customers\u2019 understanding, PIPC needed to make their analysis reports more intuitive with visual analytics. To address this challenge, PIPC started to search for a new approach to analysis. PIPC decided to adopt a business intelligence (BI) solution to better serve customers. PIPC reviewed around 20 BI solutions available in the market before deciding on Tableau. Compared with other BI solutions, Tableau Desktop allowed PIPC\u2019s analysts to notice patterns in the data and visualize them easily. It also implemented powerful statistical calculations with a simple drag and drop\u2014encouraging data discovery. During their trial period, PIPC evaluated Tableau for data exploration, rich analysis, and the ability to share data both internally and externally. Another major criteria for PIPC was ease of use. They needed a tool that was both easy to adopt and enjoyable for customers to use. They found that Tableau fit all of these requirements. Dr. Jea-tek Ryu, Senior Researcher, IP analysis team at PIPC said, \"We chose Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server so that our analysts can analyze various data, including third party data. When demonstrating Tableau, we raised work efficiency and productivity by largely reducing the time to analyze numerous data sources. Today, most of our time is only spent on data updates.\" Today, PIPC conducts analysis in Tableau Desktop, sharing final workbooks with customers over Tableau Server. PIPC analysts leverage R in Tableau, pulling data from Microsoft Access, JSON files, SQL Server, and Excel. With Tableau, PIPC has the option to connect to data both on-premises or in the cloud. Today, analysts don\u2019t have to rebuild reports for every request. They publish a set of reports for each department over Tableau Server, allowing business users to drill down deeper and conduct their own analyses. As a result, PIPC reduced average labor time around reporting by more than 90%\u2014from 12 hours to 5 minutes. When PIPC\u2019s analysts need to adapt a workbook, they simply tweak it instead of rebuilding the entire report. This fosters more efficient analytics processes across the entire business. Previously, PIPC analysts had a hard time ensuring data quality within their reports. Today, they can easily spot data concerns before starting their analysis. Internal users can now create their own visualizations, built on accurate data. With reduced labor and resources, employees now have time to focus on more strategic projects. They can also process more customer demands, creating more room for expanded business opportunities. With Tableau Desktop, PIPC\u2019s analysts can achieve rich analytical depth with a few clicks of the mouse. And with Tableau\u2019s R integration, they can easily visualize statistical data. Analysts can now answers questions in their data at the speed of thought, allowing them to explore questions as they arise. This enables rich data storytelling. In Tableau Server, users can now access Tableau on their mobile devices, through PIPC\u2019s web portal, giving consultants added flexibility on the go. Before Tableau, analytics were restricted to technical roles. Today, data scientists curate data sources for self-service discovery across PIPC. This results in time savings, higher quality reporting, and deeper analytical capabilities across the board. Check out this on-demand webinar to learn more how PIPC is using Tableau."

Marcus Kresin, Group CIO, shares how Intro Group can quickly integrate existing data sources, merging commercial and operational data within minutes. This way, they can efficiently replace existing reporting systems if needed. In Tableau, Intro Group localizes workbooks to serve analysts all over the globe\u2014and to collaborate on international projects. Marcus highlights how \u201cTableau is bringing people together from different departments [to] see specific drivers and specific data patterns.\u201d Tableau: Please introduce yourself and your company. Marcus Kresin, Head of IT and BI: My name is Marcus Kresin and I\u2019m the head of IT and business intelligence at Intro Group. The family of Intro Group started round about eighty years ago with a family business, mainly in fashion retail. In the last decades, we also expanded into other areas like travel and transportation, namely airlines, hotel business, real estate and we are mostly active there in investments, in interim management, and of course, in advisory services. Tableau: How does Intro Group use Tableau as a whole? Marcus Kresin: When we start up new companies or we take over distressed companies, the insight into the data to understand what is happening within companies is a key point for us. We are mainly using Tableau Desktop and in larger environments, our customers are using Tableau Server environments. We try to bring in the expertise we have from the industry and from the data analyses into the companies and then to run it locally. When you turn around airlines, it's very important that you have an insight into the data, that you actually see what is happening in detail. How does the passenger behavior change? Is there any change in the booking patterns? So we use a daily data feed from reservation systems and then we analyze the snapshot data. With the output of the analyses we agree on specific actions and then we again use Tableau to monitor the success of those actions. Tableau: What do your users like most? Marcus Kresin: One of the really nice things with Tableau is the development speed. This is what the users like. Tableau: What benefit has the solution brought to your organization? Marcus Kresin: One of the big advantages for us is that you really can enable a fast decision-making. Tableau for us is a strong contributor to the success of our projects. Analysis is only a brick in the whole chain, but a very important brick, and this brick we don't want to miss. Tableau: What was a deciding factor in choosing Tableau? Marcus Kresin: The key decision point for Tableau is the multi-language set-up. We have the possibility with Tableau Server to operate Tableau worldwide. It's not only about showing how it is, but it's also very important for us in running the companies, in understanding why it is like that. Tableau: Are there any other reasons you'd recommend Tableau? Marcus Kresin: One of the most important non-technical aspects for us working with Tableau is bringing people together from different departments. They see how their analysis is growing. They start to discuss about the business. They see specific drivers and specific patterns. And they start actually talking about the key to success."

By setting user permissions and governing what clients see in Tableau Server, ORU Aquitaine creates a personalized experience. When a client logs into Tableau Server, they only see dashboards that are relevant to them. Since ORU Aquitaine's shift to Tableau, some 36 clients have shared that they're gaining insights about their emergency room data that they never knew before. Tableau: How has Tableau helped you? Antoine Tignon, IT Developer/Engineer: Thanks to Tableau, I was able to put data that had been a bit obscure up until now into a nice, readable format. Tableau: Why did choose Tableau over other solutions? Antoine: The idea was to quickly set up feedback on the data that had been collected since as far back as 2008 in the case of some institutions. We, therefore, performed a case study on the different types of software that might be out there for data analysis and visualization. After several tests, we realized that Tableau was the quickest to set up, the least costly, and most of all, the most appealing. Having such sexy chart elements makes things much more practical when discussing them with physicians, institution managers, or politicians. We soon found that Tableau was the solution that best suited us for quickly moving forward in terms of observation and showing that we had something useful. Tableau: What reaction did you receive from clients? Antoine: At the time, there were 36 institutions in the region, 36 emergency departments that were rather surprised to see that we already had all this information about how their emergency departments were working and how people were being cared for. Also, to have an idea about chain analysis and to know where patients with heart disease had been referred to. People didn\u2019t expect us to have this type of information so quickly because the database was put together just a short time before. But no one had really looked into it or given any feedback. Having this chart element of Tableau, and having set it up in a about three months before we were publishing on our website with the help of dashboards, and providing institutions with loads of data items with complete transparency. Tableau: What prompted you to start using Tableau Server to share dashboards with clients? Antoine: Now, with the arrival of the grand region and thus of Aquitaine-Limousin-Poitou-Charentes, we made the choice to start up with Tableau Server, to have a few more users and a more territorial vision. This way, when someone from, for example, Dordogne logs on, instead of connecting to a random institution of the grand region, they reach their own territory and get information that is relevant to them. We started with quickly accessible dashboards, which showed a lot of data quickly, and eventually arrived at something even more accurate and people-oriented, to tell them more and to allow them to really immerse themselves in the information."

Allison Nau, Head of Data Intelligence, shares how the company has visibility into more than 3 million used vehicle transactions per year from dealer websites. This data all lands in a Cloudera Hadoop distribution running in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud. Tableau connects directly to their Hadoop environment, enabling Allison\u2019s team to create a solution that leverages existing data to calculate repair costs. They can now quickly determine the grade to which a vehicle should be reconditioned to maximize resale value. Because of these analytics, vendors see an average 54% return on investment. Allison describes how their success with Tableau has enabled them to keep \u201ca razor-sharp focus\u201d on the commercial value for their clients. Tableau: What kind of data do you work with? Allison Nau, Head of Data Intelligence: Cox Automotive has more data than any other company in the U.K. around the used vehicle lifecycle. We bring together wholesale and retail data to provide those actionable insights. We have visibility into more than 3 million used vehicle transactions a year for dealer websites that we host\u2014the used vehicle locators for more than a dozen major manufacturers. I have the awesome responsibility of bringing together the data that we have around each of our business areas in order to provide actionable insight for our team members and our automotive clients. Tableau: What databases do you connect to? Allison: We're setting up our own Hadoop cluster, leveraging the Cloudera distribution of Hadoop hosted in Azure that's really going to be able to give us access to streaming information about our websites. We know which consumers from which areas are searching for which vehicles at what time of day, what's coming up in their search results, what vehicles are they clicking through\u2014we've got that vast array of information. Tableau: What challenges were you facing before Tableau? Allison: One of the things that they've been struggling with is trying to convince vendors (leasing companies, manufacturers), that it's worth investing in the reconditioning of a vehicle in order to achieve a higher price when the cars go through the lanes at auction. Tableau: What role did your team play? Allison: They challenged my team to come up with a tool to help with the presales\u2014something that that the sales guys can use, have it on a phone, have it on a tablet, that they can help to convince vendors that they should recondition the vehicles. Allison: They were blown away by what we were able to demonstrate, because we had built a solution using Tableau that, for every single vehicle that comes through our business on the wholesale side of things, we can take that inspection report, work out what the costs of the repair should be, and figure out to which grade a vehicle should be reconditioned. The board of the inventory solutions business was really impressed with what had happened, so much so that three weeks later they announced at an industry conference that we were turning it into a product. Tableau: What results have you seen? Allison: I think it just goes to show the massive excitement and interest in the business and real tangible financial benefits. We've worked out that on average vendors should spend 82 pounds reconditioning a vehicle, and they would get an average increase in price of 126 pounds for the vehicle being sold. So that's a 44 pound return on investment\u201454 percent. Tableau: What is your favorite feature of Tableau? Allison: I think the biggest thing for me is how Tableau is an enabler. We need to make sure that we're always thinking about the commercial side of things, the \"why we are doing this.\" And I think that's enabled my team and what we're doing within Cox Automotive to be quite successful and to maintain that executive buy-in and get further executive buy-in, all the way up to the board in the U.S.; is by keeping a razor-sharp focus on the commercial value for our people and for our clients."

Ubisoft recruited Data & Business Intelligence Manager, Ga\u00eblle Periat for her analyst skillset\u2014which included Tableau. Ga\u00eblle found Tableau through her job at IsCool, and rapidly moved from novice to enthusiast\u2014spreading the word with her friends, and then professionally with executives and coworkers. As Ga\u00eblle rose through the world of gaming, Tableau became a constant part of her workday. When asked if Ga\u00eblle sees Tableau as part of her future, she said, \u201cI definitely don't see myself pursuing any of my new professional projects in data without Tableau.\u201d Tableau: Do you see yourself continuing to use Tableau throughout your career? Ga\u00eblle Periat, Data & Business Intelligence Manager: I definitely don't see myself pursuing any of my new professional projects in data without Tableau. Tableau: What was your background professionally prior to finding Tableau? Ga\u00eblle: Before working purely with data, I was a developer for approximately ten years. Like all developers, I had many assignments. On the very last one, before I turned to the dark side of data, I was in a decision support team on a large website. In fact, that is where I began to understand the value and the power of data, as we could collect everything that the Internet users were doing and point out many, many things to them. Tableau: Did you see immediate value in your approach to data? Ga\u00eblle: That really interested me and at the end of about one year of development, I told them, \"OK, it's cool, but I don't want to do development anymore; what I want is to crunch data, to understand people. There you have it\u2014I want to tell stories about what people are doing on our website.\" Tableau: Can you describe your first encounter with Tableau? Ga\u00eblle: When I arrived at IsCool, they told me, \"Hey, here's Tableau; it\u2019s going to be your best friend for life.\" And I said, \"OK, but no training, nothing at all?\" They said, \"Well, no, it's really simple, you'll manage.\" Tableau: Did you? Ga\u00eblle: Actually, it was really simple. I told wonderful stories about the video games we were creating at the time, and then I started to share that with friends, with people that I liked, and then professionally. I did a certain number of conferences, and one day I met one of the founders of BlaBlaCar, and then, there you have it, we talked data... In the same manner, he told me, \"OK, that's super, do you feel like coming to BlaBlaCar to do data work?\u201d I said, \"Well, yeah, why not?\u201d There you go, I did that in video games; I'll go see what I can achieve at BlaBlaCar. Tableau: Can you share more about that transition? Ga\u00eblle: I actually brought Tableau to BlaBlaCar. When I arrived, I called my Tableau account manager and told him: \"Hi, it's Ga\u00eblle from IsCool, who is now Ga\u00eblle from BlaBlaCar, now I need Tableau at BlaBlaCar. How can we do that?\" So, we began like that, with a few Tableau licenses and now, practically the whole company uses Tableau. Tableau: Have you found the same continuity and ability to move fast with Tableau? Ga\u00eblle: In the same manner, at Ubisoft, it was, \"Hi, we like what you are doing, could you bring a little of your expertise our way?\" I told them \"yes.\" Obviously, because I love creating, I love sharing and there I was fortunate enough that they were already using Tableau; but I thought that we could do even better. That is to say, that we could still involve other people, and then go even further in data visualization. Tableau: Did you have any Tableau training? Ga\u00eblle: When I learned Tableau, I had no training, so I joined the community and there, in the same manner, you can ask questions that seem a bit simple or a bit complicated for you, and there is always someone who answers you. Tableau: Do you use the Tableau community forums? Ga\u00eblle: As it\u2019s a worldwide community, the benefit is that you can ask a question before you go to bed and, by the time you get up, a nice American has answered you. Also, what's crazy is that if you really have a big mental block, you can post your file, and someone will correct it and return it to you, saying, \"Well, there you go, you should've done this, you should've done that.\" So, in terms of community it is really exceptional. I have never seen a community for another product that was so proactive towards other users in any case. I am carrying out my third project today, and Tableau is always in my tool bag."

Members earn points to redeem with various major airlines and other select retailers. In video one, Noemi Hernandez, Customer Experience Manager discusses how they can pull data from their Oracle database and bring it into Tableau. With Tableau, Club Premier no longer spends hours getting indicators. Users can now view information with the click of the button and securely share data using Tableau Server. In video 2, Noemi describes how their partner, ReSolt is helping them grow their implementation beyond commercial areas. Club Premier started within the retail branch to help partners visualize their profitability. With help from ReSolt, they have expanded Tableau to four business areas, with plans to move into all departments. Tableau: What prompted you to check out Tableau? Noemi Hernandez, Customer Experience Manager: We are Club Premier; we have more than 100 different affiliates and giving these partners added value was very important to us, where they could come in and see each of the metrics we have set up, and we have come to have a business relationship with them. So it is very important for us that all the metrics and indicators that we handle in the company can be shared both at different levels and with our partners. Tableau: What factors are important to you in a business intelligence solution? Noemi: It was important for us to have an integrated source of information and be able to use it and make different indicators and markers that would already be validated beforehand by their corresponding areas. Tableau: What data do you analyze in Tableau? Noemi: As regards to sources of information, we currently connect Tableau to an Oracle database where we have concentrated as much information as possible about the transactions of each of our partners. Tableau: What challenges were you facing before Tableau? Noemi: Basically, speed is an important point. I mean, talking about the other kinds of tools people had, they were taking up to four hours to get an indicator each week. That's four working hours that you are paying your people for which with Tableau we're getting with one click. Tableau: What other benefits have you experienced? Noemi: On the other hand, what we have seen with Tableau as an improvement has a lot to do with what we have talked about in terms of the integrity of the information. In other words, now we can know that the information that is being shown, both to the partner as well as to senior management, is information that has already been validated by the areas of business intelligence. Another point is the level of security that Tableau gives us. Information had previously been handled through e-mails; we would talk through text files. The level of security that gives us in this case, where I am on the side of systems, is very important, especially because the information is no longer going around just anywhere, but it has to pass through a flow. We have clear processes for the approval of information within Tableau and that has supported us a lot to know that we're in a good place and we have the information where it should be. It involves an initial investment, which is the development of the dashboards, but in the end all the support of having the information right there at hand and right when it is needed is a great advantage that we have received with Tableau. Tableau: Can you talk about your partner network? Noemi: On the issue of volume, we were saying that Club Premier is a company that has more than 100 affiliates and more than 3 million customers. So for the same reason this crosschecking of information takes us to a very detailed level of accumulation and redemption for each of our partners within each of the partners. In addition to this, we have partners that are the retail branch that send us information to the SKU level. So for us, information is extremely important and the volume of information is very, very heavy. Both comparing us as a company and with retail. Tableau: Which departments use Tableau? Noemi: Initially it began with an area that in this case is retail. The objective of this area is to see what the movement is for each of the partners and what is the profitability for each of our partners. That is why we started with that business. But the goal of having Tableau is to start with all the commercial areas. We already have four of our business areas within Tableau now, and the objective is not only that the commercial areas use it, but that our back areas can use it also. Tableau: What were some keys to the success of your deployment? Noemi: Implementation began basically with the ReSolt team and from our side, having two people dedicated to the part of supporting this consultancy firm and with business areas that we started, so it was with three or four retail people, and on the air side, seeing that Aerom\u00e9xico is our biggest partner. We finally concluded from this evaluation process that both Tableau and ReSolt were the tools that would be able to help us with implementation and meeting these business needs. So much training they had, both in requirements gathering and in dashboard development, they were our right-hand in the implementation of this entire project. Tableau: Where do you think your company would be without Tableau? Noemi: Where would we be? Well, quite simply, going crazy in the company, right?"

And they can be presented in such a dynamic and agile way that the user doesn't feel like there's so much information. Tableau: Why did you decide to try Tableau? Rosario: We tried Tableau because we needed to fulfill the organization's different decision-making needs in a quick, agile, and flexible way. Tableau: Before Tableau, what challenges were you facing? Rosario: When presenting information at a managerial level, when we were trying to analyze information involving a large quantity of variables and create executive presentations, we had to reduce the number of variables for the presentation. The more we reduced the variables to be presented, the more we needed support to answer these questions. The amount of information to deliver and have information at zone (or region) and campuses (or school) levels, to be able to give an answer, kept growing. What we found was that it became information that people didn't use. Why? Because there would be so many slides that people didn't have time to analyze the information; they got lost in the huge number of graphics presented. Tableau: How has Tableau helped you? Rosario: With Tableau, I no longer have to worry about the quantity of information to manage. We can access the information we need in such a natural, intuitive way; even the most detailed information required by users. There's really no comparison. Tableau: How have your colleagues responded to Tableau? Rosario: The managers often ended up saying: so when are we going to get access to this tool? I want all my people to have access. My users' needs have also grown; they'll no longer settle for any other tool. Now they want quick answers, they want detail; there's no turning back. There was something about seeing their data in Tableau that didn't go unnoticed. I went into the meeting with their information in Tableau and people automatically started to pay more attention. As for financial information, Tableau created unique displays for us that had never been seen before in the organization."

And with Tableau, the team works off of a single source of truth, leading to better accuracy and collaboration. Tableau: How much data do you typically analyze? Guillermo Martinez Ceballos, Financial Reporting Manager: The current volume that we have from Nacional Financiera, we are talking about 30 million records because we have a history of approximately 15 years; we have a data warehouse that has allowed us to continue storing historical information. Tableau: What departments use Tableau? Guillermo: So the main areas that need to share information in the final analysis is our leadership in the area of planning and financial programming, with different areas of marketing, promotion, and accounting analysis. [Also in] financial information where we coordinate which information will be useful to the institution. In the end, with all of us working together, we know how to arrive at the same figure, even though we perform different analyses. Tableau: Can you share an example of how you use Tableau? Guillermo: Since we are a financial institution, we have to be monitoring the goals\u2014the indicators that we have forecast for each year\u2014and monitor these on a monthly basis to ensure that we are vigilant. They have made dashboards where we compare the information we have against the information programmed in order to see whether we are complying or if we are late with the information in respect to fulfilling the targets for each of the different business areas. Tableau: How has Tableau influenced your work? Guillermo: Tableau has allowed us to have access to the information 24 hours in advance, which allows us\u2014with both the executive reports and the analysis reports that they make\u2014to look forward to see whether there are any incidents for the monthly closures. This enables everyone to see, analyze their perspectives, view their incidents, and be able to improve for the next month and meet the annual target. Tableau: What would your reporting process look like if you didn\u2019t have Tableau? Guillermo: If we didn't have Tableau, what we would be doing now, rather, what the people who prepare and consult the reports would be doing now is waiting for the operational areas to compile them, which takes 10 to 15 days or up to a month to obtain the information."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Founded in 1969, the University of Bielefeld today boasts 13 faculties with a total of roughly 24,000 students. Prof. Dr. Ralf E. Ulrich is heading up the Institute for Population and Health Research at the School of Public Health. His research focuses on human population sizes, structures (age, sex, nationality), and their variances over time. Prof. Ulrich uses Tableau in his teaching projects for a variety of visualizations of demographic data. He also teaches Tableau in a number of courses\u2014allowing students to dig deeper into demographic data. Prof. Ulrich describes how \u2014 using Tableau \u2014 students discovered demographic details that were previously unknown in the community. Tableau: Tell us a little about yourself. Prof. Ralf Ulrich, Professor of Social Studies: I\u2019m Ralf Ulrich. I teach demography and health at Bielefeld University and in this job I have to deal with huge data sets and my students, some of them at least, in their future careers, too. So that\u2019s how I came to Tableau. Tableau: How did you first learn about Tableau? Prof. Ulrich: It must have been around 2011 that I found a link on an Excel forum to Tableau and I went to the Tableau website and downloaded a trial and I noticed also an interesting video from an American automobile club. And learned for myself that there is a similarity between this automobile club and the health industry. Because in both huge amounts of data are produced by processes and this data is only partly used for value. And Tableau could have been a tool to make more of that. Tableau: Why did you choose to use Tableau in your courses? Prof. Ulrich: I tried Tableau myself and found it quite easy to learn and I learned also that I can analyze huge data sets in a short time. I always have some students who are interested to go beyond Excel and beyond SPSS. And so I decided to offer a course on Tableau. Tableau: How do you use Tableau in your courses? Prof. Ulrich: Actually, I use Tableau in three different ways. One way is a summer course centered around and focused on Tableau, where a group of 15 to 20 students learn to create dashboards, to analyze data sets. And at the end of each course they produce a presentation that they upload to Tableau Public. Secondly, each winter, I have a lecture on demography and health and I use Tableau to produce about 10 files, which I uploaded to Tableau Public. My students can interact with demographic data as data customers. With this demographic data lab, that\u2019s how we call it, they get much deeper into the demographic data and they can answer the questions I post in the lecture, but also the questions they have themselves to the data. There is a third area where we use Tableau and that\u2019s in so called project seminars. One project was about delirium patients in the Bielefeld hospital. And the students \u2013 with the help of Tableau and without any previous knowledge of Tableau \u2013 were able to identify the specific characteristics, the demography, of delirium patients. They found out that they are much less geographically dispersed as other patients in the Bielefeld hospital. And the management of the hospital invited us to present these results they had not known, before. Tableau: What are the benefits of using Tableau in your courses? Prof. Ulrich: The biggest benefit of using Tableau in courses is that students get acquainted with Business Intelligence. So by learning this already at the Bielefeld University our students get an advantage compared to other students and they might be able to apply this knowledge in their later careers. Besides administrative hurdles, the biggest hurdle was to get the students beyond the very first euphoria with Tableau. In the very beginning \u2013 it\u2019s like game and toy, and lots of colors and everything \u2013 so the challenge is to bring them beyond that point and motivate them to learn much more difficult things like the art of filtering or other things. Tableau: What type of feedback do you receive from your students? Prof. Ulrich: Students like these courses very much. And I get a lot of questions if it will be offered next year again. Tableau: Did you notice any major difference in your course since you started teaching Tableau? Prof. Ulrich: I got deeper into intricacies of Tableau. And this enabled me to adjust methodology how I teach it and also, after a few years of teaching it, I got experience what are the difficulties for the students. So it might take two or three years of teaching Tableau to reach a certain point where you actually understand better the learning process. Tableau: Would you recommend Tableau to other teachers? Prof. Ulrich: Tableau pulls the interest of students from the beginning. They experience fast progress, which is very stimulating for them and for the teacher. In the beginning, students try to apply the approach they learned for Excel to Tableau. That does not work well and can lead to some frustrations. One important thing to learn to do things the Tableau way. That is an important step. Also some of my students misunderstood Tableau in the beginning as a visualization program. Now I take more time in the beginning to explain the type of animal Tableau is. Tableau: How do you leverage the Tableau academics programs (Tableau for Teaching and Tableau for Students)? Prof. Ulrich: The colleagues from Tableau Academic Program staff supplied us with license keys for our computer pool and with license keys for each individual student, so that the students could continue learning Tableau at home. I also appreciate that students after completing my course can continue to use student licenses. And in some cases I could observe students using Tableau for their Master thesis."

Approximately 100 hotels of all sizes use a cloud-based hetras solution. Within hetras, hoteliers and hotel revenue managers use Tableau to analyze bookings and set room rates based on demand. Today, hotels can adjust their pricing multiple times a day and quickly analyze impact. Tableau: Who is hetras? What are you offering and who is your target audience? Philipp von Ditfurth, CEO: My name is Philipp von Ditfurth. I am CEO of hetras, a cloud-based hotel management software. Our customers are hoteliers or hotel revenue managers, who set the room rates on a day by day basis. Tableau: Which Tableau products are you using and what for? Philipp von Ditfurth: We are using Tableau Desktop and Tableau Cloud to visualize data through the web. There are roughly 100 hotels that employ our solutions. For each hotel there are 5 to 10 people working with our data specifically. Hotel revenue managers are using Tableau for their everyday work. They analyze all past and future bookings in order to make the right decisions when setting room rates. Tableau has become a staple in the daily routine of our customers. Tableau: What do you like about Tableau? Philipp von Ditfurth: Tableau really made an impression by being very easy to learn. It just works very intuitively. Tableau: What are the essential advantages of Tableau? Philipp von Ditfurth: At the same time, the combination of Tableau Desktop and Tableau Cloud gives us the ability to easily integrate Tableau with our cloud based products. Last but not least it\u2019s simply the performance. We decided to go with Tableau because it allows us to switch seamlessly. And thanks to Tableau\u2019s system partner we were able to very quickly deliver on the wishes and requirements of our customers. Tableau: What impact has Tableau had on your customers\u2019 day to day work? Philipp von Ditfurth: For similar analyses, multiple hotel staff had to work in huge Excel files, often for several days. And since this sort of information is required daily, it was a lot of work. Now with Tableau, the data is prepared and ready at the touch of a button. What used to take hours of tedious work is now instantly available at any time. This means hotels are now able to adjust their pricing not just once, but multiple times per day and directly impact the hotel revenue. By seamlessly integrating Tableau into our own cloud-based product, we are able to deliver higher quality services. Users have direct access to their data without ever switching systems in order to analyze data for their core tasks. Everything is available right in the product, making daily work a lot more efficient. Tableau: What are your plans for the future? Philipp von Ditfurth: We started by making Tableau available to our customers in the form of Tableau Cloud. The next step was to integrate Tableau into our own solution. This is the general direction we\u2019re moving in. We want to integrate Tableau even deeper into our product and, by doing so, deliver new and better services to our customers."

And with Tableau Cloud, teams can share insights across the company. With faster access to data, Rebelle has optimized production, cutting lead times in half. The company also allocates resources better, which doubled total output. Country managers now have live, country-specific dashboards to track metrics. And this is just the beginning. As Rebelle expands through Europe, Stefan Schliek, Head of Controlling & BI, is confident that Tableau will scale with the growing business and its growing data. Tableau: Tell us about Rebelle. Stefan Schliek, Head of Controlling and BI: Rebelle is an online marketplace for second-hand designer women\u2019s fashion. People can buy and sell women\u2019s fashion through us. We provide the platform and handle the entire process. Tableau: Can you share how Rebelle uses Tableau? What data sources do you connect to? Stefan Schliek: We use Tableau Desktop to generate and build reports, which we then deploy using Tableau Cloud. We use Tableau on a daily basis in all departments, from accounting to marketing. In those departments we mainly use our own Amazon Redshift data warehouse as data source and blend with data from Google Analytics. Tableau: How satisfied are your users? Stefan Schliek: Our users are generally very satisfied. They can use the tools with complete autonomy, allowing them to ask new questions and receive answers very quickly. We also receive feedback on how they use it. Often they just want to surpass their own achievement from yesterday. Tableau: What benefit has the solution brought to your organization? Stefan Schliek: We\u2019ve seen significant improvements throughout the department. And the time we save, we can throw at other projects and progress faster as a company. For instance, we\u2019ve optimized lead times in production, almost cutting them in half. At the same time, we\u2019ve almost doubled our total output due to improved employee and resource allocation. Tableau: What was your BI solution before Tableau? Stefan Schliek: Originally, we did our reporting in Excel, just like many others did and probably still do. But we simply reached the limits of Excel with regards to speed and data volume. And that is where Tableau really shines. We evaluated practically all the products leading in the Gartner report. With Tableau, I feel like I will be able to do things in the future that I can\u2019t even fathom today. At the same time we were very confident in the future development of Tableau, and it\u2019s just a fact that you need a reliable partner who can keep up with the pace of technological progress. Tableau: What is the outlook for the future? Stefan Schliek: We are expanding throughout Europe and hiring country managers. These country managers are now also provided with live data they can access, work with, and base their decisions on - completely independent from our Hamburg headquarters. That is just one of our next steps. I am curious myself to see what else is coming. But whatever it is, I am confident we can do it with Tableau. Tableau: From your perspective, are there any other key aspects for which you'd recommend Tableau? Stefan Schliek: We realized that most questions could be answered by the Tableau Community. And for those that couldn\u2019t, well, we are lucky enough to have The Information Lab literally just around the corner. And we were also very happy with the Tableau helpdesk itself. So, we\u2019re not just feeling good about Tableau, but also about the entire landscape around it. There really is a system in place that allows you to scale up. And I\u2019ve never seen a better product documentation either. All in all I am delighted. We were also very happy that Tableau now has a data center in Dublin. Having servers in Europe instead of the United States is an important criterion with regards to data security."

        "company": "Skyscanner",
        "content": "Skyscanner is a leading global travel search site, used by 50 million people every month to plan and book flight, hotel, and car hire options. Founded in 2003, the company\u2019s products are available in more than 30 languages and 70 currencies. Skyscanner turned to Tableau to deliver insights and share them quickly and easily across the business. Multidisciplinary teams can quickly identify trends and analyze web traffic data to help design sales and marketing campaigns, grow revenue, and increase brand loyalty. Today, answers to questions such as, \u2018Is the traveler planning their next trip, just returning, or looking for inspiration on where to go?\u2019 are just a few clicks away. Skyscanner is flying high\u2014but believes it can fly even higher. Skyscanner has a highly successful travel search product and loyal global customer base, in a fast-paced, ever-changing environment. According to Mark Shilton, Principal Analyst at Skyscanner, \u201cWe were quickly outgrowing our old data models, so we set about changing that.\u201d The outcome was the development of Squads and Tribes: groups of individuals coming together from cross-functional teams like marketing, commercial, product engineering, and other Skyscanner departments to innovate new ideas that help grow the business. For these Tribes to thrive, Skyscanner needed to become a more data-driven organization, with results calculated using business-relevant metrics. Until recently, however, the organization relied on a dedicated business intelligence (BI) department, tasked to deliver the analytics needed for decision-making. The BI team would source data from the company\u2019s SQL Server data warehouse, and ultimately delivered the data to teams using Excel spreadsheets. As the business grew, Tribes had overwhelming volumes of data, ranging from web traffic to flight schedules and marketing campaign data\u2014all buried in tens of thousands of spreadsheet rows. As a result, Tribes often overlooked important details. And the inflexible nature of spreadsheets meant that they couldn\u2019t efficiently test hypotheses or react to new market opportunities. This issue was prevalent in marketing campaign management. Each campaign came with a new spreadsheet. People would manually pull data, \u2018copying and pasting\u2019 the data that was relevant to them, leading to inaccurate reporting. Skyscanner\u2019s leadership also identified an opportunity to offer insights from the data they collect to business-to-business (B2B) partners, like airports, hotels, and car hire companies through the Skyscanner for Business Insights service. Partners use the data to gain insight into customers\u2019 travel habits and plan for demand. For example, a hotel chain might mine the data to discover how many customers are browsing flights to Rome or Athens, increasing room capacity in these destinations with demand. Providing interactive dashboards via Tableau Server allows partners to dive deeper into the data. To start, Shilton and his team trialed Tableau Cloud. \u201cTableau Cloud gave us a quick way to learn more about the technology, without getting involved in any complex set-up. In a few hours, with no training, we could create our own dashboards, drill down instantly into the data, and edit views,\u201d he says. After evaluating several other vendors, they quickly found that Tableau best suited their needs. Shilton said, \u201cCompared with solutions from Microstrategy and Qlik, Tableau is more flexible and easy to use. It allows us to be agile and experimental; to share ideas at the click of a mouse.\u201d Skyscanner opted to purchase Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server. In Tableau, teams can connect directly to their data stored in Amazon Redshift. This solution provides a flexible, scalable data architecture alongside powerful visual analytics. \u201cWe can spin up an Amazon Redshift cluster very easily; there\u2019s no need to buy or administer any servers,\u201d says Shilton. \u201cWhen a dashboard is published to Tableau Server, the Tribes can access it securely from any browser or mobile device. We even track and monitor the monthly cost of the Amazon environment in Tableau.\u201d Skyscanner also uses Google BigQuery with Tableau and Python. \u201cWhile in the past it was tricky to get a fully unsampled report based on specific segments of users flowing directly from Google Analytics Premium into a Tableau dashboard, now it is simply a matter of writing the query, creating a connection in Tableau to automatically refresh the data daily, and publishing this dashboard to the rest of the company.\u201d The company accesses free training videos, live online training, and the Tableau community forums to answer questions and develop their Tableau skills. Today, Skyscanner uses a self-service analytics model. Many of Skyscanner\u2019s staff of 800 relies on Tableau to conduct their own analysis and guide decision making, relying on a small team of data engineers for data preparation and quality control and freeing up more time for data scientists to concentrate on more complex, higher value work. Skyscanner benefits from enhanced travel intelligence\u2014sharing insights across the business in record time. The company now has easier access to analytics around campaign success, ROI, and forecasting. Shilton commented, \u201cBy teaching everyone how to handle data in the tools they\u2019re familiar with, you\u2019ll move the focus of their questions. People would previously ask, \u201cCan you put this in a dashboard for me?\u201d Now they ask, \u201cWhere can I get the data I need?\u201d Opportunities for growth: With Tableau, Skyscanner\u2019s Growth teams can easily track the performance of their campaigns and experiments, getting top-level performance metrics and easily drilling down to specifics. This enables the organization to fine-tune their growth efforts in a truly agile way in line with Skyscanner\u2019s working methods. With scheduled refreshes in Tableau Server, teams work off of current data for accurate forecasting. Instead of spending several hours a week compiling data, leadership now has the data they need, when they need it. Within Skyscanner\u2019s Wi-Fi sponsorship program, the Growth Tribe compared activated Skyscanner customers against their Wi-Fi use in particular airports. The Tribe uses this data to determine the program\u2019s return on investment. \u201cThis instant analysis means we can be more agile as an organization, moving more quickly to capitalize on market opportunities,\u201d says Shilton. Strengthening partnerships: Today, the business partners team uses Tableau to capitalize on new opportunities. For example, the Travel Insight Service presents partners with trends, insights, and forecasts. Partners use this powerful analysis to plan route development, manage fleet/revenue, fine-tune destination marketing, and make other day-to-day trading decisions. This data is also geo-tagged, allowing partners to map their data in Tableau. Partners like airlines, can understand search behavior and identify why they might be losing passengers to a competitor. This information helps them craft the boundaries of their operations and plan marketing campaigns more efficiently. Shilton and his team are also impressed by the new features in Tableau 10. \u201cTableau 10 is a great step forward. We really like the new dashboard functionality, for instance. We now have the flexibility to design and customize the way a dashboard appears on phones, tablets, and PCs. Plus we can publish a single dashboard to Tableau Server and it automatically optimizes interaction with whichever device the customer uses. Web-dashboard authoring is another great feature: enabling anyone at Skyscanner to create dashboards from scratch on the web, then share the intelligence,\u201d says Shilton. He concludes, \u201cTableau is an important tool for Skyscanner. It is used across the organization every day and greatly contributes to data decision making.\u201d"

Michael explains, \u201cIf you imagine that something could be done then it's very likely that Tableau will be able to do it.\u201d Tableau: What drove you to bring Tableau into your classroom? Michael Brightman, Lecturer in Economics: As an economist I'm interested in numbers. But numbers need a context and we need to understand what the number actually means. We need to be able to visualize what data is showing us. And so I needed a tool that enabled me to look at the data and for me to discover the stories within it without the background knowledge of computer science. And Tableau's functionality in that respect is ideal not just for me, but for the students whom I teach and I would suggest for other academics, as well. Tableau: Has the program been successful? Michael: What I say to my students is if you imagine that something actually could be done then it's very likely that Tableau will be able to do it. With large data sets often the story itself is not obvious. But because of the ease of use and the speed at which Tableau operates, it's possible to search for a story in the data, just by clicking a different visualizations and drilling down to different levels. Tableau: What are your thoughts about the Tableau academic programs? Michael: I'm very grateful for the benefits that Tableau for Teaching gives my students and the courses which I operate. For the student, it gives them a cost-free introduction to Tableau, which they're able to use at home. And therefore, for them to have a copy that's available for their home PC or laptop is invaluable. My thought process is I'm not selling Tableau to my students to take to their colleagues. What I'm selling is the university, because if those students go into their company and because of that they use Tableau, I've sold the university, because that insight came from my teaching."

Tableau: How satisfied are your users? Dr. H\u00fcdig: It\u2019s always really nice to see how people receive this when they see how they can interact with the data themselves. Tableau: What benefits has the solution brought to your organization? Dr. H\u00fcdig: It enables new insights and that is much more powerful than what we used to have when there was very little interaction. We try to anticipate what they may be looking for to solve their own problem and to hence create an offering which enables them to pursue those questions. We looked at 1,200 companies. We have 177,000 data points and we are basically instantly able to produce a very specific cut on each of the industries we observe. We can do things that were just simply not possible before. Dr. H\u00fcdig: When you get data\u2014once you have done it for an hour, structured the data, put it into the tool\u2014you are instantly able to create a story that normally would have taken probably three, four people, and a week or two to come up with, all the way from data collection to having it in a stable PowerPoint deliverable or slide. It\u2019s also the benefit of automation. You have automatic data feeds going in and enhancing. You can update the data quite frequently without having to re-present everything again, and it\u2019s instantly available."

I'd say it was the tool that I'd been looking for to see my data multi-dimensionally and aggregate it rapidly. Tableau: Give an example of how Tableau helps you see and understand your data. Antonio: This flow cytometry data is unique because we are analyzing the cells of an organism one by one. When we have an individual, a sample, we analyze, for example, 1 million cells. This means an analysis of 1 million lines. If we visualize this data in an Excel file, for example, we have something like thirty or forty parameters for each line. This is an enormous quantity of multi-dimensional data. Antonio: Tableau allows the user to create filters and visualize the data in a simple way. Moreover, as I have already described, it is a sample. It is clear that we don\u2019t have a single sample; we have many samples associated with many individuals and multiple groups of individuals, who, for example, are suffering from various diseases. Tableau: What has changed in your workflow since you started using Tableau? Antonio: In our industry, we often raise a question and then say, \"OK, in order to resolve this issue, I need to recover all of my data as well as filter and process it.\" This is when we ask ourselves, \"Is this question worth the trouble of two or three hours of work?\" And sometimes we say, \"OK, well, I\u2019m going to put this question aside.\" With Tableau, in contrast, I don't have this problem anymore. If I have a question, I can address it right away. Even if the question is of lesser importance with only a slight chance of success, I can visualize it immediately. Tableau: How have your colleagues received your work in Tableau? Antonio: In general, our data analyses are rather impressive for our partners (colleagues). Many people approach us to carry out analyses with Tableau and our system of organizing multi-dimensional data. As a result, the CEA started out with my license and now we have more than twenty licenses. We are in the process of rolling out Tableau to all of our departments, which means more than a hundred users. And there are many laboratories working with us, collaborators with whom we intend to use Tableau, so the number of licenses is sure to grow.As a result, the CEA started out with my license and now we have more than twenty licenses.

With more than 90 print and online/mobile publications, the company has a net reach of almost 90% in Germany. After evaluating SAS, QlikView and Oracle, Bj\u00f6rn Leffler, Team Lead, Systems and Projects in the commercial department, explains that the company chose Tableau because \u201cit enables you to see things you never saw before.\u201d With Tableau, Media Impact\u2019s service cost center reporting that used to take two days, now takes about 30 minutes\u2014reducing effort by roughly 95%. Media Impact also uses Tableau to analyze the profitability, popularity, and customer resonance of ad formats and placements to optimize their online campaigns. Due to project success, Media Impacts continues to automate processes. Bj\u00f6rn shared a goal to \u201cnot send out reports, but give users access to data\u201d through Tableau dashboards. Tableau: Can you share some details about Media Impact? Bj\u00f6rn Leffler, Team Lead, Systems and Projects: Media Impact is a joint venture by Axel Springer SE and Funke Mediengruppe. We are advertising marketers, marketing ad space in print and online media that is published by Springer and Funke, as well as third-party clients. Tableau: How do you use Tableau on an everyday basis? Bj\u00f6rn Leffler: At the moment, we have 100 to 120 users. Tableau is used for cost service center reporting. We also drill down into our digital marketing efforts. We are looking at our advertising formats, which ones are most profitable, which ones aren\u2019t, and what products are the most popular with our customers. For that, we are using Tableau in combination with Alteryx. And finally, we use Tableau for traditional revenue controlling, analyzing our sales regions and marketing sectors. Our data sources are an SAP SD system, SAP R3 and Smart Ad Server, which controls our campaigns. Especially in Yield Management we use Alteryx to get our data from the Smart Ad Server and SAP SD into Tableau. Tableau: How satisfied are your users? Bj\u00f6rn Leffler: Our users are very satisfied with Tableau. As soon as they see how easy it is, how good it looks and what you can do with mouse overs and filtering, people are blown away. So yeah, they are very happy and we are getting really positive feedback from the departments. Tableau: What benefits has the Tableau + Alteryx solution brought to your organization? Bj\u00f6rn Leffler: Now we are using modern technology that is developed dynamically. And of course we are saving a lot of time. We\u2019ve set up service cost center reporting with Tableau. That used to take two days, now we are doing it in 30 to 60 minutes. That is an enormous amount of time saved. And that\u2019s actually our goal: to automate processes and not send out reports, but give our users access to data that is currently coming to their inbox as a report on a weekly basis. We want them to be able to access current data every day. What we pull from the systems is business data and financial data. And we always have planning and forecasting data which is only available in Excel. With Tableau we can just add these and have access to everything in one interface. That is the big advantage of Tableau. Tableau: What was your business intelligence solution before Tableau? Why did you choose Tableau? Bj\u00f6rn Leffler: Initially we had a really old system.\nWe looked at SAS, QlikView and Oracle. But we decided to go with Tableau because it is innovative. It enables you to see things you never saw before. There are visualization types we never even thought of before. It\u2019s an amazingly powerful tool. Tableau: What are your next steps? Bj\u00f6rn Leffler: Our next big step is to deploy a management summary for our executives. That will mainly be the big picture revenue reporting at first. But we are going to migrate our entire reporting to Tableau. I think training is an important factor, and Tableau offers resources right on their website. You can learn a lot without having to book a two or three day course. We wish other suppliers would offer that. Of course, things are always moving forward and there are new developments. We like to be kept in the loop about these things. What are the new possibilities? There is always something interesting or downright important happening. And Tableau is doing that."

With Tableau, Founder, Beatrice Loriot can combine data from marketing, sales and finance into a single view, optimizing decision making and fostering collaboration between Sales and Marketing. When B\u00e9atrice explains her experience she said, \u201c[This] thoroughly convinced me that Tableau was the tool for my company.\u201d Tableau: How does Tableau help measure marketing performance? B\u00e9atrice Loriot, Fondatrice, B\u00e9autiful Numbers: We demand more and more marketers to generate more opportunities with less budget. Even with less budget, Tableau is a valuable management tool. In the same dashboard, marketing departments can analyze campaign performance, budget, and return on investment. They can also keep track of the pipeline, marketing opportunities, and associated conversion rates. They can access this data on the fly to help achieve objectives and implement corrective action as necessary. B\u00e9atrice: Dashboards help demonstrate marketing's contribution to the business. They help marketing teams gain credibility with sales and finance departments, ensure proper alignment, and motivate marketers when they see the results of their efforts displayed before their eyes. My clients want to connect to their existing data sources: Salesforce, Google Analytics, Marketo, Oracle, Excel, etc. This involves a lot of data processing, which can be tedious and prone to error\u2014which would be disastrous for the client's credibility. Tableau connects natively to these data sources, which allows me to offer my clients relevant analyses to drive business performance of their choice, including SEO, website, campaigns, and budget. Tableau : How would you describe your Tableau experience? B\u00e9atrice : There is much talk today about the possibility to go shopping, because everything can be bought online ... Fortunately, such a vision is still far from reality and trade are critical to guide the choices of customers. I was accompanied throughout the decision process and I have access to different information and resources. At no time have I felt myself \"a small client\" given the size of my company and I got the impression of always belong to the great iconic groups of IT where I worked previously. Tableau : In your opinion, what is one of Tableau\u2019s big strengths? B\u00e9atrice : I conducted tests with all tools available, and actually, the great strength of Tableau is the combination of its community, its sales representatives, all the tools it offers, and its tutorials. After some training, I am now a daily user of Tableau Desktop, but with Tableau, you are never done learning because the possibilities are endless. So when I imagine something new or just when I have a doubt, I turn to the forum or the support and I made sure to get a response. In addition, all of this is extremely ease of use. It's almost a pleasure to have a question! Finally, the user experience is extraordinary. Sometimes I want to save time by contacting Tableau employees that I meet on events, and they always respond with professionalism and a smile."

In less than half a day, Heon had several dashboards that were ready for customers\u2019 use. Today, instead of coding custom maps, Heon can create maps by simply dragging and dropping regional fields in Tableau. When Liliana Quintero Cardozo, Director, Business Intelligence speaks to Tableau\u2019s impact on the company, she describes Tableau as being \u201cthe best decision we could make.\u201d Tableau: Why did you purchase Tableau instead of building your own tool? Liliana Quintero Cardozo, Director, Business Intelligence: We were facing a problem; several in fact, that led us to implement Tableau in the organization. One of them was speed. We would have to do a lot of backward development, a huge number of steps in which we spent far too much time to deliver a finished product that was in line with customer needs. So there were many things we realized. Tableau was the best decision we could make because there were many gaps we were unaware of. Tableau: Can you share an example of something you achieved with Tableau? Liliana: The first proof of concept that we did was to identify the accident rate, which is extremely important for a health organization that is reviewing cost versus income. What we did was to conduct this proof of concept by identifying the accident rate at the national level, by region, and for each of the departments, municipalities, through to the IPS level. By identifying this accident rate, which we had not been able to do using other tools, we went a step further and set out to conduct a proof of concept with special programs in which we evaluated diseases, such as HIV, cancer and hemophilia. Tableau: How did you do this? Liliana: We did this through maps of Colombia, which we had not been able to achieve before either. When we made our first maps of Colombia prior to having Tableau, it was very complicated because we almost had to draw the map. Tableau: How did Tableau streamline your mapping process? Liliana: With Tableau the map is already set up, the geography was ready and it was very simple to identify where the highest cost of these complicated diseases were concentrated at a regional level, and the implementation. Seeing as though we did this so quickly, we launched the third step, which was to make the data top level. We identified all this information and implemented it in no more than half a day with the help of our partner, Tableau. We sat down and said, \u201chere is the tool, use it, fill out the tables with the sources of information.\u201d That morning, IT from 8 am to 12 noon, one of my analysts already had many dashboards ready. Obviously in all my years of work, I never imagined it could be so fast. Tableau: What other benefits have you experienced with Tableau? Liliana: Tableau responded and exceeded our expectations. Most importantly was the financial part; when we were offered Tableau we said to ourselves that this must be worth a lot of money. We were actually surprised by the cost. We made a decision table. The cost was much lower than what we had budgeted with other suppliers of business intelligence tools."

Looking back, he claims that a Tableau dashboard helped land him the opportunity. Fast forward to today\u2014Jonathan is an elite Tableau user, working on high-profile projects for Synaltic Group and creating influential vizzes for the Tableau Public community. Even after Jonathan became a Tableau Visionary in 2015, he says that he continues to learn new Tableau skills every day. Tableau: How did you get started with Tableau? Jonathan Trajkovic, Data Analyst, Synaltic Group: Tableau allowed me to land my first position; in fact, it\u2019s quite a funny story. When I did my Master's, I wanted to do Chemistry and Project Management at the same time. It was kind of my goal; I came from a background of \"pure research\" chemistry, and I wanted to join a company. I couldn\u2019t find any internships in the Paris region or anywhere else in France. It was rather difficult, a rather tight market. When I did my project report, I submitted my first dashboard (made with Tableau), and my then boss, who was also a professor at the time, told me, \"If you are interested, we can find an internship for you here.\" I thought it over for a long time and two to three weeks before the start of the internship I wound up going to see him and having the interview. I began the internship with them in February, and in August I signed my permanent employment contract. So, it went quite well, and I believe that it is thanks to Tableau that I was given that opportunity. Tableau: You\u2019ve done a lot of Tableau projects for clients. Which projects were the most impactful for you? Jonathan: The client that left the biggest mark on me was the French Red Cross, the first client that I supported. That was where I learned the most: how to do SQL queries, how a database is structured, and my first large dashboards; that was also with that client. I continue to learn from them because we still support them, and we are on other types of projects. The second client that I could cite is La Poste Courrier, because that is where I made the biggest developments. It currently involves applications that are quite technically complicated and, at the same time, it has been a huge professional challenge. Tableau: As an elite Tableau user, are you still able to learn new things in Tableau? Jonathan: With Tableau, I am always learning, every day, with all the clients I meet and all the people I work with. It is a tool with which I am beginning to become quite conversant, and, at the same time, I am always learning, because there is always something to discover. There are interesting cases with clients where I can learn little details that I had not seen in the last four years, and that can make life easier. At the same time, that also enables me to progress. That is one of the strengths of the tool, that I have not yet found any limits to it. That is something that I appreciate quite a lot: that it continues, actually, I continue to progress. Tableau: How did you become a Tableau Visionary in 2015? Jonathan: So, I have become a Tableau \"Tableau Visionary,\" I think, with the work in the community, which I have achieved on Tableau Public. As a reminder, it is an appointment, so the work has been quite long, and, at the same time, it was not sought out. That\u2019s the surprising thing; it wasn\u2019t one of my goals. I was fortunate enough to be appointed somewhere, and that involves always staying active in the community. To continue to do things that matter to people, that interest them, and that also help them: that is one of the goals. I believe that it\u2019s one of the goals that pleases me the most. It means providing help to those who are looking for answers on Tableau and continuing to do visualizations that I believe are relevant to those who are going to read them."

Tableau: What was your experience with BI solutions before Tableau? Bj\u00f6rn: I've been working with business intelligence for more than ten years, and in retrospect\u2014I was a BI dinosaur.

Bj\u00f6rn: There I was sitting with Tableau and it took me two weeks, and then I just loved it. I'd seen it before, and I liked it, but I've never been able to use it much. Tableau: How do your analysts use Tableau and what kinds of data are typical? Bj\u00f6rn: We use Tableau Cloud. We have a couple of licenses there. And then Tableau Desktop. All our data reside in Google BigQuery, both application data, as well as normalized data and data warehouse. Tableau: What did you initially think about using the cloud? Bj\u00f6rn: At Soundtrack Your Brand, all our data reside in the cloud, which was very new for me. And it's totally amazing, and I will never ever go back to not having the data in the cloud. Tableau: How has Tableau affected your work style and how analysts solve problems? Bj\u00f6rn: Now I work more with an open canvas. I can sit next to the business, show them the data that they have. They would pick up on things that I wouldn't have thought of. Many times the iteration process goes much faster with Tableau sitting next to the business."

For me, going back to anything else would be a huge step backwards.\u201d Tableau: What was your initial impression of Tableau? Romain Ferraton, CEO and Founder: When I discovered Tableau, it filled such a big gap that I put aside software that had taken me a huge amount of time to learn. In fact, there was so much to be gained in terms of speed of development and readability of reports that I switched over to this technology. Tableau: What was the situation like before Tableau? How did it improve? Romain: I had a lot of difficulty displaying mountains of data (which I do today in a clear manner), and finally extracting relevant information from them. It was difficult without Tableau. Today, I go ten times quicker with Tableau. Tableau: How has your experience evolved over time? Romain: For five years, I have used it almost daily to do performance analyses and performance audits that I conduct at my clients' offices. Today, I could no longer do without this tool. For me, going back to anything else would be a huge step backwards. Tableau: In your opinion, what is a main benefit of Tableau? Romain: In my field, I don't have a defined guiding principle. I have to analyze things as they come, because each case is different. It is therefore what one calls ad-hoc analysis, and this tool is perfect for that. Tableau: Can you talk about your client process? Romain: I go to my clients; I install probes that operate for several days, several weeks, perhaps a whole month. Then I collect and integrate this information into a database, and put Tableau into this database, where I insert it and where I do my analyses. So there you have it, that's how I use it, as a performance auditor. When I do my architectural work I use Tableau more to demonstrate the capacities of other databases that I am going to plug Tableau into. Tableau performs very well on many databases, including SAP HANA. I can show the capacities of the database with a product that is also innovative. Often \u2013 as happened last time \u2013 my client ends up wanting Tableau, while at the beginning he was heading towards a POC database. In the end, he wants both: he wants the in-memory database, but he also wants the tool to leverage it."

SVP and CIO Judy Snyder adopted Tableau \u201cfor scalability, governance, and enterprise-readiness.\u201d With Tableau, KellyOCG streamlined reporting by 10 hours per week and increased operational productivity by 25%\u2014leading to internal and partner growth. Suppliers now have fast access to analytics, encouraging innovation and \u201cdriving the collective business forward.\u201d KellyOCG manages billions of dollars of purchased labor spend on behalf of global strategic partners. Of the nearly one million open positions that the company fills each year, Kelly Services directly employs 500,000 workers; they place the rest via a global network of talent suppliers and partners. Previously, KellyOCG\u2019s client reports\u2014including annual business reviews and quarterly \u2018scorecards\u2019\u2014were static PowerPoint presentations. This quarterly pace made it difficult for suppliers to make timely changes to business processes and the static format prevented them from asking questions of the data. A few strategic customers approached KellyOCG with a request for faster, deeper insights. Internally, KellyOCG\u2019s leadership also wanted data to guide company-wide decisions. With five years\u2019 worth of this transactional data stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database along with data from Salesforce.com, vendor management systems, and Google Analytics, KellyOCG\u2019s operations manager spent 10 hours every week putting together data sets culled from up to four different reporting systems. In response, \"KellyOCG made a deliberate investment in analytics because we understood that companies lacked the insights to make decisions about the right way to use talent,\u201d said John Healy, Vice President and Managing Director of Global Talent Supply Chain for Kelly Services. \u201cWe needed a real-time delivery platform for insights,\u201d shared Tom Tisdale, Vice President of Talent Supply Chain Analytics for Kelly Services. \u201cThis platform needed to be flexible such that it would become a foundation pillar of a much more encompassing supplier enablement strategy.\u201d The analytics team turned to the Gartner Magic Quadrant, evaluating prospective solutions based on ease of use, data connections, ability to embed dashboards into web pages, and a flexible licensing model to minimize upfront capital investment. \u201cWe went through every vendor in the \u2018Leaders\u2019 segment of Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant to evaluate the right choice. Tableau came out on top,\u201d John recalled. The team worked closely with Judy Snyder, to vet their final choice. \u201cWe looked at Tableau to make sure it would meet our needs for scalability, governance, and enterprise-readiness. Tableau has been able to meet the rigor of our complex data and IT ecosystem,\u201d said Judy. Today, a core group creates visual analyses in Tableau Desktop for several audiences\u2014connecting to tables with up to 25 to 30 million rows of data. They publish dashboards to Tableau Server and embed analytics into their Center of Excellence portal as the collective analysis platform for customers, suppliers, and program teams. \u201cWith this platform, for the first time, everyone is seeing the same analysis and insights in real-time,\u201d said Richard Fisher, Director of Talent Supply Chain Analytics, KellyOCG. \u201cTableau allows us to visualize a significantly complex business problem in a way that allows our operations team, our customers, and our suppliers to make business decisions that drive their collective business forward,\u201d said John. In the early stages of Tableau, KellyOCG eliminated 10 hours per week from the previous manual reporting process\u2014a 25% improvement in operational productivity. And once a dashboard is up and running, the team can schedule it to refresh the data\u2014creating an essentially evergreen report. \u201cNow our operations manager is able to focus on more value-generating efforts,\u201d said John. With Tableau, KellyOCG accelerated their supplier scorecard pace by months\u2014leading to supplier innovation. Today, instead of delivering the scorecards each quarter, KellyOCG provides weekly insights to its suppliers. \u201cUsing predictive algorithms in Tableau, for the first time, suppliers can now determine their investment before committing to an order or a SOW and they can determine the probability of success,\u201d explained Tom. \"This is unique to KellyOCG\u2019s Managed Service Program (MSP).\" \u201cNow our suppliers have visibility into the marketplace, into their performance, and into the clients\u2019 true demands in a broader way\u2014that is leading to innovation,\u201d explained John. \u201cAs companies address the changing dynamics of the workforce, our customers have been demanding the kind of innovation that we are delivering through Tableau.\u201d Suppliers use this data to conduct market assessments, detect optimal pay rates to attract the right talent, identify the best number of sub-suppliers, along with other benchmarking efforts. Within KellyOCG, the team can forecast labor trends within a company or provide comparative analyses against other companies looking for similar employee profiles within an industry or geography. To meet European data privacy laws, all personally-identifiable information is stripped out of published analyses. \u201cThis benchmarking gives the operational teams a competitive advantage,\u201d explains Tom. \"They can now be predictive and prescriptive versus reactive with our clients.\u201d They are pleased with Tableau\u2019s advanced analytics capabilities, such as forecasting, probability analysis of outcomes, and prediction using simulation and correlation models in conjunction with Michigan State University. They also use Tableau\u2019s native R-integration for comprehensive predictive analytics. KellyOCG uses Tableau to make their business reviews more dynamic and more exciting. They simply log into the .net site and customers can review information and drill down into areas they need to understand. \u201cAt a certain point during a customer review, the formal presentation just stops and everyone gathers around the laptop looking at the dashboard. The customers are saying, \u2018What is that jump there? Why did that happen? How can we repeat it?\u2019 or \u2018I knew we were doing great over here, but I had no idea that there was a quality problem over here,\u2019\u201d said Tom. \u201cNow there is a collective realization that the stale customer review has moved from a reporting on the efficiency of the program exercise to a collaborative session on improving the effectiveness of the program\u2026..we move the discussion from what happened to what needs to happen...game changing\u201d explains Tom. Kelly Services' leadership team views analytics as a key differentiator. In early 2017, the company purchased 1200 interactor licenses on a subscription basis to continue the momentum they have already seen with Tableau. Tom Tisdale believes that the flexibility of Tableau\u2019s subscription model will enable more internal and external users to adopt Tableau quickly, rapidly scaling self-service analytics within the enterprise and across their external network of vendors and suppliers. \u201cThe ROI of the subscription model from a financial consideration, was that it provided us with the flexibility to spread the costs of licenses over 3 years versus a large upfront payment,\u201d explains Tom. \u201cIt enables us to ramp up the user populations today versus having to prove ROI to justify a large financial outlay upfront.\u201d With Tableau, the Talent Supply Chain Analytics team has transformed the way they work. \u201cOur talent is rising to the next level,\u201d said Tom. \u201cVery quickly, with Tableau, even those employees we would consider \u2018beginner\u2019 are solving very sophisticated business problems. It\u2019s enabling them to move up the training maturity growth framework faster than a traditional technology would allow.\u201d This has amplified team productivity and Tom believes that it will continue to be a recruiting advantage. \u201cWe realized very quickly then we could change the profile of the talent that we look for. We are able to move away from a technical proficiency and skills-based recruiting profile which limited the talent pool, and can now look for individuals with high energy, drive and passion\u2026What that does? It gives us rock stars.\u201d"

        "content": "La Poste transports and processes over 12 billion items per year. The company collects data on every event within the lifecycle of each item. This data influences many areas including production, client management, sales, marketing, finance, market segmentation, and more. With Tableau, La Poste discovers outliers\u2014allowing them to spot inefficiencies and optimize processes. Using Tableau mapping, La Poste tracks traffic by point of address, analyzing efficiency of mail delivery routes and transportation networks. Laurent Dabbagh, Director of Innovation and Operational Performance, explains how executives quickly saw the value in Tableau. Today, Tableau is La Poste\u2019s preferred business intelligence solution across the organization. Tableau: What data do you analyze in Tableau? Laurent Dabbagh, Director of Innovation and Operational Performance: Mail consists of over 12 billion items that are transported and processed each year. This generates 25 to 26 billion traces per year\u2014corresponding to events over the life of each of these items. It is these events that we are analyzing and whose value we have optimized thanks to Tableau. This data, originally derived from the automation of letter processing, not only comes from production but is also of value for many other players, including client management, sales, marketing for aspects of the construction of bids, and market segmentation. Also, financial management, because the exhaustiveness of the traffic makes the cost of our processes and organizations very simple to calculate; the Directorate of Safety being another example, etc. Tableau: What benefits have you experienced? Laurent: Thanks to Tableau, we have finally shown what could be called a potential value of this data\u2014which is first and foremost, production data\u2014to performers who are no longer in production. This was the winning feature of the prototype that was made with Tableau. Visuals were produced very quickly, and not only visuals, but above all, value. Behind the visual, there is value. We made our bosses understand, for example, that regarding security-of-turnover issues, the problems are as they appear Tableau: Have you had any other \u201cah-ha\u201d moments? Laurent: The trend toward the development of traffic by point of address has also been clarified. So what is behind it all poses questions for our organization with regard to mail delivery routes, transportation networks, etc. And this is done in a very visual manner. While in the background, there are tremendous amounts of information. In this respect, Tableau has been a sensational tool. Tableau: How has the company reacted to using Tableau? Laurent: The bosses quickly saw the advantage of investing in a global, industrialized solution\u2014in terms of an information system\u2014to correctly optimize the value of this information and make it available not only to a few experts at the head office (which is still the case today), but also to hundreds and even thousands of users, with Tableau as the user solution from start to finish. The snowball effect has begun, and for me that is the starting point of a successful data project. We are actually starting from a certain number of cases of use. To put it modestly, we are working on a certain number of things. Tableau: What are your plans for the future? Laurent: Afterwards, once people have understood the advantage of making the best use of this data, things come together suddenly and extremely quickly, and a trend generally gets started that will go on for years. And it is Tableau that has allowed us to do this. It is Tableau that has enabled us to correctly demonstrate the value of all the data in our information systems. In today's fast-paced world, it is necessary to move towards digitalization and cross-functionality. It is clear that Tableau takes pride of place in this type of configuration."

        "company": "image",
        "content": "Consumers enjoy PepsiCo products one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. To make sense of data from retail customers, PepsiCo adopted Tableau and reduced report production time by as much as 90%. Using Trifacta, the CPFR team wrangled disparate data, pulling it into Tableau for forecasting and analysis\u2014reducing end-to-end run time of PepsiCo\u2019s analysis by as much as 70% and report production time by as much as 90%. With faster, accurate reporting, PepsiCo has a competitive advantage in the retail space and provides best-in-class service to customers. PepsiCo\u2019s customers provide them with reports that include warehouse inventory, store inventory, and point-of-sale inventory. PepsiCo reconciles this data with their own shipment history, production numbers, and forecast data. Each customer had their own data standards, which didn't correspond with each other (let alone PepsiCo's system). For example, PepsiCo relied on UPC codes to identify each product, while customers created their own internal numbers. Wrangling this data was a challenge and reports could take months to generate. Analysts knew that their ability to quickly standardize data across all retailers\u2014and speak the same language as their customers\u2014was critical to preparing data faster for their forecasting and planning efforts. Churning out sales forecasts fast enough for management to steer the course on sales was another challenge. Each new report required the CPFR team\u2019s analysts to build a tool in Microsoft Access that combined retailers\u2019 sales data and PepsiCo supply data; a process that could take up to six months. The team primarily relied on Excel for analysis, creating large quantities of messy data. And the team had no efficient way to spot errors, leading to potentially costly outcomes. For example, a missing product from a report could result in inaccurate forecasts and lost revenue. The CPFR team needed a way to wrangle large quantities of disparate data. At the same time, the team needed a visual analysis tool that could help them make the most of PepsiCo data. To bring coherence to the data, PepsiCo turned to Tableau partner, Trifacta. For greater efficiency and scale, PepsiCo implemented Hortonworks Hadoop as a landing and staging environment for this variety of data. Now reports run directly on Hadoop, without involving multiple steps with Access and PepsiCo servers. This process allows analysts to directly manipulate data using Trifacta. Tableau provides PepsiCo with the finishing step: powerful analytics and visualizations, helping the business make sense of volumes of data. PepsiCo analysts share relevant Tableau workbooks with management over Tableau Server. The combined use of Tableau and Trifacta helps the CPFR team drive the business forward, increasing visibility into customer orders. Trifacta\u2019s visual profiling capabilities and Tableau\u2019s advanced visual analytics allow the team to easily identify gaps and get ahead of larger issues. Trifacta integrates natively with Tableau Data Extracts (TDE), allowing PepsiCo analysts to seamlessly transition between the two technologies. PepsiCo brings Tableau data extracts into Tableau Desktop, allowing them to maintain performance on big data. The combination of Trifacta\u2019s data wrangling power and Tableau\u2019s analytical depth allows PepsiCo to streamline its process. This has dramatically reduced time spent on data preparation and increased the overall quality of the data. Normalized data in Trifacta helps catch errors and flaws in the data. And with Tableau, PepsiCo can easily spot outliers and take action. If issues arise, they can correct mistakes before causing any bigger problems downstream. Performing data analysis with Tableau using Trifacta's normalized data has reduced the end-to-end run time of PepsiCo's analysis by as much as 70%. The ability to reproduce patterns makes building CPFR tools a more efficient, automated process. PepsiCo now spends less time preparing data, and more time finding insights. Mike Riegling, Supply Chain Data Analyst at PepsiCo, said, \u201cNow we\u2019re not taking our time putting the data together; we\u2019re spending our time analyzing the data, telling the story, and finding problems.\u201d Building these reports in Tableau reduces production time by as much as 90%, and visualizations that used to take up to six months to build are now ready within a day. In Tableau Desktop, PepsiCo analyzes inventory, logistical, and finance data from across the country. Bringing the data into Tableau Desktop allows PepsiCo to make sense of big data and empowers analysts to create supply chain and forecasting reports in record time. Analysts refine the data to answer questions, spot trends, and plan for future demand\u2014saving the company money. The IT department publishes TDEs to Tableau Server, encouraging collaboration between teams\u2014and enabling self-service analytics at scale. Gaining insight from customer data faster than ever has enhanced PepsiCo\u2019s process to offer its customers best-in-class service. It has also given PepsiCo a huge competitive advantage over other CPG businesses. PepsiCo can now predict trends, adjust sales, and ultimately sell more of the right product to improve their bottom line. Riegling commented, \u201cWe\u2019re able to turn customer data around and present it to the rest of our company, in a way that everyone can understand, faster than our competitors.\u201d"

Henrik F\u00e4lldin, Digital Engineer calls Tableau \u201ca key enabler\u201d to achieve their goals. Tableau: Tell us a bit about Skanska. Henrik F\u00e4lldin, Digital Engineer: So Skanska is a construction company. Head office is in Sweden. Globally, we've got about 55,000 employees. In the U.K., 5,000. We need to, you know, work with a digital mindset. We want to go from an analog way of working to a digital way of working. So digital work flows is the future. And that's where we want to head. Tableau: What prompted this change? Henrik: So one external factor is a magic number, right? 2025. The year 2025. Nine years away. The U.K. government have set targets for the construction industry, hard targets. One is reduction in carbon emission by 50 percent. Reduce cost by 33 percent, and reduce time by 50 percent. That\u2019s why we're looking at digitizing work flows. We have to do it because of those external factors. Tableau: Tell us about your old workflow. Henrik: Previously, we've worked in silos. We've got eight operating units and each has been pretty much its own company. And we've worked in silos and in Excel, et cetera. Tableau: How are things changing? Henrik: So what we want to do and what we're doing actively is removing those silos. We're collaborating across Skanska U.K. and actually across Skanska globally as well with all the business units, so that we have common data sets across all operating units. So that we have one version of the truth and we're working from the same data sets. And that's huge. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted those changes? Henrik: So what we're seeing here is a bi-directional flow of data. We're going from a macro level\u2014think of it like macro level within the company. So executives, they would review dashboards and the data with Skanska U.K., with drill-down capability. What we're actually doing is teaching people how to ask the right question and then Tableau will enable them to ask that question. We see Tableau and an enterprise environment as a key enabler for us in order to achieve our goals moving forward in order to reach those 2025 targets set by the U.K. government"

        "title": "Georgiou Group increases flow of information, improves decision making",
        "company": "Georgiou Group",
        "content": "Georgiou Group set out to consolidate data systems to bring clarity across the business, ease reporting, and enable more informed and strategic decision making. As the company expanded and the number of business intelligence indexes increased, Georgiou Group sought a new solution to improve the flow of information and provide valuable insights for all employees. At first, Georgiou Group implemented Tableau in its HR department and was later adopted by the Business Development and Productivity teams. Soon the whole company started to experience greater transparency. This resulted in the company\u2019s Advisory Board gaining new insights and correlations from the various business units, enabling the Board to make more accurate business decisions. The process is now more user friendly, efficient, and accurate because the company\u2019s data is completely integrated and centralized. After choosing Tableau, Georgiou Group has enjoyed a number of benefits including: Georgiou Group specializes in earthworks, roads and bridges, water infrastructure, precast, building construction and land development. The multi-award winning company manages between 30 - 40 different project sites across Australia at any one point in time and is growing at a steady rate. With the growth of the company came the increased need for decisions to be informed by accurate, easy-to-understand data. Due to the Company\u2019s growth, more and more data requests started to flow in and before long, reporting processes became a bottleneck. The IT team was asked to complete an increasing number of ad hoc requests for various departments. This was very time consuming\u2014and self-service was out of the question as only IT employees could use the SQL Server Reporting Services and PowerPivot data models. \u201cEvery time they wanted to add or remove a column, they were coming back to the IT team asking, \u2018Can you please add column X, Y, Z?\u2019,\u201d said Sharjeel Siddiqui, Development Team Leader at Georgiou Group. \u201cPreviously Georgiou Group had a software-development lifecycle which required a series of developments, followed by user acceptance testing, then production, so it was taking a lot of time to modify the existing reports.\u201d Finally, Georgiou Group had issues connecting its previous analytics tool, Anterra, to many of the Company\u2019s critical data sources such as Microsoft SQL and Google Analytics. For example, Georgiou Group uses a cloud-based HR System, SilkRoad HeartBeat. This system contains recruitment information, onboarding details, a talent management system, and an online learning portal. The HR team needed to analyze this data, but the system had no reporting capabilities. As a result, the IT team was required to develop these insights from scratch. As Sharjeel explains, \u201cGeorgiou Group had all this data but the reporting was primarily around finances and project costs, as opposed to the other lead indicators of profitability such as HR turnover, planning and safety. Basically, any other factor which could influence the success of the company wasn\u2019t being looked at.\u201d The Company\u2019s time-consuming data processes could be a drain on the IT team as well. \u201cWe had IT team members working until late at night, comparing spreadsheets so they could deliver the data analysis people from different departments were asking for. We wanted to achieve a situation where instead of employees coming to IT asking, \u2018Can I have a bar chart or a line chart?\u2019, they could do it themselves in five to 10 minutes.\u201d Leaders at Georgiou Group decided their first priority would be to develop a process for providing in-depth insight for the Advisory Board. As the board members had a range of experience of business intelligence, the data needed to be clear and the analytics solution easy to use. \u201cWe were asked to develop a dashboard that encompassed data from across the business. Transparency and the ability to see data clearly and accurately was essential. The dashboard had to offer a single reference point for the all information. We were looking for a quick and easy snapshot of the company.\u201d Other teams within the business were also beginning to identify a need for data analytics with responsibility falling to the IT team. Georgiou Group\u2019s leadership team visualizes data from Microsoft Dynamics CRM. The Company\u2019s property development arm was tasked with responsibility for on-time delivery and cash flow of all property projects. With this in mind, access to up-to-date, accurate data analysis was paramount to ensure clients are kept informed of the status of their property projects, while maintaining cash flow throughout the business. The Georgiou Group team came across Tableau a few years ago during a Gartner conference. At the time, Georgiou Group had been using Excel reports which were sufficient for the Company\u2019s needs. Fast-forward a couple of years and this was no longer the case. The team organized demos of two data analysis solutions: Tableau and QlikView. After a two-week \u2018bake-off,\u2019 Georgiou Group chose Tableau. Within days, one general manager had asked for more licenses so he could give his construction managers increased access. When Tableau was first introduced to the business, the IT team began to create a centralized location for data storage that allowed the various internal departments to directly connect to their individual data sources. The next step was to implement a quick process all employees could follow, no matter their level of IT expertise. Each department can use Tableau to turn their data into interactive visualizations. When the data is in this format, it is easier to share with other departments and the Advisory Board which ultimately leads to quicker, more informed business decision making. During Tableau\u2019s implementation stages at Georgiou Group, it was evident no one had realized how vital the software would become in shaping business practice and decision making in the future. Georgiou Group Chief Financial Officer Errol Keyt said, \u201cSince the implementation of Tableau almost two years ago, our business has enjoyed significant benefits. We now have access to a wide range of data from different internal departments that can be analyzed by the teams. This has driven substantial process efficiencies across the workplace. Furthermore, our decision making is now quicker and better informed by accurate, easy to understand data which has allowed the business to grow and develop further than anticipated.\u201d Not only has Tableau improved business decision making, but the company has noticed a shift in workplace attitudes in regards to data analytics. Sharjeel notes that leaders have seen a \u201cbusiness-wide shift in work flow and data management that has boosted office morale and encouraged a better work/life balance. People can develop their own reports quickly and easily, so they\u2019re not relying on others to spend many hours pulling and cutting the numbers to make charts and graphs.\u201d The introduction of Tableau has streamlined the regular board meetings enabling board members to make real-time decisions as they have all the data at their fingertips. Errol remembers, \u201cBefore Tableau, corporate information would be siloed throughout the board report, so board members would need to flick to page 45 for financial results, then back to page 10 for safety results, then onto page 20 for something else. Now the process is so much more user friendly, efficient and accurate with a one-page summary at the front of the pack.\u201d With a one-page summary, the Board is encouraged to ask more direct questions and is less confused by disparate data across the board pack. Board members and project managers can ask informed questions they may otherwise not have thought to ask. In the same way, Tableau provides transparency across the business\u2014revealing aspects of the company that are doing well and areas that they need to focus on and monitor. The data also offers a means to draw conclusions and see correlations with trends and results. Different departments report to the Board on Georgiou Group\u2019s internal safety metrics. If results are not as good as previous years, Tableau can deliver valuable insights and correlations between changes in HR turnover or unusual financial results. Sharjeel Siddiqui said, \u201cIt\u2019s an art versus science battle. Accountants can work with a 20-row table with five different columns, but how does everyone across the company utilize those insights and effectively process the information? By using Tableau, the art versus science debate can find a middle ground. The software collates the data to identify correlations, and then projects it into an easy-to-understand visual representation.\u201d Other benefits relate to individual teams within the business. HR has a centralized dashboard from which they can create their own visualizations. For example, it\u2019s now straight forward to identify the risks that could arise if there are multiple people from one project away at the same time. The HR team has visibility across various projects, broken down by job role, which allows for detailed planning in such scenarios. The HR team has also developed bespoke courses for project managers that are run through Georgiou\u2019s online learning module. This is helping Georgiou Group\u2019s project managers garner skills in new areas such as financial management, leadership, cost control, and commercial. The HR team is able to plug the attendance data from these courses into Tableau to help determine which project managers still need to attend and which courses are most suitable for each individual. The Leadership Team also has centralized dashboards to manage property development project timelines and related cash flow. This means the team is now aware at all times of the status of each development project, so if there are delays or concerns, Georgiou Group\u2019s employees are always informed."

With Tableau, the organization can identify behavioral patterns within 130,000+ transactions. Analysts, front-line staff, and managers from the drug services administration use this data to effectively administer services throughout the region. Today, Public Health Wales can leverage data in the field\u2014impacting programs as they happen. Tableau: What types of data do you regularly analyze? Chris Emmerson, Information Analyst Specialist, Public Health Wales: I use quite a lot of data from different sources to look at often alcohol harms and drug harms around Wales to support people in working out how we can meet the needs, reduce the harms, and support the population. So I look at a lot of big data sets, things like hospital admissions, death data, things like that. But the one that I've been most involved in recently is the data from the Harm Reduction Database. The data set that I use most and that I'm lucky enough to talk about here is data from needle and syringe programs all around Wales. Tableau: How does data play a role in your programs? Chris: Well, when people are working in drug services they're working with a client group that's often very difficult, they might not be able to see everything that's happening in their service. They might not be able to understand the patterns of people coming in during the day. So I think what the data really gives us the opportunity to help them to do is to really uncover what's happening across the whole of the service. They upload details of every single transaction that happens. So last year that was more than 130,000 transactions. There were three million needles dispensed. And we also have details on all the people who were using those services. Tableau: Can you give an example of how access to more comprehensive data helps lead to better service? Chris: So the people who are working with that client group, the people who are delivering those services, and to use that data to empower them to make those services even better, to work even more effectively with the people that they're working with, and to help them understand their service and its full size and shape in a way that you can't do without really looking at the data and all the detail. Tableau: What is a recent project that you've been able to accomplish with Tableau? Chris: What we've been able to do recently is start putting all this data together so we can look at the different patterns of when people start, what ages they start, what drugs people are using when they start, and how that's progressing on their career. So you have a new cohort of people starting particular kinds of drugs\u2014to be able to share that between lots of services when you see it happening across an area is very useful, because you have the opportunity for those services to start to take action as something is happening (or hopefully even before). Probably what it's done most is given us the opportunity to bring all of these things out of the data and bring them to the surface so that people can really understand at quite a sophisticated level what kinds of things are going on. It's a great deal of data. It's very high quality data. It's data that people in other parts of the UK aren't as lucky to have. So we feel it's really important that we use it to its greatest ability. We have been getting a little bit better, I think, about using it to support people who are commissioning services, support people who are shaping policy. What's been very valuable about Tableau is the ability to take that data to the people who are actually on the ground."

In Tableau Desktop, users pull data from the institute\u2019s Oracle database to create Tableau workbooks. Teams share workbooks over Tableau Server\u2014allowing them to easily track project progress. And with scheduled updates, researchers know they are using current data. Mark Sanderson, Advanced Research Assistant, explains how tracking samples now takes 30 minutes instead of three and half hours. What started on a few small teams has developed into a company-wide solution. The institute is in the process of creating team scorecards in Tableau so that managers can track team metrics and performance. Tableau: Tell us about the Sanger Institute. Mark Sanderson, Advanced Research Assistant: The Sanger Institute is one of the world leaders in scientific research, specializing in genomes and bio-data. We produce an enormous amount and on a minute-by-minute basis. Tableau has really helped us. Tableau: How does Tableau fit into your workflow? Mark: So across the institute we have a very broad range of science being performed. I work in a team that runs a high throughput pipeline. We produced an enormous amount of data. We never stop, come rain or shine. And we use a specifically built Oracle database. Our database is fantastic for inputting data, for working out where samples are in the pipeline, and it's fantastic for getting reports out. But its visualization capability is quite limited. And although Excel is fantastic at what it does, Tableau can really add value to that by allowing us to visualize our data on almost a minute-by-minute basis, with our live connection from the server to our database. Tableau: Can you share an example of a project where you use Tableau? Mark: So one of my jobs is to track samples through the pipeline, this used to be a sort of three, three-and-a-half hour job once a week. And with Tableau and the visualizations that we've created that's really taken it down to half-an-hour, 45 minutes. So it has saved me a lot of time. Tableau: Are you using Tableau Server? Mark: So the way in which we share the data that we produce is using the Tableau Server. And the Server connects directly to our database. So everything is updated on almost a minute-by-minute basis. And anybody who is interested in any of the data can go straight to the server through their web browser and get straight to what they want to see. Tableau: Are more people adopting Tableau? Mark: Tableau is really gaining traction across the institute. It started off in a couple of very small teams. Ours was one of the early adopters. But it's really working its way up the management hierarchy. We've actually just started implementing a team scorecard, which will cascade up through the management. So any manager can go in and see their specific metrics for their team and that cascades up to the board of management and they can drill down to whatever they want to see. So there have been a few ah-ha moments that have really allowed us to resolve a problem before it becomes a serious issue, which is fantastic and makes us so much more efficient."

Mauno Oksanen, the company\u2019s Business Development Director, summarizes their reporting struggle in one sentence: \u201cOur energy management and other data systems were digital, but our data outputs were analog.\u201d The company relied on manual reporting processes\u2014principally spreadsheets\u2014to turn raw finance, sales, energy output and other data into insight. This approach simply wasn\u2019t scalable enough for the growing business and for future needs. \u201cThe reporting data reached decision makers and the business units too slowly,\u201d said Oksanen. \u201cEnd-of-month reports were often not ready until the second or third week of the following month.\u201d The company was manually blending data from different business units, and each used its own style of reporting. Oksanen continues, \u201cIn each business unit, we had at least a couple staff members working days each month on reports\u2014that\u2019s a significant percentage of our total workforce time.\u201d Since monthly reporting was so resource intensive, we had to prioritize the data that supported the day-to-day running of the business, such as financial close, turnover, and profit forecasts. We knew that there were hidden insights in our data that remained untapped. \u201cBy capturing and analyzing untapped data, we believed the business units would make faster, more informed business decisions\u2014and increase the rate of business growth,\u201d says Oksanen. Since reporting was so resource intensive, the team had to prioritize data that supported day-to-day running of the business, such as financial close, turnover, and profit forecasts. They knew that there were hidden insights in their data that remained untapped. \u201cBy capturing and analyzing untapped data, we believed the business would make faster, more informed energy management decisions\u2014and increase the rate of business growth,\u201d says Oksanen. The Lepp\u00e4koski team first heard about Tableau from Solutive, a local Tableau consulting partner in Finland. Klaus Iltanen, Project Engineer at Lepp\u00e4koski was one of the first to try it. He found that the software was easy to use, but also had the analytical depth they needed to drive insights. \u201cWithin 10 minutes of meeting with Solutive, we were convinced that Tableau was a good tool for the business. We later compared Tableau with other data visualization vendors and Tableau scored high in many categories we set: from the open interfaces and protocols, to the flexible licensing, local support here in Finland and also Gartner rating.\u201d With expert support from Solutive and ongoing knowledge transfer, Lepp\u00e4kosken S\u00e4hk\u00f6 adopted Tableau Desktop and Server within a couple of months. The company now has 12 Tableau Server licenses. \u201cWe simply watched the free Tableau Cloud training videos, listened to Solutive\u2019s professional advice, and we were generating visual, interactive reports. As we move forward, the Tableau community forums also contain lots of helpful tips on using Tableau.\u201d Today, the organization has standardized reporting on Tableau within Lepp\u00e4koski. Using Tableau, the company can easily analyze and combine data from energy production, automated customer meter reading, billing, customer service, and other data systems\u2014all stored in a Microsoft SQL-based data warehouse. And they can bring data from multiple back-end systems into one view to achieve a comprehensive view of the business. The management team and business units use Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server to quickly create a stream of visual, interactive reports and ask new questions, spot trends, identify opportunities, and make decisions. They now have the flexibility to experiment with trend analyses, regressions, and correlations. And employees can view this data on-the-go, with tablets or mobile phones. Those reports have transformed the way Lepp\u00e4koski looks at its data. \u201cIn the past, month-end business reports were often only ready a couple weeks into the following month. Now they are automatically available within days or even hours as soon as source system\u2019s data is ready for reporting. The type of agile, online reporting ensures Lepp\u00e4koski stays competitive in a fast-changing energy market,\u201d says Oksanen. Some of the results Lepp\u00e4koski has experienced from their decision to deploy Tableau include: Solutive continues to play a vital role in Lepp\u00e4koski\u2019s success with Tableau, encouraging business units to create their own self-service reports and get the most out of their data. \u201cSolutive have been like an extension of our own organization,\u201d says Iltanen. \u201cTime and again, their Tableau skills, knowledge and insight have helped Lepp\u00e4koski extend its Tableau footprint and make more sense from more data.\u201d With Tableau, Lepp\u00e4koski has achieved far more than they had originally planned. \u201cTableau has not only automated reporting at Lepp\u00e4koski\u2014it has introduced us to analytics and data mining that we never would have imagined. We can produce an easy-to-understand snapshot of the business that we can share with all the stakeholders. Business reporting is always an ongoing process.\u201d"

Rich Stockley, Chief Research Officer, explains how Tableau has changed the dynamic at Surrey County Council. He regularly meets with senior managers to discuss data, prioritizing fact over intuition. Rich shares how the council uses a Tableau dashboard to track interventions at youth clubs. The dashboard updates every morning, allowing the team to understand priorities and better manage their time. As a result, the team has eliminated unnecessary travel, saving the council money. Processes that used to take weeks now takes mere hours in Tableau. Rich says that this time savings has \u201cfreed up staff to spend time doing more important things.\u201d Tableau: What motivated the council to adopt Tableau? Rich Stockley, Chief Research Officer, Surrey County Council: One of the key problems at the council is that a lot of people that we work with know data quite well, but a lot of the people that we work with don't. So we need to provide them with a tool that they can use that allows them to query a data set. Tableau: Has the council changed how they approach data? Rich: So we're spending time with senior managers, with senior decision makers. We're going into senior management meetings with a data set and with Tableau and sitting down with them and working through the data, answering their questions about the data, dispelling some of the myths that they have about the data, because they always have a perception about the way things are. Tableau: Is it just senior managers who use Tableau? Rich: We really are working right across the organization, right from the bottom up, from front line staff. Tableau: Can you give an example of how you use Tableau? Rich: We have a visualization that tells the team that manages interventions with young people at youth clubs. They get in. It's a live data set. The next morning they can see what happened the night before and they can plan their day ahead, and the manager of that team has said that both he and his staff are driving less miles at work because they know where they need to go when they get into work, and they look at the visualization through Tableau. It also has these unintended benefits as well. It means that we're saving the council money and time by not wasting our time driving around the county. In terms of significant savings in time, I mean it's just immense. So some of the visualizations we're replicating\u2014things that we created previously in other software packages\u2014some of the repetitive processes would take a person all week. And I had one manager who came to me and said that a job that took a week once a month now takes two hours. Tableau: How has that impacted teams? Rich: It's really freed up our staff to spend time doing more important things than looking at Excel and manipulating objects inside Excel. Tableau: How do you keep data secure? Rich: In local government, we have a statutory responsibility to abide by information governance guidelines. So we have a very tight regime around how we store data, how we use data, especially any individual level data we have to be very careful about. In Tableau we have a Tableau Server that runs in our data center and that's completely secure. Tableau: How does the council manage data governance in Tableau Server? Rich: Tableau Server allows staff to have access only to the particular visualizations that they have permission to look at."

        "content": "Edge Digital is a digital marketing start-up consultancy focused on the gaming, technology, and mobile spaces. The company was helping clients solve very specific ad fraud issues\u2014usually analyzing massive volumes of disparate data. With a lean team in a competitive industry, they had to look for a reliable data analysis tool that sped up problem-solving. Leveraging Tableau, Edge Digital can now get accurate insights from their data, very quickly. The team has also adopted Tableau for their day-to-day market research and analysis work. Today Edge Digital provides clients with deep, data-driven insights, faster than ever before. Edge Digital collects up to five gigabytes of data every two weeks in the form of CSV files. The business receives this data from multiple sources, such as Google applications, iOS applications, and 50 advertisement publishers. The challenge? Employees needed to validate the data and effectively blend it for insightful analysis. To respond to clients\u2019 needs, they also needed to be able to quickly understand the data and relay useful information in a timely manner. Edge Digital helps clients solve or avoid ad fraud issues that creep into the relatively new digital-advertising space. In this line of business, the company needs to be able to address serious compliance issues. Edge Digital uses data to quickly resolve issues, helping them stay successful and competitive in the industry. As a start-up with a very lean team, Edge Digital also had to constantly consider resource-allocation time, manpower, and costs to ensure they were staying efficient and productive. The team did not have the luxury of spending weeks looking for a solution to help their clients solve one problem. Additionally, the team also wanted to find a more effective way to present their findings to clients. Lai Tuck Weng, Founder of Edge Digital, used Tableau in previous roles at other companies to solve similar data problems. He remembers finding Tableau the most affordable and efficient tool, perfect for meeting his challenges at his current startup. At Edge Digital, Tuck Weng realized that he needed to find an analytics solution that could help solve the pressing compliance concerns\u2014one that was also scalable for his growing business. \u201cI needed a reliable tool that can quickly and easily help me solve big data challenges for both my company and clients. I was looking for something without complex theories or the need for engineering support,\u201d said Tuck Weng about his reason for deciding on Tableau. As the main person interacting with the company and client data, Tuck Weng could start gathering insights within days of integrating Tableau into existing work processes, with the help of Tableau\u2019s online community and training resources. As a Tableau customer for almost two years now, Edge Digital has since purchased two seats of Tableau Desktop and the team has fully adopted Tableau in day-to-day market research and analysis work. This is only the beginning for Tuck Weng and his team: \u201cThe company is growing and I would like to use Tableau for even deeper analysis, as a supportive tool for faster, better decision making in media neutral programmatic buying for instance.\u201d Since implementing Tableau, Tuck Weng\u2019s team has managed to improve speed to insight, resulting in more meaningful conversations and better relationships with clients. \u201cSpeed to insight has been one of the biggest benefits of using Tableau \u2013 a client request that used to take up more than half a day can now be answered within five minutes,\u201d noted Tuck Weng. \"The speed to insight and data visualizations really give the business a competitive edge. Not all competitors within the ever-changing industry are aware how much of a difference it would make to their business.\u201d Overall, Tableau has enhanced productivity in day-to-day work with colleagues and clients. Although Tuck Weng is leading the use of Tableau within the company, he notes that \u201canyone and everyone can use it, without much technical support.\u201d Tuck Weng also highlighted, \u201cThere is a lot more to be discovered and gained from the use of Tableau. There is no turning back from using Tableau. It is a great product!\u201d"

Today, analysts from the marketing and service planning departments easily create and share workbooks, leading to more efficient, data-driven decisions. Tableau: How does saving time and money help your organization? Amir Hosseini, BI Consultant: As a nonprofit, saving money and time means putting money back to services and to clients, which is the whole goal. Tableau: Why is it important for you to track your non-profit\u2019s program data? Amir: The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) [new initiative that provides support to people with disabilities] has already started in Australia and will roll out completely by year 2019. It changed the whole sector in Australia. There is no more bulk funding from the government, and you have to attend to clients and deliver services. After you\u2019ve delivered a service, then you can claim for that particular service. Because NDIS is coming, we have to change our business model. So to change our business model, we really need to know the status [of our business]. Tableau: What does your data analytics process look like? Amir: We get data from different sources\u2014six internal sources and some external sources. We put it into a dimensional structure, and then that data goes to Tableau. We have two databases or data stages, and both are hosted on Amazon Web Services. One is just a relational data source, which is like a repository of our sources just going to a single data source. Then, from there, we create the dimensional model on Amazon RDS. And then it goes to Tableau data extracts and to Tableau reports. So that design part and the whole journey for us was lots of redesigning and changing. So we were far ahead from our deadlines. It was much faster for the business to see the report."

The team shares reports with other departments using Tableau Cloud. In video 1, Brian Bunce, Senior Director of Research & Analysis, explains how with Tableau Cloud, he doesn\u2019t have to maintain servers or hire a data administrator\u2014freeing up time to resolve student challenges. In video 2, Brian shares how reports that used to take weeks now take just a couple of days. With faster access to data, the university favors data-driven decisions over intuition. BU\u2019s Tableau deployment continues to grow as more departments find value in their data. For example, the marketing department now spots trends in web traffic that they couldn't see with Google Analytics alone. Tableau: What was most important to you in choosing a Business Intelligence (BI) solution? Brian Bunce, Senior Director, Research & Analysis: What we considered when looking for a BI tool was something that was very easy to use, easy to understand, easy to set up, and something that our end users could comprehend without having to go through multiple training sessions on it. Something that we could say: \u201cIt's turnkey. Guys, here it is, have fun with it. We can help, but guess what? It's intuitive enough that you can roll with it yourselves.\u201d So the difference for us between [Tableau] Online and the on-premise Tableau [Server] literally was back to that turnkey analogy I talked about earlier, which was the fact that we could automatically just turn it on. We had it. It was good to go. We didn't have anybody that had to learn how to be a data administrator. Tableau: Can you please tell us about your current data environment? Brian: Our data sits in multiple different systems. We do use a transactional system, which houses all of the classes they've [students] registered for, all of their official grades. We can get their persistence and graduation information out of there. But then if we want to look at what the students\u2019 thoughts are, responding to us through surveys or questions we've asked, that's in an entirely different system. And so we have to attach to that system along with our transactional system, along with our customer relationship management system (CRM). And then we have the Google Analytics that we have to pull in for website information on who's visiting, where they are going, what we are doing right, what we are needing to improve on. And that leads us into certain aspects of what else can we do. Tableau: What key data insights does Tableau help you find? Brian: We can look at the data and help predict where those pain points are for the students so that we can reach out to them before they get there. So that predictive piece is really what's sitting in the data that we try to extract to make sure that we can help out as best as possible. Tableau: How do you feel about the way you\u2019re able to analyze your data in Tableau? Brian: It's super exciting what we're able to do. It's something that when we see the spark, we see them light up, we know, \u2018hey, this isn't just a fun tool out there, this is literally answering questions that not only we had, but it's answering questions we didn't know we had, too.\u2019 Tableau: Who are your biggest end-users of Tableau and why is Tableau important to them? Brian: Our biggest end users right now are actually the executive team. The executives take our information we provide to them, and they roll it down layer by layer. Because, ultimately, our goal is to be there to assist students so that they can succeed. We want them to walk out with the skill sets necessary to be successful in their careers. And so what we do is we focus everything on how can we help these students be successful. And so it's, first, understanding where we may find pain points. And we roll those out and we show the executives where we could change a few processes, or we could update processes, or we could keep processes that are working and say, \u201cThis is what we need in order to help our students.\u201d Tableau: What about Tableau excites your executives? Brian: What really excites our executives is when they look at what capabilities this system [Tableau] has, they start to say, \"Wait a minute, how long is it going to take you to build that?\" And we can say, \"A couple of days.\" No longer does it take weeks. So when the executives really start digging in, looking at the data, they would ask for more and more things from us. And that, in the past, with the other tools we used to use, used to take weeks. We would respond to them in weeks with what we had. Now we've cut that down to days with Tableau Software. Tableau: What wider changes has Tableau helped spark at your university? Brian: In the past, a lot of corporations, including our own, used intuition to say this is what we should do\u2014used past experiences\u2014and there's nothing wrong with that. But when we have data at our fingertips that can lead us into a direction and say, \u201cThese are data-driven decisions, this is fact, there's no intuition about it. This is fact, this is the trend, this is what's going to happen.\u201d That has helped us tremendously to make decisions. We have moved from intuition-based to data-driven-based."

In education, data is crucial to gauging student success and keeping standards high. Chief Information Officer, Raju Varanasi, shares how Tableau allows principals all over Australia to dive into their data. With Tableau Desktop, they can benchmark comprehension against nearby schools and track student progress. Also, principals have permissions to add local data sets to Tableau Server, enriching insights and establishing a single source of truth. Tableau: What is the value of data in the education sector? Raju Varanasi, Chief Information Officer: We exist for students' learning. And we want to see that whatever we invest both time, effort, resources, facilities, give utmost value to the students' learning. Data in education, as in many other industries and sectors, is very valuable to inform the efficacy, the effectiveness, and the overall improvement that can happen. And it can also give opportunity to correct or intervene, as we say in education, in time so that the students get the best and achieve their utmost potential. Tableau: What were some of the challenges before Tableau? Raju: In the past, probably because of the lack of tools or lack of other opportunities, we could not triangulate the true value of data Tableau: How has that changed now that CEDP has Tableau? Raju: There is now more opportunity, thanks to Tableau and the likes of Tableau analytics have done magic for us. And although we're in the first part of the journey, we can already see tremendous value. Tableau: What kind of data do you analyze in Tableau? Raju: Obviously, in the course of teaching, learning, schooling, we generate a lot of data. And the data could be socioeconomic, demographic, performance of course, and then resources and operations and so on and so forth. For example, we know the geography demography of our students and then we know their performance and the socioeconomic status and their extracurricular activities. Tableau: How has Tableau changed the way that you analyze that data? Raju: So what's exciting is that we are able to turn around that very data that is collected through our systems, but has been a sleeper in the process or at least very hard or clumsy to modify and curate and compile. Now, we're able to provide in a more valuable form. And that's why they're excited. Tableau: What are some of your goals as Chief Information Officer? Raju: As CIO, I would like to make sure that data actually sees the light of day and that it actually improves or contributes to improvement of learning. Because if used proactively, it can improve the student's learning\u2014because no one gets time back, especially those formative years. When a kid is, say, six months behind in reading or 12 months behind in mathematics or numeracy, we are talking about valuable time. Principals in Australia, Principals and teachers have the most significant in students' learning. They're asking questions about students, teachers, resources, dollars, progress. So all this comes from various angles, but we develop this excellence framework to encapsulate most of the questions the schools would ask. Tableau: What are some questions that principals ask of the data? Raju: Which students are behind? How is my school doing compared to other schools? Am I above the state benchmarks or international benchmarks? How are my students growing in terms of their reading, writing, spelling, and comprehension. Tableau: How do you manage permissions in Tableau Server? How do you serve data to principals? Raju: And then we allow the principals to be publishers with certain rights so that they can add local data sets. And instead of giving them a blank canvas, we are giving them a half-filled or 70-, 80-percent-filled canvas so that they can use the initial momentum that we're giving to add. And then they will enrich the insights and the actions. Tableau: What advice would you give other CIO\u2019s in the education sector? Raju: What I would advise to other CIOs in comparable situations in education is to open up, extract value, share, build the opportunity for those service delivery process in schools, classrooms, for them to dissect the data and use it for teacher and students' learning."

        "company": "Canterbury District Health Board (DHB)",
        "content": "The Canterbury District Health Board (DHB) is the main planner and funder of health services in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. One of Canterbury DHB\u2019s key strategies is to leverage data to drive an integrated health system. The DHB needed to strengthen its data analytics and visualization capabilities. With almost 20 years\u2019 worth of data stored in a data warehouse, static reports along with ad-hoc querying made it difficult for the business to see and understand their data. The Decision Support team sought a solution that would let a wide group of staff easily interact with data, while empowering the wider workforce to make more data-driven decisions. In three years, Canterbury DHB has transformed the way that employees view and interact with data, including employees from other District Health Boards within New Zealand. Enabling health professionals to benefit from self-service data analytics was a driving factor in adopting Tableau as its preferred visual analytics software. Tableau is now one of the key tools empowering the Canterbury DHB to drive important decisions concerning the health and wellbeing of New Zealanders. Canterbury DHB holds nearly 20 years of patient activity data in a data warehouse, each associated with its own set of metrics. Canterbury DHB is responsible for planning, funding, and provisioning healthcare services to a population of over 540,000 residents. Over the course of a year, this includes almost 120,000 hospital admissions, over one million outpatient appointments, and approximately 100,000 emergency department attendances. In addition, Canterbury DHB also collects data from pharmacy and radiology services, operating theatres, and laboratory tests. Over almost 20 years, that amounts to almost 500 million events, managed by the Decision Support team. The health board also collects data from other South Island DHBs. All of this data is stored in an enterprise data warehouse. With this data, the team responds to information requests from across the organization and generates reports. As requests for data grew, the team realized that fixed reports were no longer serving the needs of the health board. John Wilkinson, Decision Support Manager at Canterbury DHB explains, \u201cThe data we are managing gets very big when you think about every procedure, every drug issued to a patient, every diagnostic test, every inpatient and outpatient event, and much more. It was all being accessed in an inefficient manner. We\u2019d been providing fixed-format reports for many, many years,\u201d he says. If the requestor had follow-up questions, or wanted to view the data in a different way, the Decision Support team would have to rerun the report\u2014causing delays. \u201cWe constantly had to re-run those reports with different selections in order to get a slightly different view of the data.\u201d And the Decision Support team had no way to track how many people were accessing each report. Canterbury DHB wanted to encourage informed decision making across the business. Part of this goal was enabling employees to readily interact with data in a self-service, interactive format. \u201cThe ability to consolidate and filter the data required for each stakeholder was a main focus for us,\u201d said John. The decision to purchase an analytics solution went beyond time savings. Leadership wanted to create a more data-driven culture throughout the organization. \u201cWe were interested in finding a solution which would ensure a good uptake of self-service analytics and reinforce distributed, informed decision-making across the workforce,\u201d said John. A team member had heard about Tableau from respected people in the industry. He decided to download the 30-day Tableau Desktop trial at home and had positive results. \u201cAfter hearing about the trial and what my staff member was able to achieve using small sets of data, I was intrigued and started wondering if this was something that would work on an organizational scale,\u201d he says. Following a quick office demo using a sample data set, John was impressed. He purchased two Tableau Desktop licenses and the team began working with data in new and interesting ways. He challenged his team to use Tableau and see what they could produce; the engagement levels of his staff rapidly increased, prompting John to purchase another two licenses for his team. Over the course of time, John has provided all of the Decision Support team with Tableau Desktop, along with other like-minded, analytical staff members in other departments. Montage\u2014a Tableau partner since 2008\u2014supported Canterbury DHB at the beginning of their Tableau deployment. Montage conducted initial mentoring sessions to better understand their processes. They also utilized Tableau workbooks that had been successful for other DHBs. After using Tableau Desktop for a few months, Canterbury DHB started to share visualizations across the business using Tableau packaged workbooks. However, the team wanted to encourage collaboration and promote a single source of truth. They quickly realized they would need a better strategy for sharing interactive dashboards. \u201cConstantly pulling data and updating the workbooks was going to be an expensive and time-consuming activity so we decided to have a look at Tableau Server, which enabled us to automate a lot of the work we had been doing,\u201d John said. The team\u2019s ability to analyze and share data has delivered far-reaching benefits. John and his team can now effortlessly provide automated dashboards through Tableau Server, embedded in a SharePoint portal. As a result, staff access business intelligence data from a single source of truth to inform their decision making. One of the principles of the Decision Support team is to enable staff to \u201cmanage by fact, not anecdote.\u201d With Tableau Server, John\u2019s team can easily refresh the data in a visualization, instead of manually updating reports when the data changes. And employees can access views through a web browser, leading to faster turnaround times. John said, \u201cThe fact we can automate through Tableau Server means that we can turn data around quickly on a regular basis \u2013 some as frequently as every 15 minutes.\u201d And in Tableau Server, the team can track the popularity of each view, revealing the data that is most relevant to business users. In addition to satisfying the information needs of Canterbury DHB, the Decision Support team is beginning to manage data on behalf of its sister DHB on the West Coast of the South Island. Canterbury manages the data, ensuring data quality. The team then creates dashboards\u2014shared through Tableau Reader\u2014to South Island district health boards at no extra effort. \u201cA real benefit we\u2019ve identified is that we can manage the data sets for multiple organisations through one application\u2026This type of functionality lets us take a lead role in assisting other South Island DHBs.\u201d Within three years of adopting Tableau as a primary analytics tool, Canterbury DHB has seen more people using Tableau, along with an increasing demand for data. Today, Canterbury DHB manages a portfolio of 45 Tableau workbooks, with approximately 100 individual views\u2014and growing. Today, the Canterbury DHB uses Tableau to explore specific cohorts of patient activity, providing rapid insights into previously under-utilised data. Through automation and self-service, Canterbury DHB has been able to foster a data-driven, informed approach in developing plans and processes. John and his team work with data to help influence decisions on a daily basis. The team can now visualize patient-experience data to identify outliers\u2014and predict areas where they could better service customer health needs. As more employees engage with Tableau, Canterbury DHB has been able to grow its Division Support team with more qualified, engaged employees. John says, \u201cMore satisfied, highly engaged employees means we\u2019re able to attract a high caliber of applicant. This means the work my department is responsible for producing is of higher quality, so we get more visibility throughout the organization and it\u2019s easier for me to manage as a result.\u201d With Tableau Desktop, Server, and Reader, the Decision Support team saves time in their reporting cycle\u2014while serving the needs of the business. As more people adopt the software, the organization continues to move towards a more data-driven approach to healthcare."

In this video, Susan shares a view of \u201cROI\u201d that goes way beyond the traditional calculation. According to Susan, the speed and flexibility she has gained with Tableau allows her to be the business owner\u2014and the parent \u2014that she wants to be. Susan Baier, Founder & Owner, Audience Audit: I don\u2019t want to be extreme, but Tableau literally makes the business I run and the life I lead possible. I have a daughter who\u2019s 13 and we were talking about a hairstyle that she wanted to do for a dance and she said, \u201cMom, sometimes it\u2019s hard that the other girls have mommies that do hair.\u201d She goes, \u201cOn the other hand, none of the other mommies run their own corporations.\u201d And I laughed because my kids have a model for a life that is fulfilled. I\u2019ve been so lucky to be at this point in my life and be doing exactly what I want to do, exactly the way I want to do it, and I want that for other people. Susan: I\u2019m really passionate about the little guy. A lot of my clients are small businesses and for them, that\u2019s their mortgage, that\u2019s their kid\u2019s education\u2014it\u2019s really, really important. Tableau gave me the ability to serve the people I\u2019m trying to serve. I love making my clients happy and it\u2019s really hard sometimes without flexibility. In the old days before Tableau, I would\u2019ve had to make a choice between my family and my clients. To not have to choose between my work, my clients, and my family is huge. I cherish Tableau for that. It sounds silly. I know it does. I get emotional about it. I credit Tableau with making it possible."

CRIF High Mark packages product data, geographical data, and demographic data as part of a subscription offering to clients. They deliver this data through dashboards shared on Tableau Server. Clients can analyze their own portfolios alongside information from the credit bureau data pool\u2014allowing them to better understand their data and uncover business opportunities. In video 2, Rakesh Rallapalli, Practice Lead on the Business Analytics team, describes their success with Tableau\u2019s mapping capabilities. Even with millions of address records, Rakesh\u2019s team can create maps with just a few clicks in Tableau Desktop. In addition to traditional mapping, the team can also create complex heat maps in less than a day\u2014a process that used to take up to a week. Tableau: Why were you looking for a business intelligence tool? Rakesh Rallapalli, Practice Lead, Business Analytics: Data has become a commodity. We were looking out for ways where we could provide users with more intelligence on demand. Tableau: What kinds of data do you work with on a daily basis? Rakesh: We're talking about geographies. We're talking about product lines. We're talking about customer demographics. We're talking about publicly available data to enable non-traditional use cases of the credit bureau industry, such as the insurance sector and the telecom sector. Tableau: How do you deliver data to clients? Rakesh: We have packaged all of this onto one single platform, a pre-designed report, be it on-demand data from the bureau or interactive data discovery on dashboards; all of these we have been able to package onto a platform. Tableau: How has Tableau benefitted your clients? Rakesh: We enable our clients to not only analyze their own portfolios, or their own data and information from the credit bureau data pool, but also perform benchmarking analysis, perform portfolio performance and quality kinds of reports. We offer this on a subscription based model to our clientele, and they can subscribe and utilize these services. And that is where the self-service kicks in. Tableau: What kinds of insights do your users extract from the data? Rakesh: Now if you had to provide all of this information at this grain, you are putting the ability into the hands of the end user to figure out the lending hotspots in the market, risk of concentration, whether their business is spread across a region correctly, whether they have their branch network cover all of this population. So these are the kind of insights that the users have been able to extract out of our systems. Tableau: How have clients reacted to Tableau? Rakesh: They even get surprised, and they sense, \"Oh, really, I can do that? I can figure out my own geography and filter and get the data out of the system, look at it on a heat map? Wow, that's brilliant.\" Tableau: How does your company use Tableau? Rakesh: We have been working with Tableau as one of the preferred platforms of choice for doing a lot of analytics, both in the form of geographical analysis as well as putting the power into the hands of the end users in the form of a self-service business discovery mode. Tableau: What challenges were you facing? Rakesh: In India we were facing a unique challenge in terms of the volume of the data that we are processing. So just to give you a perspective, we're talking about an address library of about 500 million records across India. Now a very important part of all of this is to be able to map the data onto geographies, demarcate them well, and map the data comprehensively. So we have been able to design dashboards that provide users information with over 40 million rows worth of aggregated data. Now put this into the context of geography and we are talking about 36 Indian states, more than 650 districts in India. Tableau: Were you considering any other business intelligence solutions? Why did you choose Tableau? Rakesh: Since Tableau has the integration abilities with the open source web mapping software as well, that's one of the strengths of Tableau that we are leveraging. We were looking at the likes of QlikView from Qlik. We were also looking at MicroStrategy, and geo-analytics is one of CRIF High Mark's strengths in India. The entire seamless integration that Tableau offers in terms of geo-mapping capabilities is something that enticed us towards leveraging Tableau. Tableau: Are there any other Tableau features that are important to your company? Rakesh: Now we have been able to design this entire solution in a plug-and-play manner. Tomorrow it could be out of the Indian geography and in the geography of Hong Kong and the solution would still function well. Tableau: Can you share an example of how Tableau has saved you time? Rakesh: Though it's a little context based, just to give you a small example; a heat map, which would otherwise take 40 man hours before Tableau, right now, takes us less than a day. That's a reduction of almost 80 percent. Thanks to Tableau, we are looking at going to the next level in terms of geo-analytics as well as information intelligence in India."

        "company": "De Montfort University",
        "content": "De Montfort University, formed in 1870 and originally called the Leicester School of Art, has quickly gone from offering voluntary education to being accredited with \u2018world-leading\u2019 and \u2018internationally excellent\u2019 status for its research efforts. The university has 127 different nationalities enrolled on its 170 undergraduate and postgraduate courses. With a vision to \u2018be a recognised leader in creative education and research,' De Montfort encourages pioneering thinking by both staff and students. De Montfort\u2019s Strategic Planning department analyzes data ranging from marketing campaigns to admission statistics. After purchasing Tableau for reporting, the software quickly spread across the entire university. Today, several teams use Tableau Desktop and Server, including the finance, academic quality, and human resources departments. With Tableau, staff are engaging with data on a deeper level\u2014spending less time deciphering the data and more time finding hidden insights. The Strategic Planning Service\u2014responsible for turning business data into strategic information\u2014is a key contributor to the university's vision. The team focuses on delivering reports that assist in decision making. \u201cWe have a clear remit to provide information in the best way to the different faculties and business partners that we work with,\u201d explains David Bryan, Head of Academic Planning at the university. \u201cThe information we collate needs to be two things; data rich and easy to understand,\" explains David. \u201cIt should clearly answer the question, what does this tell us?\u201d The department analyzes student data in a number of ways, using a variety of tools, putting together reports that would help their colleagues with marketing campaigns and admission statistics. However, it became apparent that there was a clear need to start communicating data in a more sophisticated way. David explains, \u201cPresenting data meaningfully was difficult to achieve as the solutions we had in place were very technical. People found them difficult to use.\" This situation also created additional problems for David and the planning team. \u201cBecause the tools were so complex to master, updating reports took considerable time and effort,\" said David. \"Their lack of flexibility meant that users often couldn't generate the answers that stakeholders were looking for.\u201d As a result of the problems with existing tools, departments begin to look elsewhere for solutions. \u201cOther teams were doing their own thing. It was often easier for them to produce ad-hoc data solutions of their own, rather than rely on our central reporting function. In turn, our own staff started to become disengaged,\u201d explains David. With departments and colleagues using different tools, collaboration was becoming impossible. \u201cIn meetings, teams would bring along their own data and it would be different to everyone else,\u201d recalls David. \u201cInstead of data that could be quickly assessed and understood, everyone would have slightly differing views.\" As a result, time was being wasted, meetings weren't productive, and reporting output was poor. David knew action needed to be taken. \u201cOur staff weren't happy, and consumers of our reports where becoming more and more disengaged. A review was required.\u201d The department needed a solution. Their current tool was stifling productivity and preventing progress. To improve engagement with colleagues and other teams, they needed to make some changes. David was heavily involved: \u201cThere was already a project in place to look at business intelligence tools for the next five years. The project quickly highlighted the need for immediate action. It was clear that we needed to get moving sooner rather than later, so we decided to trial a number of visualisation solutions.\" The team conducted extensive research and assessed a number of bespoke solutions. These included Qlikview, Tableau, and Birst. \u201cWe wanted to be thorough with our research and choose a tool that was right for us.\" Over the coming months, David and the planning team tried out five different visualisation tools with various members of the department. David recalls his first experience with Tableau: \u201cAs soon as I used [Tableau], I knew it would immediately add value to what we did, but I also knew this was a tool everyone could easily use. This was key to our decision.\u201d The department trialed Tableau over an initial two week period. A number of dashboards were built for the team, to see what Tableau could offer. The dashboards used real data and were based on real reports\u2014KPIs and university league tables. The trial was a huge success and the feedback from within the team was conclusive. \u201cIn terms of our requirements it did everything we wanted,\u201d said David. The initial trial hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed with other departments. HR and Finance showed an interest in Tableau. David explains, \u201cWe had to ask for an extension for the trial, such was demand.\u201d Tableau agreed and more people got involved. Due to the success of the trial, the Strategic Planning Service selected Tableau as their tool of choice and began using it in earnest. The interest from other departments meant that authorisation was granted by the university to buy 40 Tableau Server licenses and 10 Tableau Desktop licenses. Interest was prevalent across the board. Faculty managers, HR and finance data analysts, deans, and core executive stakeholders all became involved in the trial process. David believes a big factor in why Tableau has been so successful is down to its ease of use. David commented, \u201cOur previous tool was very technical, which put new users off.\" Tableau eradicated this problem. \u201cStaff of all levels and abilities use Tableau, as it\u2019s extremely intuitive. We can develop polished, good-looking solutions in a short amount of time and not have to worry about end-user training.\" With a wide variety of staff now using Tableau for report creation, viewing data, and sharing with their colleagues, it wasn\u2019t long before the wider university community showed an interest. Within three months, such was demand, a decision needed to be made. David explains, \u201cThe widespread uptake across the university meant every business area was now wanting to use Tableau to produce reports.\" With the popularity of Tableau, it was decided that an institutional licence was the only way to go. De Montfort University subsequently bought an institutional licence, so that Tableau could be made available to all of its staff. Having been involved right from the beginning, David knew the power of Tableau. He didn\u2019t, however, anticipate the sheer uptake from other members of the university staff. \u201cWhen we started this process, I couldn\u2019t have imagined that we\u2019d be in the position we are today.\" David continues, \u201cTo have an institutional license so quickly is fantastic. What is even more rewarding is seeing the output and enthusiasm from users across the university. It is clear Tableau has been an unmitigated success at De Montfort.\u201d Tableau has benefited the Strategic Planning Service, but the software has also benefited other teams at the university. The Academic Quality Department uses Tableau to deliver information to colleagues, while the HR department uses Tableau to provide data for specific projects like Athena Swan, which recognises commitment to advancing women\u2019s careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. A number of benefits have stood out in particular:"

The Data Team at BlaBlaCar wanted to give employees across the company access to real self-service business intelligence. To make this goal a reality, they chose the combination of Dataiku\u2019s Data Science Studio for data prep in combination with Tableau for visual data analysis. They share completed visualizations through Tableau Server. With help from Tableau and DSS, BlaBlaCar can quickly track how members are responding to new features or support R&D efforts like Machine Learning. Tableau: Who uses the combination of Tableau and Data Science Studio (DSS) at BlaBlaCar? Ga\u00eblle Periat, BI Manager, BlaBlaCar: At BlaBlaCar, everyone uses Tableau or DSS. They have so many different uses: from approving a new feature, which means we're going to pull data from the application, to getting a visualization of: 'Does it work? Are people happy, etc.' And they can also result in analyses with a huge impact on marketing or completely, more on R&D, which means we're going to try to do some testing in an even deeper, more probing way, going as far as machine learning, etc.\" Thomas Cabrol, Chief Data Scientist, Daitaku: In terms of business use cases, there are all kinds of uses that are relevant for Blablacar with the combination of Data Science Studio + Tableau. The idea is that users can really manipulate and model their data in Data Science Studio, then visualize it, interact, and really analyze the data in Tableau. Tableau: Why did your company decide to invest in a combination of Tableau with DSS? Ga\u00eblle: The benefits that we can get thanks to the combination of DSS and Tableau will be pretty numerous and varied. We will be able to use it to improve the product. We can to use it to improve our user experience, because for us, our members are truly fundamental, and they\u2019re going to be the main focus of our work, so we strive to help them to be more comfortable with our product. We will also be able to address some more marketing and business-focused points and benefits, as well as those more geared towards forecasting, etc.\u2014which go somewhat hand in hand with the world of data and the way we organize ourselves these days. So there will be also a lot of future usages of the combo DSS and Tableau together that are coming up and will help us at BlaBlaCar. Tableau: What are some of the current use cases of Tableau and DDS solution? Ga\u00eblle: There is all this phase of what these days is called Machine Learning, which is going to be more about forecasting and recommendations. And then, as I just said a few minutes ago, thanks to the DSS plugin with Tableau, we will be able to offer self-service BI. In other words, we will be able to provide users with data. Then it is up to them to prepare the data and then integrate them into Tableau to tell their stories and carry out their own analyses. Tableau: Why did you choose the combination of DSS and Tableau for your business intelligence solution? Ga\u00eblle: So the idea is really to prepare the data via DSS and to use Tableau for visualization, so that we can tell stories or carry out deeper analyses which will help us manage our product and make decisions more easily. Thomas: The two solutions' technologies complement each other directly. As Ga\u00eblle said, DSS's interactive 'data preparation' component is a real strength and in the end, it enables Tableau users, and a great many of them too, to consume data that have been cleaned up and enriched beforehand, and that are easier to use with Tableau so that everyone can derive maximum value from them."

        "content": "Premier has \u201ca mission to transform healthcare.\u201d To support this mission, the company embeds Tableau Server into their PremierConnect Enterprise solution, helping healthcare organizations get seamless access to data. Premier gathers data from insurance companies, electronic health record systems (EHR), and more. In Tableau, they can present their customers with a single source of truth from multiple data sources. Premier's customers access dashboards over Tableau Server, where they can see an overview of business processes, and easily drill down into a specific challenge or concern. With self-service analytics, Premier enables business intelligence, while giving customers control over their own data. Tableau: How do your customers react to using Tableau in PremierConnect Enterprise? Rush Shah, Product Manager, Analytics Factory: I think one of the big things PremierConnect Enterprise customers really like about Tableau is the ability to now do three or four different kinds of analytics. So they're really investigating their own healthcare markets of their region. And having geospatial capabilities or visualizations has been a boon to them. We use Tableau in an OEM capacity, and our customers are fully aware. We've always thought of rebranding Tableau, but we don't see any need for rebranding it. We feel like the product speaks for itself, and we are leveraging the product. Tableau: What inspired you to create PremierConnect Enterprise? Rush: So we are creating their data warehouse on our managed data platform, with really large health organizations. Data management and data warehousing is where the big lift is, it's where the hard stuff is. Especially in healthcare where there are so many clinical terminologies, where there is master data issues, you're getting data from insurance company in a certain way, you're getting data from your EHR, electronic health record system in a certain way, you have a different decision support system\u2014and all of them are manifesting data in a different way. So you have to bring all of it together, create master data for your patients, for your care providers. So we believe that we can help healthcare organizations do that better. And then we can give them tools like Tableau to basically create analytics themselves. Tableau: What is the impact? Rush: You can look at them and you can just describe the facts, or you could look at them and create a ways to see where you can improve your performance, where you can improve the performance of the doctors, where you can give tools to your care providers to understand what's happening at an aggregated summary high level, and then allow them to drill down, laser focus on the problem itself. What we have done is really narrowed down the distance between the analyst or between the nurse or the care provider or the care manager and the data. That distance is now rapidly disappearing. And that I think is the right momentum. Tableau: How would you describe the benefits of self service? Rush: We believe that that analytics can be done very well at the department level, by the analyst, by people who are close to that data, by people who are close to that business problem. And where we like tools like Tableau is that it is an extremely user-friendly, intuitive tool that can be used for analytics. Tableau: Has Tableau changed the way that your customers interact with data? Rush: I would say one of the things that our customers or PremierConnect Enterprise customers have gained a lot is adapting themselves to a visual way of thinking. The BI communities are reshaping themselves or they are adapting to this changing environments, and they are trying to become more focused on the analytical problem with respect to the business's problems. It's where you want to take your business and how you're going to achieve that is the difficult part. And so a lot of our customers now have the right tools in place, the right data platform in PremierConnect Enterprise, the right Tableau tool to help them really march forward towards those goals. And they are incredibly well aligned now to do that. Fast to Create. Fast to Market. Learn more about Tableau Embedded Analytics."

        "content": "InTouch Data provides SaaS and tactical solutions for hotel brands such as Accor Hotels, IHG, Peninsula, Punthill, Shangri-La, to name a few. Hotels collect massive amounts of transaction data ranging from price per room, room type, hotel segments, memberships, hotel purchases, and more. InTouch Data sources this data from clients\u2019 property management systems and brings it into Tableau. With Tableau, InTouch Data helps hotel clients move from spreadsheets to strategic, interactive dashboards\u2014shared over Tableau Server. CEO Peter Johnson comments, \u201cThe things that you can do with data and Tableau are things that we'd never dreamed that we could do with data before.\u201d Tableau: How much data does your industry gather? Peter Johnson, CEO: Hotels have massive amounts of data. It's probably one industry that has more data about an individual client transaction than almost all other industries. Tableau: Has Tableau made a difference to people who work with the data? Peter: Tableau has made us go wow, there's something we can really do with the data to make it look good as well as being meaningful. The things that you can do with data and Tableau are things that we'd never dreamed that we could do with data before. Tableau: What happens to the data you get from hotels? Peter: We take data from hotels, we re-engineer that data, and then we push it into other vendors' applications that are then using it back with their hotel clients. Tableau: How do you use Tableau to improve on old industry processes? Peter: The industry has become very dependent on Excel spreadsheets. And that's one of the first things that we say to our clients when we walk through the door: Show us your spreadsheets. And we'll convert them into more usable, meaningful type data. Tableau: How easy is it for your customers to enjoy the benefits of Tableau? Peter: We give them the ability to basically flick a switch and they can see exactly what they want, how they want. And the beauty of Tableau is that anybody can have the same data in a different shape or format depending on their needs. Tableau: Does Tableau foster a more creative environment at InTouch Data? Peter: With Tableau, I fell in love with data all over again. I just think it's a very powerful tool. I wonder where I'd be in the industry if something like that had come past my desk 20 years ago when I was slaving over a stove full of hot data and wondering what was going to come out at the end of the day. Tableau: Do you think that Tableau is making an impact on the hotel industry? Peter: I think Tableau is one of those pieces of software or pieces of technology that comes along and really has transformational effects on certain industries and businesses. And I believe that Tableau is going to revolutionize data for hotels. Tableau: Why did you choose Tableau? Peter: I think the reason that we sort of wandered, for want of a better word, into Tableau is because it's exactly what we were looking for. Data, historically, in hotels has been driven by accountants and financial controllers. [It has historically been]very boring, Excel-based spreadsheets. Tableau: Where is this transaction data stored? Peter: Essentially, the client data that we take is basically anything that's held in a property management system from a hotel's guest perspective; it's everything from their personal details right through to each and every transaction they have during the stay\u2014how much they paid for their room, what sort of room type, how they've been segmented within the hotel, whether they're a hotel member, whether they've got an e-mail address, what they had from the mini bar, how much they spent on laundry. Tableau: How do you bring that data into Tableau? Peter: A hotel's software is called a property management system. So every hotel runs a property management system of some sort. What we do is we have an extraction agent which we call PMS Extract. And that enables us to pull data from different property management systems. Tableau: How does Tableau help you analyze all of that data? Peter: Tableau allows you to slice and dice the data into such tiny segments that if hotels are smart enough, they can use those individual segments to provide individual information or communicate to individual groups of guests."

Shortly after purchasing Tableau, adoption quickly grew across the company. Today, Marico employees discuss data on a daily basis\u2014something that Girish says \u201cwas not heard of three years back.\u201d Business users have moved from static Excel reports towards an automated, visual approach to data. Using Tableau\u2019s data connectors, the team can easily connect to data sources like SAP Business Warehouse (SAP BW) and Microsoft SQL Server. And with Tableau Server, the company ensures that the data is accurate and secure. Tableau: Can you speak about your experience with Tableau? Girish Rao, Head of IT & Business Analytics: If you use Tableau, Tableau gives you nirvana as far as data visualization is concerned. Actually, you don't have to bother about how data will get visualized, or how data will be seen. You don't have to worry about comprehending data. You just have to bother and worry about how to get the data right, get it accurate, and get it in one place\u2014even if it is in different data sources. But the fact of the matter is that you don't have to worry about visualization and comprehending. You just have to worry about getting the data there. Tableau: What was your first experience with Tableau? How has that changed over time? Girish: Three years back, when we were evaluating Tableau and we came across this tool when I ended up asking, \u201cOkay, the question is, can I bet my career on this particular product?\u201d So coming from a perspective where there was nothing\u2014people had not heard about Tableau\u2014from that stage, to a place where there are a lot of adopters. It\u2019s good that I placed my bet on Tableau. I think it has yielded good results. I mean, we've gone a lot of distance. And what started as a small analytics day at Marico just to give a brief to our guys as to what analytics is all about, has actually flowered and transformed into a big journey. And having done that, I think over the years I've realized that Tableau has lived up to the expectations. And actually, I feel fulfilled of having made the right decision. Tableau: In your opinion, what is special about Tableau? Girish: So I think it was just an awesome feeling that we could just get it up and running and create prototypes within a few hours. That was a real good experience. And that experience has lived up to its expectation over the last three years. We came across Tableau by accident. We just downloaded a trial version on a Thursday, and the whole thing was up and running, and we were able to create prototypes by Monday. Tableau: How has your approach to data changed over the past three years? Girish: I think today people talk about analytics, people talk about visualization, people talk about automated reports, people talk about consuming data. This was not heard of three years back. As far as the business users are concerned, people want to just to do away with crunching information on Excel and move towards an automated, visualized data so that they can concentrate more on taking decisions rather than spending time on churning data. What we could develop in three to four days, now we're able to do it in a few hours. Tableau: What has been the impact on Marico? Girish: So if you go to each and every department [at Marico], people would say that time spent on crunching data and time spent on really consuming the information has come down. And they're able to concentrate more on analysis of information, more in terms of analyzing that information, more in terms of giving decisions to the business users. Tableau: What data sources do you analyze in Tableau? Girish: We have SAP as the biggest source. We have SAP BW as the next biggest source. We have lots of portals that generate information, which is there in SQL Server. So consuming data from different sources was traditionally the biggest challenge. How do we homogenize it, how do we harmonize it? Tableau: Can you share more about that challenge, and how Tableau helped you solve it? Girish: So with all this big data, there's a big data challenge. We have a data store where this comes in. And then we use Tableau to visualize it. So as far as big data is concerned, what happened is they were in different data sources. We were able to harmonize it and homogenize it in one place so that Tableau can consume it. Tableau: Has Tableau had a personal impact on you? Girish: It gives me great pride to say that Tableau actually helped me in taking the next leap in terms of using this information and converting this information for decision making."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "When Wine purchased Tableau licenses in 2012, they simultaneously created their business intelligence (BI) sector, with a goal to democratize data. With Tableau, business sectors produce their own sales reports, allowing the IT team to focus on other important projects. And with Tableau Cloud, employees can access prebuilt dashboards to answer strategic questions. The BI team publishes data sources to Tableau Cloud, ensuring a single source of truth. Today, seven business sectors use Tableau\u2014and the demand keeps growing. Management Information Specialist, Allison Vitorino hopes that one day, every department will have access to information \u201cat the snap of their fingers.\u201d Tableau: What was the impact of Tableau within your company? Alisson Vitorino, Management Information Specialist:: It was very positive. We needed a tool that almost all sectors would use. In addition to facilitating its distribution, it also serves to unify company numbers and company data, facilitating everyone's job. Tableau came to help and is helping today. Tableau: How did you decide on Tableau? Can you tell us about your implementation? Alisson: The Tableau implementation in Wine was very smooth. It was picked after testing all tools in the market. Tableau was chosen for its ease and simplicity of use, while also taking into consideration the other sectors that would also use the tool. So it was a very simple implementation. Tableau: What kind of challenges were you facing? How did Tableau help you resolve them? Alisson: The same issues common to all businesses: using information, information that everyone can access and share the same numbers and the same data. We did not have this, so we were seeking to resolve this issue and with the help of Tableau, we are on the right path. Today, information is already unified and everyone can access the same data in the same place, thanks to Tableau. Tableau: What metrics are you analyzing in Tableau? Alisson: [We are analyzing metrics] such as sales and inventory. Inventory, incidentally, gave us a lot of work because each area had different data. Now with Tableau, we have a unique data source and everyone accesses the same information. Tableau: And what would you say to someone who is considering using Tableau? Alisson: I would say that you can test all of the available tools in the market, but you will find that only Tableau is so simple and easy to use for any type of user, whether they are in BI or another sector. Tableau: How did you learn about Tableau? Alisson: In 2012, when the BI sector was created within Wine, we started looking for a tool that would be simple and at the same time, useful for the company. We thereby were searching out all available options and testing them. The idea was always to find one that everyone could use and not just the BI area. That's how we arrived at Tableau, because of its simplicity and ease of operation. Today, seven or eight sectors of the company are using Tableau and the only link between them is our database. We unify the information and they use it quickly and easily. Tableau: What is your goal with Tableau? Alisson: The main objective is to further spread unified information within the company. Today, we have three users who use Tableau Desktop and five who use Online. And the idea is to extend this use to the rest of the company, so that everyone will have access to information at the snap of their fingers. Our goal is to eliminate as many reports as we can being produced by IT, transferring their production to the BI area. We will use Tableau to address this task, thereby freeing IT to focus on other projects. Tableau: How has Wine benefited from Tableau Cloud? Alisson: Tableau Cloud has helped add even greater use of the tool. In our case, Online users are those people who usually only need to view data and not manipulate them. So we have created some dashboards for them in which they can create filters as they need. Desktop is more focused on the strategic issues of data analysis itself. The goal is that both groups can access the information in a unified way and walk on their own two feet, reducing their dependence on the BI area."

        "content": "REA Group operates Australia's leading residential and commercial property websites, including realestate.com.au and realcommercial.com.au, along with other popular sites across the globe. In video 1, Stacy Sterling, Marketing Analytics Manager, shares how Tableau allows employees to easily see and interpret their own data and better contextualize business goals. And with Tableau Server, REA can share real-time data on screens all over the business. In video 2, Stacy explains how decentralizing data access results in empowered, more solution-oriented stakeholders in the marketing department. Executives can see all of the data in a central location for faster, better decision making. As more users engage with data, Stacy says that \u201canalytics are now in the hands of people who understand the business context the best.\u201d Tableau: Can you describe one of your company goals? Stacy Sterling, Marketing Analytics Manager: Within the company, our motto for the consumer experience on the website is to make our property process simple, efficient, and stress-free. Tableau: What inspired your business intelligence (BI) solution? Stacy: What I wanted to do was take that way of thinking about our consumers and implement it into the way that we use our own data internally. This way, we can make sure that everyone has access to the data in an easy way and an understandable way so that they can use it to make their own decisions. Tableau: What type of data do you collect and analyze? Stacy: We're really lucky at REA as a digital company that we have so much of our own data. So we're collecting a bunch of website data in terms of consumer behavior, but we also have so much property data and a lot of external sources as well. Tableau: How do you share data across the company? Stacy: One great thing about being at a digital company is that we also have screens all over the business. So through Server, we can actually connect the dashboards in the business to live, real-time data. So anything that's getting updated, whether it's traffic data or whether it's brand health data can be seen on screens throughout the business. We also have a community page that is serviced through Jive. And we've integrated Tableau Server within that so that people can log into a page and see overall company metrics through that as well. Tableau: How do you manage security? Stacy: We've used Server to control the permissions of who can see what, so that it creates a safe environment while still being quite open and transparent. Tableau: How do users benefit from having enhanced control of their data in your organization? Stacy: I think what's been critical about the users actually having control of their own data is that the analytics are now in the hands of the people who understand the business context the best. Tableau: Has this had a personal impact on you? Stacy: To get the users within the business to realize how data can inform their own actions is one of the best parts of my job. Tableau: How would you describe the \u201cTableau story\u201d at REA Group? Stacy: So the Tableau story at REA is one of decentralization. So with decentralization, our BI team has worked closely with the different stakeholders across the business to empower us to use certain types of data. Tableau: Who are the stakeholders, and what kind of data do you use? Stacy: Primarily, I work with stakeholders within the marketing team, and we're responsible for brand advertising, tracking brand health, making sure that we get traffic to our site. Tableau: What kinds of changes do you notice once the stakeholders gain more control over data? Stacy: So when my stakeholders have the direct access to the data that they want to see, and they get to have this engagement with it and play around and explore it with themselves, I think they feel a deeper connection to it. And I think it feels more relevant to them. Tableau: So, how does this autonomy contribute to better business results? Stacy: Unlocking the data and making sure that each person in the team gets to see it allows for every different perception to come in and bring in a different understanding of what's actually going on and how we can fix it. Tableau: Has Tableau has changed how your company does business? Stacy: Our executive leadership team now has access to the dashboards, and that's their primary source of business data all in one place, we've started to get lots of different requests top-down throughout the business for similar dashboards to be created for other lines of business, for specific products. So I can see Tableau really expanding within our company. Tableau: What was the workflow at your company before Tableau? Stacy: Previously, we had two Yellowfin report creators. And all of the requests for the business got funneled into those two people. And as you can imagine, it was quite a bottleneck. Tableau: Why did your team decide to use Tableau? Stacy: They landed on Tableau and started to use a few power users within the business who had been using the BI team the most for those requests to see if this tool would be suitable. Tableau: How long did it take to make that decision? Stacy: As a result of having a few people in the business who really felt like Tableau was doing a job that the company previously hadn't been able to do, we started to get a little bit of a groundswell for people who were demanding access to their own data as well. Tableau: What part does your BI team play specifically? Stacy: The relationship between the BI team and the rest of the business is that they'll provide support for Server, and they've also provided initial internal training and resources for any new users to get off the ground. We have a reporting guild within the company, which consists of Tableau users from all across the business. And it's a way that we can see internally what projects are being done and how different parts of the business use Tableau."

        "company": "Magazine Luiza",
        "content": "With more than 780 stores, 9 distribution centers, and 3 offices across 16 Brazilian states, Magazine Luiza is one of the largest retailers in the country. Magazine Luiza\u2019s Tableau deployment started in the sales planning and purchasing areas and is growing into other sectors like logistics and marketing. With Tableau consulting services, employees quickly familiarize themselves with the software\u2014allowing them to do analysis themselves. Today, with Tableau dashboards, reports that used to take up to three days are now available within hours. Tableau: What encouraged you and your company to implement Tableau? Roberto Montagner, Business Intelligence Coordinator: We started a BI project in late 2013, which aimed to work on both innovation as well as collaboration. We were seeking companies in the market that shared this working ideology and talked to several of them. Some had what we wanted, and others had deployed traditional marketing tools. At this point, through a Gartner Institute reference, we discovered Tableau and started running this project within our IT department. Tableau: Were you experiencing any specific problem? Roberto: Retail has a very different dynamic, which requires us to have information quickly, so that we can support the business areas in making forecasts, producing reports, making decisions etc. So we were looking in the market for a tool that could do this because often the information is embedded in a mass of data and people don\u00b4t know that. The objective of our BI project was to allow the user to view and access the most important data. The idea was to use a tool that allows anyone, even when making a mistake, to quickly fix the error until they get to the information they really wanted. Tableau: And how were you doing it before Tableau? Roberto:: We had some initiatives with traditional marketing tools. In other words, the business area was making requests to IT, who developed and returned it to the business area. But with the amount of information growing, that just increased the response time. Tableau: How was the start of the implementation, how has Tableau developed at the company? Roberto: Our goal was to implement a project that prioritized two main points: innovation and collaboration. In these respects, it was clear that Tableau could help us. In terms of collaboration, for example, from the beginning the consulting firm that worked with us, and even the Tableau team itself have always been very close to the company. One instance that really caught our attention was when Miguel (Nhuch), Vice President of Tableau, was at Magazine Luiza and took out his laptop and began to do a demo for our team. This was very important for us because it showed that Tableau really espouses the same philosophy that we were looking for, which is to broaden data access from IT staff all the way down to the end user. Tableau: Which departments use Tableau today? Roberto: Today Tableau is well distributed within the company. We started prioritizing some areas such as business and sales planning, which are two upfront areas, working a lot with the purchasing area. Now, other sectors are also using Tableau, such as logistics and marketing. Tableau: What problems has the Magazine Luiza staff resolved with Tableau? Roberto: Before, we had a really long delay in receiving detailed sales results or the results from some campaigns, for example. Today we can view them online in real-time or, in the very least, in near-time. In addition, some information that sometimes used to take two or three days to be compiled, is now prepared in a matter of hours. Tableau: How is Tableau particularly useful for your market? Roberto: The retail market requires quick responses. The faster we are able to make projections or work with the information before the competition, the more we benefit from it. In addition, one of the basic precepts of Magazine is to never keep up with the competition, but always be ahead of it. So all areas are pursuing this goal and IT is no different. Tableau: How long did it take to implement Tableau? Roberto: We started the project with Tableau at the end of 2013, contracts were signed in early 2014 and the proofs of concept (PoCs) that were run at the beginning of the project already served for the business area. That's because we created a very interesting model in which the final purchase decision for the tool was made by the user. PoCs were conducted with some traditional tools from the market. All were very similar technically and had very close scores. We then selected the two companies who had the best ratings in terms of what we wanted, we united the business areas along with these companies and we did a proof of concept of a product that these areas would like to have, with the objective of self-service BI. The two companies responded well, but Tableau stood out with regard to the usability of the product, and the business area made its decision. Tableau: How long did it take users to start generating dashboards? Roberto: About two or three weeks maximum. That was the time to install the Desktop versions on the machines, and for the staff to get started using it. Consulting helped us a lot in this They instructed one person to give the training and the initial guidelines. There was only the exponential distribution issue within the company. Tableau: What would you do if you didn't have Tableau? Roberto: We would continue with the traditional methods, but there would be many things we could not do due to the sheer volume of data. This means that we would continue with the slow process and have to do without some information that is now vital to the company, especially with regard to electronic commerce, for example."

The Office of Institutional Effectiveness publishes the data book to Tableau Server, giving leaders fast access to graduation and retention data. In video 2, Dmitri Rogulkin, Associate Director for the Office of Institutional Effectiveness, shares how the university brings Qualtrics survey data into Tableau using the Web Data Connector. In Tableau, university staff can filter survey data by demographic profiles and other factors. As a result, users like Dmitri spend more time exploring the needs of the university and less time crunching numbers. Tableau: Has Tableau impacted you personally? Dmitri Rogulkin, Associate Director for the Office of Institutional Effectiveness: I love Tableau. It makes my life easier. It saved a lot of time, a lot of resources. I love my job. And I go to my job every day very excited about new things I learn, about new things I do. And since I do like to help people, Tableau is the tool, the solution that helps me to do that. Tableau: What is the most popular Tableau workbook at the university? Dmitri: So one of the most popular or one of the most used dashboards is graduation and retention data. So graduation is a big topic on campus. Using the dashboard, they can see the baseline for graduation rate, and they can see how they progress towards the goal. And there was overwhelming support and encouragement to pursue this way. People were wowed! Tableau: How did you share this information before Tableau? Dmitri: So every year, at the end of the fall semester, we produce tables of data about students: number of students enrolled, number of students applied, various demographic profiles, social demographics, demographic breakdowns, retention and graduation rates, cost data such as pass rate, grade distribution. The resources that were used in the past to produce a data book, it would take the whole office, including the director. This time, it was done all by one person, just refreshing button on the Tableau interface. Tableau: Has this changed over time? Dmitri: So the way we were sharing our data book with end users on campus used to be the PDF version of tables and Excel spreadsheets. With Tableau Desktop, we produce everything in Tableau and, again, we [originally] had to PDF it and post it online. Tableau: How did Tableau Server change your processes? Dmitri: So one of the advantages or one of the values that Tableau Server installation brought to, in particular, to our office is it released our time. So now, the dashboard\u2014such as the data book that we publish to our website\u2014is almost completely automated. So we don't have to spend time on crunching the numbers, and we have more time to talk to the people. Tableau: Does that extend to other areas of the university? Dmitri: Using interactive dashboards online, our deans and chairs have access to that information. They can see how many total students [they may have] in that particular group who are ready to graduate. They can identify those students by name and e-mail information, and they can contact them. We are using it to communicate data and information to our end users, to our faculty, staff, and administrators. So here we have Tableau as the tool that facilitates that communication process. Tableau: What types of data do you analyze? Dmitri: A lot of data comes from surveys on our campus, students regularly surveyed by all different departments and units and divisions. And we use Qualtrics as a campus-wide solution to administer surveys. The dashboards that we're using with the survey data allows users to explore and filter survey items based on various demographic profiles. So it's very easy to see all the responses just for female or male students, or all the responses for white female students. So the dashboard format is a very efficient and effective way to communicate survey data. To share insights at the presentations, at the meetings. It\u2019s very quick, and it's very easy to produce, too. Tableau: Is it easier to analyze Qualtrics data now that you have Tableau? Dmitri: So we are excited, because anything that can be automated, anything that can be just on the fly, makes our life easier. So since we do use Qualtrics a lot and we have a huge database of Qualtrics data, it will now be quicker to produce dashboards. Tableau: Who builds these dashboards? Dmitri: We encourage end users, or what we call \"power users,\" to start building dashboard themselves. They have their own data sources, and now there is a tool that can effectively and efficiently help them to build their own analytics and share it. They're familiar\u2014such as department chairs or college deans\u2014they\u2019re familiar with their own problems and their situations. And they have access to that information, and they tend to start exploring and work in-depth. And it makes a difference. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted your day-to-day work? Dmitri: It simplified my life to such extent that it became a daily product and a tool that I'm using consistently. And because of it, I have a lot of time to do other stuff, such as meet people, talk to them, explore their needs, and come back with dashboards or analytics that they really need."

With Tableau, the operations team measures manufacturing processes to gauge success. And the team can easily analyze past trends and plan for the future. Eunice Lim, Senior Manager, Business Analytics, speaks about Seagate\u2019s inventory dashboard\u2014containing millions of data points. The dashboard captures finished goods that come into the warehouse, helping track inventory and reduce error. Tableau: What types of data does Seagate analyze with Tableau? Eunice Lim, Senior Manager, Business Analytics: We look at data from finance to quality data\u2014that means yield and failure analysis. Because we are in the storage business, we have drives, and we have systems. So, you know, anything that goes through the whole supply chain. So all the different departments, quality operations, inventory, HR, finance. Everything. So we look at processes, look at the flow of things, because we are in a manufacturing environment. [We look at] how smooth it can be from one station to another, and the time taken from one station to another. And also looking at anything that's quantifiable, measurable. So we just want to improve the measurements and make sure that we hit the target or even do better. Tableau: Can you give an example of a dashboard that helps Seagate achieve these goals? Eunice: Tableau also helps us in tracking the past trends, current trends, and also in predicting what's in the future so that we say, \u201cOkay, we think that if we continue this way, it might go this direction and what can we do to facilitate that or to reduce that tendency?\u201d We have an inventory dashboard. So the inventory dashboard captures the finished goods and all the different locations like supply and materials that come into our warehouse that are waiting to be used in the manufacturing process. It was 30 million\u201430,000 lines. And then, you know, inventory is ongoing. It just changes every minute. So we have managed to capture that in an inventory dashboard. And then, obviously, inventory is about money on hold. If you don't sell anything, if your materials are all lying around, nothing gets done. Then your money is stuck there, and you're not generating income. Tableau: Where would you be if you didn't have Tableau? Eunice: If I didn't start using Tableau, I would still be using Excel. I would still have a fear of data. And then I wouldn't have a bigger view of how data can help in my day-to-day work. Whereas with Tableau visuals, I will look at Tableau, look at the colors, look at the bars, and I look at the numbers. Because it's more fun in that way."

        "company": "iProperty",
        "content": "For more than eight years, iProperty.com has operated a group of property portals with a strong presence in Asia Pacific. The company offers a platform for property buyers and investors to search for their dream home, while offering real estate agents and property developers an avenue to effectively showcase their listings and developments. The site also allows for third party vendors such as financers and legal service providers to share information and services that assist property buyers and investors in making informed decisions. With over 4 million unique site visitors each month, iProperty sits on a large amount of data. The team behind the portals knew that there were valuable insights to be found. The newly-founded big data team initially tackled their data with Excel and then Power Map, a Microsoft product. They soon found that these tools could not effectively handle iProperty\u2019s large amounts of data. The two-person team was spending far too much time slicing and dicing data manually. Worse, the output was \u201cold school\u201d and lacked visual appeal. After discovering Tableau, the team was immediately sure that they found the right solution. The now six-person team delivers interactive visualizations to customers and the response has been gratifying. Additionally, divisions across the company are beginning to use Tableau to drive improvements internally. iProperty was sitting on a large amount of data\u2014approximately 1.5 million data points per day\u2014which they had collected over eight years. This data held the answers to many pertinent questions from developers, property agents, as well as property buyers and sellers. Questions like \u2018What is the right price for a property in a certain market?\u2019; \u2018What type of properties do consumers want to buy?\u2019; \u2018What sort of development would be suitable for a specific land parcel?\u2019 iProperty saw an opportunity to develop a new services arm that could provide consultation and projections to help customers make informed decisions. They knew that they could take disparate data\u2014location information, search terms from their websites, and more\u2014to develop truly valuable insights. iProperty Group\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) Harmit Singh formed a big data analytics team to look into the use of data. Initially, the team started working with Excel, but they soon found it to be limiting, as they could only work with a certain number of rows of data. Harmit commented: \u201cWe had to do a lot of slicing and dicing of data manually to fit our data into Excel and this took a lot of time. Also, the charts that we could create using Excel were rather \u2018old school\u2019 and not visually exciting.\u201d The team then tried to use Microsoft\u2019s Power Map. They also found it challenging to present the data visually, and the results they got were not as exciting as they would have liked them to be. People consuming the data also could not interact with it to ask more questions. The big data analytics team decided to look for a better solution. They knew that engaging, interactive visualizations are critical if they want to truly excite customers with these insights. The iProperty big data analytics team searched for a big data analysis tool online and came across Tableau. The team carried out internal trials comparing different tools and found Tableau to be the best fit for their needs. They were impressed with how Tableau could create eye-catching visualizations. Most importantly, Tableau\u2019s ease of use came up tops for them among the tools that were tested. Moreover, Tableau\u2019s ability to connect directly to internal databases that are storing data collected from the portal is a plus point for iProperty. With Tableau, the team can directly access their data stored in Microsoft SQL Server, as well as Google Analytics and Google BigQuery. Currently, the iProperty team uses Tableau Desktop to author interactive dashboards. They publish their work to Tableau Cloud, for collaboration within iProperty and for customer presentations. Customers or staff can look at the same datasets from a different angle or focus, asking more questions and finding their own answers. iProperty now provides business intelligence and insights gained from analytics done with Tableau. For instance, the company has introduced Agent Analytics to real estate agents who subscribe to iProperty. With Agent Analytics, property agents get in-depth analysis of the property market, helping them in their day-to-day business. Harmit said: \u201cCurrently, we have been bundling analytics into our existing products to provide value-add to our customers. We are also driving customer engagement with the data visualizations. In many cases, the data helps us get through the door and enables us to share about our other offerings. This would not have been possible without tools like Tableau.\u201d \u201cIn the future, we may package these visualizations into information or reports that developers will be able to buy, but it is a long journey and there is still much to be done before we get there,\u201d he shared. Internally, within iProperty, Harmit also expects Tableau usage to spread across different departments and divisions. Harmit said: \u201cInterestingly, we started out adopting Tableau to help our sales team sell better. But now, we are also looking inward to see how Tableau can benefit other teams who work with data. In IT, sometimes it is about driving innovation and using tools that other people are not using. When the other teams in Marketing, Finance, etc. see the benefits, it will catch their interest and they may gravitate towards Tableau.\u201d The team is now able to produce visual analyses much faster than before. In the past six months, they have developed more than 100 data visualization reports\u2014a pace that would not have been possible with previous tools. Even better, iProperty\u2019s sales teams are wowing customers with insights they are learning from interacting with Tableau dashboards. This has improved engagement\u2014and even opened doors for opportunities to share other iProperty offerings. Harmit said: \u201cIt\u2019s about driving decisions based on data. Tableau has been an enabler to us. You can do a many amazing things with the data behind the scenes, but you do need to be able to present it visually. To me, data is quite useless unless you can allow people to visualize it easily and effectively.\u201d Furthermore, Tableau has enhanced the data culture within iProperty. \u201cTableau has raised the bar and now people within the company expect more from their data. People see what others have done using Tableau and realize, \u2018Hey, I can use that in my area as well\u2019,\u201d Harmit observed. Finally, Harmit shared that he now recommends the use of Tableau to anyone, from within iProperty or other organizations, who wants to or is working with data."

Their criteria: An interactive analytics platform that would be quick to deploy, wouldn\u2019t require a dedicated infrastructure, and that offered watertight security\u2014including the data being hosted in a European data center. They chose Tableau Cloud. Now more than 200 Macfarlan Smith employees can access fast, self-service data insight built on trusted data sources. The bottom line? Macfarlan Smith now has discussions about its data\u2014not about the issues surrounding data integration and data quality. Macfarlan Smith has earned its place in medical history. The company held a royal appointment to provide medicine to Her Majesty Queen Victoria and supplied groundbreaking obstetrician Sir James Simpson with chloroform for his experiments in pain relief during labor and delivery. Today, Macfarlan Smith is a subsidiary of the Fine Chemical and Catalysts division of Johnson Matthey plc. The pharmaceutical manufacturer specializes in producing opiate narcotics such as codeine and morphine. Every day, Macfarlan Smith is making decisions based on its data. They collect and analyze manufacturing operational data, for example, to allow them to meet continuous improvement goals. Sales, marketing and finance rely on data to identify new pharmaceutical business opportunities, grow revenues and satisfy customer needs. Additionally, the company\u2019s manufacturing facility in Edinburgh needs to monitor, trend and report quality data to assure the identity, quality, and purity of its pharmaceutical ingredients for customers and regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and others as part of Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). The process of gathering that data, making decisions and reporting was not easy though. The data was scattered across the business: including in the company\u2019s bespoke enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform, inside legacy departmental databases such as SQL, Access databases, and standalone spreadsheets. When that data was needed for decision making, excessive time and resources were devoted to extracting the data, integrating it and presenting it in a spreadsheet or other presentation outlet. Data quality was another concern. Because teams relied on their own individual sources of data, there were multiple versions of the truth and conflicts between the data. And it was sometimes hard to tell which version of the data was correct and which wasn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t stop there. Even once the data had been gathered and presented, it was slow and difficult to make changes \u2018on the fly.\u2019 In fact, whenever a member of the Macfarlan Smith team wanted to perform trend or other analysis, the changes to the data needed to be approved. The end result being that the data was frequently out of date by the time it was used for decision making. Liam Mills, Head of Continuous Improvement at Macfarlan Smith highlights a typical reporting scenario: \u201cOne of our main reporting processes is the \u2018Corrective Action and Preventive Action\u2019, or CAPA, which is an analysis of Macfarlan Smith\u2019s manufacturing processes taken to eliminate causes of non-conformities or other undesirable situations. Hundreds of hours every month were devoted to pulling data together for CAPA\u2014and it took days to produce each report. Trend analysis was tricky too, because the data was static. In other reporting scenarios, we often had to wait for spreadsheet pivot table analysis; which was then presented on a graph, printed out, and pinned to a wall for everyone to review.\u201d Slow, labor-intensive reporting processes, different versions of the truth, and static data were all catalysts for change. \u201cMany people were frustrated because they believed they didn\u2019t have a complete picture of the business,\u201d says Mills. \u201cWe were having more and more discussions about issues we faced\u2014when we should have been talking about business intelligence reporting.\u201d One of the Macfarlan Smith team had previous experience of using Tableau and recommended Mills explore the solution further. A free trial of Tableau Cloud quickly convinced Mills that the hosted interactive data visualization solution could conquer the data battles they were facing. \u201cI was won over almost immediately,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ease of use, the functionality and the breadth of data visualizations are all very impressive. And of course being a software-as-a-service (SaaS)-based solution, there\u2019s no technology infrastructure investment, we can be live almost immediately, and we have the flexibility to add users whenever we need.\u201d One of the key questions that needed to be answered concerned the security of the online data. \u201cOur parent company Johnson Matthey has a cloud-first strategy, but has to be certain that any hosted solution is completely secure. Tableau Cloud features like single sign-on and allowing only authorized users to interact with the data provide that watertight security and confidence.\u201d The other security question that Macfarlan Smith and Johnson Matthey wanted answered was: Where is the data physically stored? Mills again: \u201cWe are satisfied Tableau Cloud meets our criteria for data security and privacy. The data and workbooks are all hosted in Tableau\u2019s new Dublin data center, so it never leaves Europe.\u201d Following a six week trial, the Tableau sales manager worked with Mills and his team to build a business case for Tableau Cloud. The management team approved it almost straight away and a pilot program involving 10 users began. The pilot involved a manufacturing quality improvement initiative: looking at deviations from the norm, such as when a heating device used in the opiate narcotics manufacturing process exceeds a temperature threshold. From this, a \u2018quality operations\u2019 dashboard was created to track and measure deviations and put in place measures to improve operational quality and performance. \u201cThat dashboard immediately signaled where deviations might be. We weren\u2019t ploughing through rows of data\u2014we reached answers straight away,\u201d says Mills. Throughout this initial trial and pilot, the team used Tableau training aids, such as the free training videos, product walkthroughs and live online training. They also participated in a two-day \u2018fundamentals training\u2019 event in London. According to Mills, \u201cThe training was expert, precise and pitched just at the right level. It demonstrated to everyone just how intuitive Tableau Cloud is. We can visualize 10 years\u2019 worth of data in just a few clicks.\u201d The company now has five Tableau Desktop users, and up to 200 Tableau Cloud licensed users. Mills and his team particularly like the Tableau Union feature in Version 9.3, which allows them to piece together data that\u2019s been split into little files. \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes hard to bring together the data we use for analysis. The Union feature lets us work with data spread across multiple tabs or files, reducing the time we spend on prepping the data,\u201d he says. By standardizing on Tableau Cloud, Macfarlan Smith has transformed the speed and accuracy of its decision making and business reporting. This includes: Following this initial success, Macfarlan Smith is now extending Tableau Cloud out to financial reporting, supply chain analytics and sales forecasting. Mills concludes, \u201cOur business strategy is now based on data-driven decisions, not opinions. The interactive visualizations enable us to spot trends instantly, identify process improvements and take business intelligence to the next level. I\u2019ll define my career by Tableau.\u201d"

As part of their service offering, eClerx helps clients understand digital marketing channels, analyzing data from email campaigns, social media, search engine optimization, and website visits. With Tableau, eClerx\u2019s analytics team can bring all of the data into one view\u2014increasing conversion rates. Employees now create reports within a day\u2014up to four days faster than before\u2014and clients have fast access to insights. \u201cToday I can do a lot more with the data,\u201d says Sandeep Srivastava, Associate Principal, Centre of Excellence\u2014Analytics & Insights at eClerx. Tableau: What benefits has Tableau brought eClerx? Sandeep Srivastava, Associate Principal, Centre of Excellence\u2014Analytics & Insights, eClerx: I think with Tableau, the one thing that has happened is it has made the whole analysis very easier and faster. Today I can do a lot more with the data, which I couldn't even think of in the past, or even I did not dare to do in the past. Tableau: Can you share a little bit about eClerx? Sandeep: We are a services organization, so there are two things that we do. One is more for the internal audience, internal users, and the other one is more for our clients. Internally, we have an enterprise setup where a lot of internal functions like HR, corporate finance, the things they use. Tableau: What challenges were you facing before Tableau? Sandeep: So when we adopted Tableau, the kind of challenges we were facing, firstly, because of the different reports being produced by different teams and all those numbers matching and tying up, we addressed that issue by having one centralized team working on Tableau and the data flow into Tableau and everyone getting the same copy through the enterprise setup. So that's how we got the unified view across the organization. Tableau: Have you seen things improve? Sandeep: I think the whole simplification happened. And obviously the speed definitely improved as well. That's how in the post-Tableau world we are seeing a lot of benefits coming in from the consumption of those reports. Tableau: What kind of data do you analyze on the client side? Sandeep: So on the digital marketing side, as you know, there are multiple channels for acquisition of the customers. There are e-mails, there are social media, there are searches, website. So the data is coming in from various disparate sources. So blending the data from various sources, integrating them, and getting insights on what customers are doing and how we can get them through our door and acquire them and convert them into our customers. That is what we're doing through analytics. And Tableau is helping us along the way in visualizing the information, which is coming from various channels at one place and in a very cozy manner. Tableau: Have you noticed time savings? Sandeep: It used to take three or four days, or even more than that at times. But now that's like within a day or even less than a day. I think that's the kind of improvement we have seen. Tableau: What advice would you give to someone considering Tableau? Sandeep: One tiny baby step, and Tableau offers us to make that baby step. And once you make that step, I'm sure you would start running after that. It's a good place to begin with and once you start using it, it will be very tough to be away from it."

Thanks to the quality of its products and the success of its advertising campaigns (who could forget Garoto Bombril, played by actor Carlos Moreno), Bombril products are in millions of homes across the country\u2014and the demand keeps growing. With Tableau, pricing analysts at Bombril can account for rising demand because they can quickly scan Tableau dashboards to discover answers. They can easily filter by region and product to determine the best price, highest volume, and largest customers. As Davi Capato do Nascimento, Controller-Pricing puts it\u2014with Tableau, analysts can now \u201ccreate a thousand and one ideas.\u201d Tableau: Davi, what encouraged you and your company to try Tableau? Davi Capato do Nascimento, Controlling\u2013Pricing: Using Tableau grew out of our need to improve our operational productivity. We were facing a very large demand, which had been growing, and our chief financial officer asked to improve our performance even further. With Tableau and with all the support we receive from the company, we generate various situations of analysis reports. Tableau: Was it easy to implement Tableau? Davi: It was very smooth. We counted on the Tableau support staff for help. We presented ideas for creating reports and dashboards, and achieved a result that met the demand. From that point onward, we made reports on profitability of customers and products available to the commercial area, which was our focus at that time. Tableau: How is Tableau useful and what has changed in your day to day job? Davi: In the pricing area, our job is to analyze what happens in relation to the sales made by Bombril for its customers. So, I can find out who has the best price, the highest volume, the largest customer etc. With Tableau, we do a very specific evaluation of each region or each product we have in the portfolio. Tableau: What would happen if you didn\u00b4t have Tableau? Davi: Without Tableau it\u2019s likely that the demands of work would have us working up to 12 hours a day. We came to a point at which the information database was so huge and the need to see a quick return for the commercial area was so intense, that either we implemented a new tool to help us in this process or our workload would increase. Fortunately, we found Tableau, which was a success. Tableau: And what would you say to someone who was considering using Tableau today? Davi: I would say that the tool supports your needs and more, because the actual work process itself becomes very easy and your everyday job ends up being much more analytical. The tool gives you the support you need to create a thousand and one ideas and achieve your goal."

Business Intelligence Manager, Ameer Hashish shares how customers can download mobile data through TUNE\u2019s Tableau Server and analyze it in Tableau Desktop. Using Tableau's data connectors, customers can bring in campaign data from sources like MySQL, Oracle, Salesforce, or Google Analytics. In video 2, Jim Tommaney, Director of Data Insights explains how TUNE balances flexibility and security. Individuals have assigned permissions in Tableau Server, ensuring data security in their multi-tenant environment. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted TUNE\u2019s customers? Ameer Hashish, Business Intelligence Manager: Specific to mobile marketers, Tableau has opened up a lot of ah-ha moments in terms of process automation, how they match cost and spend data to the revenues that are generated within an app, how they can dig deeper into geographic data and analyze their campaigns at a zip code level; how they can create advanced level cohorts to determine the value to the users after several pre-engagements or campaigns that have been run against them. Tableau: Can you tell us about TUNE BI? Ameer: TUNE already has an existing platform for advertisers where they can log in and see their data. We built TUNE BI as a response to market demand for more flexible customization of data visualization and access to more granular insights. Tableau: Why did you choose to embed Tableau into the offering? Ameer: One of the key strengths of Tableau and why we chose Tableau is that it allowed for easy integration of third party data sources. So we've got clients who have the mobile data, data that's coming off of the device. And they want to match that data against the campaign data that they run on desktops. We've got other clients who have existing databases, like MySQL or Oracle, and they want to plug in that data directly to the mobile data and blend it together to discover the relationships. So we've got clients using Google Analytics, MySQL database connections, Salesforce. We've got clients automating cost data collection. It's a whole host and range of different data sources that our advertisers are using. Tableau: Can you explain how customers use Tableau within TUNE BI? Ameer: In terms of customers, it's really enabled our customers to create data visualizations specific to their business immediately. So a typical advertiser would open up Tableau Desktop connect to our Tableau Server pick out some data sources available to them that relate to their business, their mobile data, and they can plug and play and begin to create visualizations. And then we extend them the publishing rights to publish the reports that they create back to the Tableau Server. Tableau: What is one of your customers\u2019 favorite Tableau features? Ameer: The mapping feature is one of the features that our advertisers like the most. We'd say Tableau has a distinct advantage over other analytics platforms in its advanced mapping capability. Specific to mobile apps, there are a lot of mobile apps that are food delivery services and are based on geography. And so geography and demographics play a huge part in profiling customers and determining what the target audience really looks like. And so that's been a huge success for us. Clients are finding that they can drive much deeper insight, much more granular insights by slicing and dicing those dimensions and measures a thousand different ways from Sunday and really giving them access to insight that they never had before. Tableau: Can you tell us a little bit about TUNE BI? Jim Tommaney, Director, Data Insights: Tableau's part of our project we're working on here within TUNE. We're offering TUNE BI, which is a capability to really use Tableau to get at the data and really drive insights and answer sort of the next question. Tableau: What Tableau products do you use? Jim: We\u2019re using all of Tableau, to be honest. We're using Tableau Server, we're using Tableau Desktop, we're using Tableau Cloud, we're using mobile capabilities of Tableau. We love Tableau because of all these capabilities. We use Tableau Server, we built out a set of insights, analytics for our customers, and we let them, you know, view that in whatever manner they see fit, right? So it's just a flexibility option for our customers. Tableau: What data do you connect to in Tableau? Jim: We\u2019re using a number of different technologies. TUNE uses probably more than a dozen different data technologies. We're using internally something called TUNE DB, which is a columnar database. We run it on Amazon, also on premise, but it allows for significant flexibility sort of to marry back to Tableau's flexibility. Tableau: How do you manage security? Jim: We have a shared customer, shared database with multi-customer, multi-tenant environment there. And so we have to manage security there in terms of what data they have access to and privileges. And so we just manage that. Right now, we create the individual users, privileges for each customer. They've got dedicated views that point to their data and are restricted from being changed. So Tableau actually gives us all the tools we need to deliver the right filters to ensure data security in our multi-tenant environment. Tableau: How big is your data set? Jim: We\u2019ve got hundreds of billions of rows in the data set. It's still not yet a petabyte of data, but it's going to get there. We're the growth curve is for both the data and the businesses is very nice, so we're real excited about that. So we'll cross that boundary soon. Dealing with big data is definitely a challenge. But Tableau gives us the tools to let us work through those challenges. Fast to Create. Fast to Market. Learn more about Tableau Embedded Analytics"

        "title": "Granite School District sees the big picture in student data",
        "company": "Granite School District",
        "content": "The Granite School District serves nine cities in the Salt Lake City region. Administrators wanted to increase visibility into student progress. With more than 60,000 students, that was a big ask. The IT department created student profile dashboards, pulling in data from their Microsoft SQL Server data warehouse. They share these dashboards through Tableau Server and embed them into the Granite School District portal. Today, students, parents, and administrators can view student data and quickly identify risk indicators. The can ask questions of the data to find the root cause of an issue and take corrective action. And the IT team can use its existing Active Directory profiles to set permissions\u2014ensuring that student data stays secure. With Tableau, student profiles are providing value to the entire district. From attendance records, test scores, and disciplinary actions to demographic information, the Granite School District had a wealth of information. But turning that data into actionable insight was a challenge. School administrators wanted to see more information about the district, measure multiple performance metrics, and diagnose issues at a higher level. Administrators got a variety of narrow reports but were left using gut instinct to decide what the reports meant in aggregate. Eventually, administrators became so frustrated waiting for timely reporting that they stopped asking for the data entirely. \u201cIf you've got to go to multiple sources to get the data, it can be difficult to get a coherent feel for what's going on,\u201d says Kim Brunnenmeyer, System Administrator for the Granite School District. In addition, says Craig Schow, Business Consultant for the Granite School District, \u201cOne of the big frustrations our teachers had was spending all this time testing students. We\u2019d make them do SAGE tests, and DIBELS tests, and SRI and more, and then the teachers wouldn't always get the data from that. They\u2019d ask, \u2018Why am I spending all of this educational time giving them an assessment and then I don't get timely results to change how I teach?\u2019\u201d And when teachers did get testing data back, the information lacked important context. Teachers struggled to compare one year\u2019s results to the next. They also couldn\u2019t view scores alongside proficiency expectations that would help them place a student\u2019s score into perspective. \u201cThey could see a score was 248, for example, but they couldn\u2019t see what that meant in terms of approaching standard,\u201d Craig says. To solve these problems, Granite School District first used the reporting functionality within their single sign-on solution\u2014offering visual reports with drill-down capabilities. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t enough to meet the district\u2019s needs. \u201cYou could look at a pie chart of the ethnic breakdown of the district, for example, then go look at a pie chart or a bar graph of something else. But it could only do one thing at a time. So it didn't present a very good overall picture of anything,\u201d Kim explains. This made important efforts like identifying at-risk students slow and difficult. The At-Risk Reports that the original system could deliver were static and inflexible. Worse, teachers weren\u2019t able to dig down into the underlying issues. Kim continues, \u201cWe ran some reports that tried to identify at risk students. But it wasn't in the same place as we could see other stuff. You could run an At-Risk Report and see who was at risk, but then you would have to go elsewhere to find more detail as to why they were at risk.\u201d This lack of visibility into student\u2019s academic careers even affected the athletic programs. Coaches couldn\u2019t pull a list of who was eligible to play, and had to rely on word of mouth from the teachers. The school district needed a tool where they could see all of their data in one place\u2014with richer analytical depth. One day, when working with a United Way worker on a school program, Kim saw an interesting visualization on the screen. This was Kim\u2019s first exposure to Tableau. Craig\u2019s first look at his data in Tableau was an eye-opener: \u201cI had a lot of predetermined expectations of what the results would look like. When I saw the data in Tableau, it was reversed from what I had expected. That made me want to look into that data a little bit more and understand why I had this preconceived notion.\u201d When Dale Roberts, Director of Information Systems did some research, he was pleased by Tableau\u2019s robust analytics and the ability to create multiple views within a workbook. Data from the school\u2019s student information system (SIS), Discovery, is aggregated and stored in Microsoft SQL Server. The IT team uses the Microsoft SQL Server native connector to analyze data in Tableau Desktop. Publishing analyses\u2014like their student profile dashboards\u2014 to Tableau Server also allows them to embed the dashboards into the Granite School District Student Information Service portal. These student profiles show a comprehensive view of students\u2019 academic careers within the district. And Tableau Server permissions allow IT to restrict access on an individual basis. Craig points out, \u201cWe have close to 100,000 people who could log in at any time and see data.\u201d This 100,000 includes parents and guardians, students, and staff members. To manage access, the team set up a .NET web application to generate trusted tickets between Tableau and the database, essentially \u201cpiggybacking\u201d off of the security profiles already created in the SIS. Today, administrators can rely on facts rather than assumptions or long-standing beliefs about school performance\u2014and better plan where to expend efforts for maximum results. For example, Craig points out, \u201cThe general assumption is that seniors slack off in their last year. But with this data, we can see that more 10th graders are having an issue with grades as opposed to the seniors.\u201d The student portal, backed by Tableau, has been a key tool for everyone concerned with a student\u2019s scholastic progress. \u201cStaff members at schools have access to this. Students have access to this. And then also contacts for students have access to it. So if I'm a parent or guardian, I could go in and see this for any kids I have in the school system,\u201d explains Craig. Granite School District\u2019s student profiles provide value to the entire district. Administrators can plot demographic data along with scholastic achievement data to give officials a deeper insight into issues around the students\u2019 environment. With these dashboards, teachers and administrators can see early warning signs of struggling students and allow the district to take timely, corrective action. Craig explains, \u201c[Teachers and administrators] can see student GPAs. They can also hover over and see if a particular student has multiple risk indicators. For example, if they're an ESL student, English is a second language for them, and that may be part of the barrier if their GPA is low, or if they've failed quite a few courses.\u201d Tableau Server helps ensure that standardized test results are available to teachers in time for them to make use of the information. Kim says that Tableau has delivered value on multiple levels. He comments, \u201cWith Tableau\u2026we didn't have to spend all our money for just one feature. With Tableau, we could create a lot of different things.\u201d"

Decision makers at food banks are turning to dashboards to quickly identify needs and understand where to focus their efforts. With faster access to data, food banks can focus on what they do best\u2014relieving hunger. Tableau: Can you tell us about your work at Feeding America? Melinda Resser, Director of Analytics: I mean, if you tried to conjure in your mind who was food insecure, you might not get to that person because one in seven people in this country are food insecure. I mean, it\u2019s one thing to say 49 million are food insecure\u2014but one in seven. So look around. Somebody that you're sitting near is food insecure. Ross Fraser, Director of Media Relations: Feeding America is a network of 200 food banks\u2014most of the food banks in the country. Those food banks provide food to 61,000 food pantries, soup kitchens, and other agencies. So any given week of the year, more than five million people each week will come to us for a meal. Tableau: What type of data do you analyze in Tableau? Melinda: We source food from big brand manufacturers, from produce growers, we pick up food from retail stores, and we help distribute that. All of this costs money and all of this is donated funds. So we\u2019re helping the food banks analyze how much does it cost them to source a pound of food? How much does it cost them to distribute it? What is their inventory turns in their warehouses? So all of these things are data points that we collect and report out. Tableau: What inspired you to use Tableau? Melinda: We didn\u2019t think that our food banks were consuming the data the way that we would like. We found out that they were looking at the spreadsheets and saying, \u201cSo?\u201d One of my staff found Tableau and brought it to my attention, and as soon as I saw it, I said, \u201cThis is beyond a map! This is great! We need this, we need to get this.\u201d Tableau: What type of dashboards have you created? Melinda: The first visualizations we did was a dashboard, which we called the Performance Benchmarking Dashboard. We don\u2019t think we could\u2019ve rendered that in anything but Tableau. The vizzes are showing them where the distribution patterns are, where the need is, so that they can focus on those areas. There are a lot of moving pieces\u2014a lot of moving pieces. This will help foodbanks see those pieces in an easier way than a spreadsheet would do. Ross: It helps us visualize where the food is, where we need to take the food, who\u2019s hungry, where they\u2019re hungry, and how we can be much more efficient and get more food to hungry people. Melinda: 49 million people will thank you, and we thank you too."

Adrian: One of the ways that we've been able to use Tableau to make more data-driven decisions is to have those quick touch bases with leadership where leadership comes to us and asks, \"Hey, I have a problem. I know you have the data. Come with me for 30 minutes and let's explore.\" We're able to take the data to the office and bring out those stories, whether that's true highlighting different pieces or discovering things within the data that really speak to that problem. Tableau: How do you share insights? Adrian: We build dashboards for a lot of people across the entire organization. Leadership, for the most part, would be our customers. But we also build dashboards for people who are kind of the project owners who are really looking at the day to day for each initiative. Tableau: How did you get leadership buy-in to roll out Tableau across the organization? Adrian: One of the ways that we were able to get leadership buy-in to grow Tableau was to show that speed to insight in real time. As opposed to saying, \u2018oh, you know, give us a few minutes to get back to you and I'll pull that data really quickly.\u2019 It's invaluable when you're able to create that in such a short amount of time that, you know, most of the time, leadership is still amazed by how quickly we can pull together visualizations. I will say that there have probably been a number of different instances where seeing how much we're utilizing Tableau in all of our different reporting and dashboards and self-service tools has really impacted leadership's view on the tool itself. Tableau: What has been the impact of Tableau? Adrian: The way that people in Walmart stores are impacted by Tableau is really the initiatives that are rolled out and are measured using Tableau. We're able to really tell a bit more of a story, as opposed to more static views, and longer-term views that really help leadership understand the strategy behind the initiative. Tableau: Can you give us an example of one of your Tableau dashboards? Adrian: One of the dashboards that we created last year was one that really looked at culture across all of the different countries that Walmart has a presence in. The way that we built it was very simple, it was a very quick engagement. It was something that was needed on a pretty short timeline. And by putting together that data and throwing it onto Tableau, we were able to just pull in the map and pull up the data on culture dimensions and have, you know, all these different culture dimensions right there within the day. It took more time to collect the data than it did to visualize. Tableau: Has Tableau changed the way you do data analysis at Walmart? Adrian: Tableau has changed some of the ways that we do our initial dive into the data. I will say that when it comes to the specifics of, \u2018hey, let's take a look at how we cut this,\u2019 it's made it a lot easier to make those cuts on the fly as opposed to going back and re-running the data with a different split or multiple splits and trying to tell a story that way. Versus, let's say, you know, if you have a whole bunch of data and you're splitting it out in a way that makes the most sense to you, but might not make the most sense to your customer right at that point. Tableau: Can you speak about your Tableau deployment in Global People Analytics? Adrian: So this was for, you know, one of those, \u2018hey, we've got to go, we've got to go\u2019 type projects. It's one of those projects that really had a short timeline and we needed to get the insight to the customer, to the leader, just on a really quick turnaround. And what we were able to do as we started building out the dashboard was, you know, we'd built it in a kind of community-oriented way. The entire project team was in the room and I started pulling data from all of the different data sets that we'd compiled and putting it up on the screen. Tableau: You did this right in the room as they asked the questions? Adrian: We were able to, you know, pull together some key insights that leadership were really surprised to find out. Can't say what they are, but once we kind of flipped the graph a little bit, we were able to highlight some things that had previously never even crossed some of the project teams' minds. And were able to tell the story out of the same data, but in a very different and interesting way. Tableau: How has the use of Tableau grown at Walmart? Adrian: This is one of my favorite parts about knowing Tableau is when I go to somebody who I've worked with before and I show them, hey, look at what I can do with this tool. And the reaction is almost always, \"Where can I get that? Because I'd be really interested in using that in my own work.\u201d Since the 2009 proof of concept with Tableau, we went pretty quickly from 950 Desktop licenses within the first six months to what is now I think close to 5,000 Desktop licenses in the company."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Hudson is a talent management consultancy, helping companies understand employee strengths and improve hiring processes. Consultants use Tableau Cloud to showcase projects in the office and on the go. Instead of long reports, consultants create beautiful dashboards. Clients can now quickly understand the data and explore unanswered questions. Within a year of using Tableau, Hudson noticed improved communication with clients across the world, transforming the way they see and understand data. Tableau: How do your consultants use Tableau at Hudson? Viren Thakrar, Regional Research Development & Innovation Manager: We are a consulting firm. So our clients don't necessarily sit in the same physical building as us. Our consultants will often need to go out to clients to showcase, \u201cokay, we've done this people project with you. Here's a dashboard that we've built.\u201d Tableau: What are some benefits that you\u2019ve experienced? Viren: We can grab a coffee, we can have the iPad open, and they can start firing questions at us and we can use the dashboard on a tablet to answer the customer questions. So the ability to be really mobile and present data kind of anywhere is really essential. We're a global company, but this particular solution really relates to our Asia-Pacific region. So we, again, need to be able to deploy dashboards across China, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong really easily. So [Tableau] Online really enables us to do that. Tableau: How has Tableau changed your relationship with clients? Viren: The best thing is the time we now have and the format the data comes in. It means we have really cool conversations with our clients now. So instead of them going, \"oh, what does that mean over there and what does this mean over there?\" you skip all of that and you actually start going on to really interesting conversations like, \u201cah, that person that's sitting in the bottom-left-hand corner there, tell us about why that is. What can we do with this individual? Oh, that person that's sitting in the top-right-hand quadrant over there, what can we do with them?\u201d So the conversation progresses much further and much better and adds much more value to the client as well. Tableau: Has your workflow changed? Viren: As a talent organization, we've got a whole range of techniques we can use to understand an individual's strengths and development areas. The key, then, is bringing all that data together in a really easy-to-use fashion for the client. So whereas traditionally we might give them a 30-40 page report saying, these are all your different cohorts, this is where their strengths are, this is where their development areas are. What we can do now is just build a beautiful story and a beautiful dashboard to walk them through what are our strengths? What are our development areas? Where are my stars? And where can I invest my training and development budget to build for the future? And as I say, the next part of that is I can pick this up again in a year and that data's still got a lot of utility by being able to use filters and things like that, say, look our environment has changed, our context changed, and the data kind of magically changes in front of their eyes as well, which is really cool. Tableau: How do clients generally react to Hudson\u2019s Tableau dashboards? Viren: I think from an engagement perspective, it's fantastic. I love the ability to create that wow factor. If I'm going on a visit with a client to talk them about their people data, if I'm talking to consultants about data that we've got internally, to just be able to see the reaction when people say, \u201cwow, that's really cool.\u201d Just completely being able to transform what we did with data a year\u2014in just a space of a year\u2014to what we're able to do with it now is really awesome."

Non-technical business users can easily access data in Tableau Desktop, giving them fast insight into business processes. With Tableau Server, Cerved can share real-time analytics across the business. This centralized data access gives the company a single source of truth\u2014something that Andrea Omodeo, KPI Manager, says is \u201cno trivial matter.\u201d Tableau: Tell us a little bit about Cerved Group. How does Cerved approach data? Stefano Gatti, Innovation and Data Sources Manager: Our company's mission is, we want to give our customers support tools to make decisions, so our business claim is \"to know, in order to decide,\" and we found in Tableau one of the tools to support this knowledge. Cerved Group, besides being a big data company, is primarily a smart data company. In the sense that we have an important quantity of data, about eight hundred terabytes. Tableau: Why did you consider Tableau? Stefano: We were looking for a tool that would be agile, lean and very easy to introduce in both existing projects and processes and new ones that we were starting, so we tried Tableau. Tableau: Where does Cerved store data? Andrea Omodeo, KPI Manager: We have several database technologies in Cerved, to name the main ones, we have: Oracle, Teradata, MySQL and several other non-relational data sources. We have some supplies that still arrive in TXT format or, in any case, in formats that require attention and need \"massaging,\" so to say, before you can load them and use them; with Tableau, all this has become much easier. Tableau: Why did you choose Tableau over other tools? Andrea: So Tableau was the right solution because it has the possibility to connect in an almost automatic, transparent way to all the databases that we had, and this has allowed me to integrate all of the data sources that I needed. Stefano: One of the things that was most important and that helped us with Tableau, was the ease of use and the ease of set up, especially for non-IT people (people that are not developers). It has allowed a sort of democratization of data. Tableau: How does Cerved benefit from Tableau Server? Stefano: Tableau Server allows us to provide users with a tool for real time metrics and analytics. This means we are not only working on a static photograph, but allows users who need to interact, even several times a day, or several times during the working week, with data that changes, that grows, that decreases, but in any case describes very dynamic phenomena. Andrea: The Tableau Server centralizes data access, so, I can guarantee that all my users see the same version of the data extracted at the same time, it is no trivial matter; before you often had to chase after versions of reports to ensure that everyone saw the same version at the same time. Tableau: What would happen if you didn\u2019t have Tableau? Stefano: Today, living without Tableau in Cerved would be a problem because it would take away all that dynamism, particularly dynamism for innovation in projects underway, which is due to the ease with which the data we see and analyze on Tableau guide us in making certain choices in the project; so, I would prefer a life with Tableau. Andrea: With Tableau, I have more time to concentrate on the heart of the matter, and the tasks surrounding this are solved practically automatically."

Marieke van Woerkom, Manager of Business Intelligence & Data Analysis explains how she can now focus on more meaningful tasks, and everyone\u2019s work is now \u201csimply much more enjoyable.\u201d Tableau: Why did you choose Tableau over other business intelligence tools? Marieke van Woerkom, Manager, Business Intelligence & Data Analysis: Why did we choose Tableau? What made it stand out? I think it\u2019s the whole visual aspect. The fact that from a user\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s very easy to work with. People here work from a business perspective. They are very good at interpreting information but are not people who can program and they get on well with Tableau; they are people who are able to bring that information to the organization in a very accessible way, and I believe that was one of the criteria. Tableau: How did you analyze data before Tableau? Marieke: Before Tableau we used Excel. Occasionally, we still use Excel. This means we collated large dumps of information from our front office software via Cognos that we then processed in Excel, which meant that it was a task reliant on an individual. At some point, we concurred that yes, it\u2019s good in terms of developing KPIs but we need something more future-proof, which is when we came up with Tableau. Today, Tableau is what we use to present information to our clients, external customers and internal colleagues. So it\u2019s really a two-track policy Tableau offers. Tableau: How has your work changed now that you have Tableau? Marieke: It makes your work simply much more enjoyable. I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any less work, it will probably be replaced by something else, but it will be better and more meaningful. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted you personally? Marieke: I can take a day off because the information is no longer dependent on me. But also, I can provide our branches with the tools to delve into the information itself. I can provide my customers with the tools to delve into the information, to look at more than just figures. Added to that, it looks much slicker than lists of figures. Customers appreciate this too. And my work has become more enjoyable. Instead of listing figures, I now translate them. I am creating information, as opposed to just delivering long lists of figures. I only have to make information available and the rest takes care of itself, which makes my work more enjoyable. Making lists is boring. Translating the list into information, which is essentially what Tableau does, is what makes your work interesting. It makes our colleagues happy, which in turn makes us happy."

Danilo Vasconcelos de Souza, Professor, FIAP - Faculdade de Tecnologia: I am the professor of the MBA course on BI (Business Intelligence), specifically for technology and big data, which is a new course that we are working on in Brazil. I have a hands-on method for teaching Tableau. In the first lesson, I talk about some of the history, explain the goal, explain why merging a database with computer graphics and human interface is so important. Tableau: Why did you choose Tableau for your course? Danilo: With Tableau drag and drop, when I have a business problem, I ask a question and it answers me with a chart. It\u00b4s perfect. In the first class, students are already able to develop this. Tableau: How do you incorporate data storytelling? Danilo: As a final piece of work, I usually request a storytelling, where I ask them to search for information that is relative to and adds value to Brazilian society. And so they construct a storytelling. They set some parameters, which need to have at least two dashboards, some explanatory views, other exploratory views\u2014and they concatenate all of this into a story. Tableau: How do students react when they use Tableau? Danilo: I really see that they want to use Tableau in other disciplines, they want to use Tableau in the course completion work, in the final work. They want to take Tableau to the company they work for. Practical examples where you bring a business need, and that business need is resolved using Tableau\u2014I have no words to express how perfect it is for the students. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted your course? What are your plans for the future? Danilo: What I try to do is to merge theory with practice, and Tableau enables me to do that, without needing much knowledge or preparation time. Now, with the use of Tableau, in the last two years, I have felt that every day they like the course more and more. They love to interact with the course. I realize that the course has gained more fans, students are more excited to understand new things, and now I intend to add Vizable to the course. I can see it in my results, I can see it in the polls and in how much the students have enjoyed the course."

Jeff James, Senior Software Architect: Cerner has a relatively new product suite called HealtheIntent. And we're using Tableau as the primary method for showing visualizations, showing and delivering analytics out of that HealtheIntent platform. Tableau: Why did you choose Tableau? Jeff: We decided, ultimately, that we were going to use Tableau because we've done other systems, we've done build-it-yourself things and the return on investment on those other tools and the compelling visualizations that we can build with Tableau were just lacking from those other tools. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted Cerner? Peter Smart, Director of Reporting and Analytics: We're able to start using Tableau and turn around something that's aesthetically pleasing, that's producing value, that's actionable, that's drillable for our clients in matters of hours and days as opposed to taking weeks and months to go through a development cycle. Tableau: How does Tableau play a role in your sales process? Jeff: In general, the client feedback from the sales process has been very positive. You know, a number of our clients already use Tableau, so they're really happy that that's the direction that we've chosen to go. It's pretty slick. That's one of those things that, if you can engage with a client and quickly turn things around, it really changes the discussion from, you know, oh, it needs to go into the development queue and get prioritized and who knows when it's actually going to spit out of that queue? Tableau: What do your clients think when they see Tableau? Peter: They're real excited because they'll come up with an idea and we'll work through it and within a day or two, if not in that same meeting, we're actually delivering the information back to them. Tableau: Does that change the sales conversation? Jeff: So the reaction from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive. Clients that knew about Tableau, of course, they love it. Clients that don't or prospective clients that don't know about Tableau see the quick way that we can drill into data combined with the prettiness. And, you know, smiles immediately pop on their face. Tableau: And how is that impacting client relationships? Peter: I think it really leads to a lot more client satisfaction because they don't have to wait around. They don't have to trust that we're actually working on that stuff. It's there, it's coming, they can see that they're getting the results that they want in a much faster time frame. Jeff: The trick for me is ensuring that all of that becomes actionable in value-add and that we're not just creating pretty pictures. But, definitely, it's a gorgeous product and it's a gorgeous product that's easy to use."

Well, we need to govern that, right? We need to put a little bit of organization here. So that's what we did.

If I'm running our report, right now in 30 minutes, and my boss tells me that I need a report for sales in Africa, for example, and I have 30 minutes. I know exactly where to go, and which data source to search. And if I don't know, I'll go to Server, and I'll search my tags in my data sources in my Server. I'll get the data source, and build a report in 10 minutes. And it's so fast. And I can really make it fancy. Just three visualizations and that's, boom, that's the answer."

Seattle Children\u2019s is dedicated to the treatment and elimination of pediatric diseases. With Tableau, the supply chain team can track product inventory and delivery information. With more insight into their data they have drastically reduced overstocked inventory and expired product. Clinical staff are encouraged by the new methodology, and can fully focus on patient care\u2014with confidence that items will be there when needed. The supply chain team at Seattle Children\u2019s was working on a problem: Their old inventory management processes left too much room for human error. They were relying on expensive Omnicell supply cabinets to manage stock. But requiring caregivers to check out stock via the Omnicell cabinets wasn\u2019t working. The logistics team still dealt with 2,000 out-of-stock alerts a month and Purchasing created 20,000 rush orders per year to fill urgent stock deficits. When providers needed an item that wasn\u2019t already in the ERP system, the process to create a \u2018special\u2019 took over an hour. The Sourcing team would have to validate the item, source, and cost\u2014taking approximately 88 minutes per special line. When stock arrived, the challenges weren\u2019t over. Employees often loaded new stock at the front of a shelf, leaving older stock to expire on the back of the shelf. This was wasteful and potentially risky. Manual inventory checks happened regularly, but were far from foolproof. \u201cNobody is going to count every single bin and every single item every single time they go through, so they estimate,\u201d said Jason Klein, Supply Chain Specialist at Seattle Children\u2019s. \u201cOne person would look at a bin and say it had a certain amount of stock. And then the next person would come along and say, \u2018oh, that bin looks full. \u201d As a result, caregivers lost confidence and began stashing supplies\u2014exacerbating the problems. The team implemented a new system based on the \u2018demand flow\u2019 supply chain methodology. Demand flow consists of a two-bin system\u2014one bin placed behind the other\u2014for every SKU. Each set of bins is labeled with a bar code that pinpoints its specific location, down to the shelf. When a supply bin is empty, it is removed from the shelf, and the full bin behind it is pulled forward. Empty bins are collected, scanned, and refilled at night. Employees then restock bins into the rear position on the shelf\u2014ensuring that older product gets used first. With the new demand flow system, approximately 1,000 bins are scanned per day. This new methodology required the team to rely on reporting to track product usage and plan for future orders. At first, the team queried their Lawson ERP system, but it was difficult to see the big picture. Jason says, \u201cThe only thing we had to begin with were these very stale, very monolithic reports from our ERP system. You would have to download five different spreadsheets, combine them all together to get something usable, and then combine that additional information to get to the point of how fast things were turning and where you should be doing your focus work.\u201d And if they wanted to create or update a report they would have to submit a ticket with the Information Systems (IS) department. Requests to update a standard report\u2014such as comparing inventory at the main campus with that of the Bellevue clinic\u2014went to the back of the reporting queue for the entire hospital. In addition to reporting, auditing product was difficult and required hours of manual logging the data in the ERP system. \u201cThere was no good way to actually look at every single product in every single location to check to see if the item had an expiration date, and then to go through every single product to make sure that none of it was expired,\u201d Jason explains. The team realized that they needed more efficient reporting\u2014which meant a better tool. The Enterprise Analytics team at Seattle Children\u2019s were the first ones to introduce Jason to Tableau. He decided to test the software using the report that compared the two Seattle Children\u2019s campuses. Jason was able to easily query their IBM Netezza data mart and pull the data into Tableau. Jason says, \u201cWithin 45 minutes of originally opening up Tableau I was able to e-mail that back to our Enterprise Analytics person and they were able to upload the new report. It really helped us figure out how our main campus was doing compared to our clinic.\u201d Although Jason first learned Tableau on his own, after a few months, he decided to attend an in-person beginner and advanced classroom training. He continues to learn more about Tableau with online training videos. Today at Seattle Children\u2019s, up to 70 people create visualizations in Tableau Desktop and approximately 2,000-2,500 people interact with them on Tableau Server. Jason quickly realized that Tableau would be the right match for the demand flow methodology based on his ability to quickly discover insights about the two Seattle Children\u2019s campuses. Using data from past orders, they can plan to have the right amount of product for the busiest months of the year. \u201cWe go through and scan and that information gets put into our data mart and then it shows up on our reports. We\u2019re able to see that a bin is stocked out, and whether or not both bins came down on the same day. If they are both stocked out, that is an indicator that we definitely should look into increasing stock, or look at why it stocked out,\u201d he says. The team has also created automatic auditing views in Tableau, allowing them to keep track of product locations within the warehouse. They can also audit product deliveries, determining when product was scanned and which deliveries were arriving that day. \u201cOur supervisors use a Tableau report that shows what was delivered that same day. They can easily go out and check bin locations to see if product was delivered correctly.\u201d To avoid \u2018specials,\u2019 the supply chain team created an item master dashboard in Tableau. Staff can now quickly search for an item to determine if it already exists in the system\u2014saving the Sourcing department and clinical partners time and resources. In Tableau, they can easily track at-risk product before it expires. Jason comments, \u201cIf we've seen two bins in the last 180 days, we know that particular location has been rotated well\u2014so we know that it isn\u2019t expired.\u201d Managing SKUs is now easier and more efficient. In a post published on the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) blog, Jason says, \u201cOur ability to manage our stock keeping units (SKUs) has improved by 200% - from 2,000 before we adopted self-service analytics and visualization, to 6,000 currently. And most importantly, we save more than 40,000 clinical hours each year.\u201d Clinicians also benefit from the new demand flow system. In the HFMA blog, Jason Klein shares how clinicians use a medical equipment visualization, built in Tableau, to track equipment. With less time locating resources, clinicians can focus on quality patient care. When Jason talks about the new system, he mentions a note that he received from one of the nurses at Seattle Children\u2019s. She writes, \u201cWe LOVE demand flow!! Thank you for all your hard work in getting this to the ANI Clinic!\u201d"

        "content": "Just Eat is a leader in food delivery, partnering with over 20,000 restaurants across 13 countries. In just 18 months, Just Eat implemented Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server on a global scale. The business intelligence team publishes data sources to Server, ensuring a single source of truth. The operations team can now identify opportunities for improvement and help restaurant partners grow their businesses. And with Tableau Server, restaurants can log in to see their own customer and sales data, and dig deeper with web authoring. With Tableau, Just Eat has enhanced their relationships with customers\u2014both restaurants and end users. Business Intelligence Manager, Toan Hoang states, \u201cIt means [restaurants] will have a great experience, they will be able to grow and we will grow with them.\u201d Tableau: How is Tableau working for you at Just Eat? Toan Hoang, Business Intelligence Manager: The biggest benefit of Tableau at Just Eat is we have enabled our users to love data. Before, loving data was hard. You'll be drowned in a mountain of data\u2014spreadsheets, emails, different systems. What Tableau has done has enabled our users to interrogate that data in a very easy and friendly way. Tableau: How are you using Tableau? Toan: In Just Eat, we use Tableau globally as our single business intelligence tool. We use it from executive level where they see the dashboards all the way down to operations; people that work day to day with our clients. Tableau: What does Just Eat do? Toan: Restaurants are the heartbeat of what we do. We're providing restaurants all around the world a front page and potential customers. What Tableau does, it allows us to aggregate our data, identify our key metrics, and present them to the people who work day in and day out with restaurants. Tableau: What did you use before Tableau? Toan: Prior to Tableau, we had Microsoft Excel. Everyone had their spreadsheets, but then we realized as we grew as an organization, we need a more consistent form of information delivery, a single version of the truth. Tableau: How does Tableau help you find that \u201csingle version of the truth?\u201d Toan: With Tableau, we publish our data sources, which act as our golden source of truth. And even building dashboards from them can see the same information. It's secure, it's partitioned so you can only access what you need to access. Tableau: Do your customers get to see the data as well? Toan: We have provided several of our restaurants access to our data. So they can log in through our secure Web portal, access their own information, interact with that information, interact with dashboards that we have built purposefully for them. Or actually create own queries and use Web authoring to gain insight into their own business. Tableau: Do you only provide historical insights with your data? Toan: We can actually present them information. We're not just signing up restaurants, we are presenting them a map of where they can be, where they can grow to. And our sales teams value that. Tableau: How does this impact the restaurants that use Just Eat? Toan: If a restaurant has bad orders, our consultants, our customer care centers will work with restaurants and help them achieve a better result. And it means that they will have a great experience, they will be able to grow and we will grow with them. Tableau: How do you secure your Tableau data for your clients? Toan: We have a single-sign-on mechanism and federation. We essentially have a site per restaurant which enables us to secure the information so that no one else can access it. No accident can ever expose this sensitive information to anyone else. And then we give end users access to that. Tableau: How has Tableau changed your business? Toan: We can run projects now which are data dependent that will drive serious growth in different areas. This is not just at Just Eat, but throughout my career, business intelligence is a valuable asset, and Tableau makes it easy. Tableau: What is the future of Tableau at Just Eat? Toan: Tableau has started to impact major decisions. And I believe as we grow, as user adoption increases, Tableau will be an ever-increasing source of information to drive decisions."

        "content": "Jet2 is British, leisure airline that also provides convenient, affordable holiday packages. An initial project with Tableau was analyzing Jet2\u2019s partnerships with hotels to ensure that they were serving customers\u2019 needs. When Tableau expanded to the revenue team, they had a \u201ceureka moment\u201d because they could visualize data that was previously difficult to access. Today with help from Tableau, departments at Jet2 use data to collaborate more effectively and work together to develop solutions. As Andrew Aucott, General Manager of Business Intelligence comments, Tableau will continue to \u201cchange the way [they] work.\u201d Tableau: How do you use data at Jet2? Andrew Aucott, General Manager of Business Intelligence: We are, fundamentally, a leisure travel business. We use data for everything from finance to revenue management to customer operations. It underpins everything that we do in the organization. Tableau: How does Tableau fit in? Andrew: One of the initial projects that we have set up with Tableau is to analyze how we contract against hotels at certain destinations that we fly to. By using Tableau, we've been able to see the contracts that we currently have that we would have previously not been able to see and see how they're related to our customer needs\u2014and hopefully improve what the customer wants. So it gives us the ability to be able to see where we are doing well, where we've done a good job of this year, and it lets us see into the future what we would contract. Tableau: What problems were you facing before Tableau? Andrew: I think one of the problems that we had before\u2014 one of the reasons that we looked at Tableau is because we were, effectively, serving data mostly through Excel pivot tables. The way that we used to work with Excel and the limitations around that, the business would come to us with a set of requirements. And it just wasn't efficient because we'd be building something that actually didn't turn out to be what they wanted when they saw it. Tableau: Have you seen more collaboration since implementing Tableau? Andrew: I think some of the best ways to inspire people is to actually show them the product. So I frequently hold sessions around Tableau and how we can use it, show examples of our data to get people engaged with it and show them the power of what it can do. Tableau gives us the ability to work together on the solution and then collaborate more effectively as we're building it, and that will, ultimately, give them what they need in the end. Tableau: How have you improved data visibility since introducing Tableau? Andrew: I think in terms of productivity enhancements, in terms of the speed to insight, in terms of actually taking a set of data around a particular problem\u2014putting that together and showing that in Tableau was something that we haven't been able to do in the past. We've been able to analyze that data, and that certainly told us things that we previously have not seen. That's been a massive improvement to the way that we work, and it will make a huge difference to the way we work going forward. I think it will change the way we work and it will enable us to collaborate much, much better in the future. I think it will change the way that we do analysis within the company. Tableau: What other departments use Tableau at Jet2? What was their reaction to the software? Andrew: There was one particular meeting that I remember where the revenue team saw the two and there was a bit of a Eureka moment, really, when they saw it. And that led to them really wanting to learn more about the product. Tableau: What other benefits have you experienced? Andrew: We were giving people access to data, essentially. And it was pretty uncontrolled. So what Tableau really gives us is the ability to have some control over the consistency and how that information is used. And I think that flexibility resonated with the revenue teams and they appreciated the benefits of working in that way."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "BJC HealthCare's focus is to provide excellent healthcare services to residents in parts of Illinois and Missouri. In response to a changing healthcare landscape, BJC started a multi-year initiative to reduce supply expenses from 23.5 percent of net revenue to 19 percent. In video 1, Lynn Kersting, Strategic Manager, Supply Chain, discusses how the analytics team pulls data from their Microsoft SQL Server data mart to visualize in Tableau. BJC leverages sites within Tableau Server to securely share data with different parts of the organization\u2014increasing transparency and reducing cost. In video 2, Lynn discusses Tableau engagement at BJC. With help from Tableau consultants on site, BJC encouraged internal training across the organization for both Server and Desktop users. BJC has also created their own internal user group to encourage collaboration. Lynn says that \u201cjust being able to put the story out there\u201d has led to many \u201cah-hah\u201d moments for BJC. Tableau: What prompted your need for Tableau? Lynn Kersting, Strategic Manager, Supply Chain: The changes in the healthcare reform that we're anticipating starting in 2011 really drove what the organization started to look at supply expense as cost reduction. Our goal in a multi-year initiative was to reduce our supply expense as a percent of net revenue from 23.5 percent down to 19 percent. And we still wanted to increase our patient outcomes, improve our patient outcomes, and increase our patient satisfaction. We have to do all of this while reducing our cost. So we had a whole analytics team that was added. By doing so, we were able to bring in data. The data that we had prior to that was there, but it was not easy to get it and it wasn't friendly to work with. So our data team, our data developers, working in our supply chain data mart in SQL Server brought all that data together after months and months of working with our ERP system and having all the data feed to us, brought all that data to us, and then Tableau Server is our method of deploying that data to the rest of the organization and having transparency. Tableau: What is the impact of increasing transparency across the organization? Lynn: We have definitely driven to a more data-driven decision culture within BJC. And what's wonderful about it was our leadership really saw the importance not only of having the data, but also having our engagement team, which is the team that I lead. And that was about getting that out to the customers, getting it out into the organization. It allowed for us to have a wider depth and breadth of all the analysts that could do the work, more than what we could accomplish. Tableau: Can you share how you use Tableau sites to share data across the organization? Lynn: We, in the engagement part of supply chain analytics, we reach out to our entire organization. If they wanted access to the sites, we gave them a site. It was self-managed by them and self-maintained. That opened up our user base. The growth started at the hospitals, and within the hospitals and slowly spread throughout the rest of the organization. And it's just been a wonderful experience finally to see the networking across the hospitals and the system has been amazing. Tableau: How have you increased engagement with Tableau across your organization? Lynn: BJC really saw it was important as far as the engagement aspect of supply chain analytics to really be able to engage with all the customers and users of Tableau within our organization. Part of that was creating internal training. And that's been really exciting. We are actually very fortunate to work with two Tableau consultants that have been on our team\u2014virtually two to three consultants\u2014every year for the last couple years. Tableau: What kind of training opportunities do you offer? Lynn: Currently, we have four different training classes available. We have one that's just Tableau Server viewer, for those individuals who don't have the Desktop license and are just viewing online. And we have a basics, intermediate, and an advanced class. In the past year of having all of our training, 325 employees have taken at least one of those courses. And in the past year, we've taught at least 70 classes. So it's not just about supply expense. We're really leading that charge within BJC Healthcare of fostering that user base. We do that through our training. We do it through our internal user group. We have five sessions a year, probably have 50 to 70 employees who show up every time. Tableau: What has been the most exciting part for you throughout this experience? Lynn: But what's been really wonderful for me, this has been my best job I've ever had. This is what I do. And to be able to bring that to our users within the system, to be able to provide those training classes and teach them and see those \"ah-hah\" moments for them during training\u2014just collaborating with them and partnering with them. Tableau: How has Tableau streamlined your data analysis? Lynn: So many hours in my past that I've spent taking a CSV file or a text file or multiple tabs in an Excel document or Access and just trying to get the data in a format to use, with Tableau is just such a time saver. The best parts about using Tableau is being able to see what's happening so quickly, just drag-and-drop capabilities, different graphs that you could use, different vizzes, just being able to put the story out there in front of someone that they can see it. If you put it in front of them and they don't understand or don't see it, then it's not the right viz. There's another viz that's going to give you that answer. Tableau: What has been the biggest \u201cah-hah\u201d moment for you so far? Lynn: I would say the biggest \"ah-hah\" moment I've had since using Tableau, since 2009, was that ability to bring what would have been probably five or six different reports that I would have ran separately to try to drill in and find an answer if I got that far. Pulling all of the information at one time and just being able to selectively drill into, change dimensions, find that answer and sometimes even though you can't prove it previously, that maybe that answer was A. You couldn't answer it, you couldn't prove it just by pulling that data. That, all of a sudden, by having Tableau, you're able to say, \u201coh, my gosh, here it is.\u201d This really is exactly what we were saying, \u201cthe proof is right here, you can see it, look.\u201d That's been awesome. That's probably the biggest \"ah-hah\" moment. And that was from the beginning."

        "content": "Boston Scientific develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices around the world. Their mission is to create innovative medical solutions that transform lives. In video 1, Rory Abbazio, Senior Manager, Business Intelligence, discusses how IT partners with the business to assess sales patterns and track market opportunities. To successfully integrate Tableau, they \u201cstarted small and thought big\u201d with a slow rollout\u2014 choosing to train key analysts and nest them within each business division. In video 2, Rory describes how they use a live connection to SAP HANA to analyze data in Tableau. With a fast connection, business users and executives can make smart decisions on the fly. Tableau: Have you seen more collaboration between Business and IT since adopting Tableau? Rory Abazzio, Senior Manager, Business Intelligence: I think what really speaks to Boston Scientific and why we're really so successful with the tool is the fact that IT got ahead of the curve instead of the business coming to us. We went to the business and said, \"Hey, these are the top tools in the industry, this is how it can fit your use cases, let's pilot out, let's proof it out with some of your use cases.\" And together, collectively, we were in lock step in our decision-making process moving forward with Tableau. So they were really excited to bring the tool in and really excited to partner with IT overall. We really wanted to empower our business partners at the end of the day. And that's what we're really seeing. Tableau: What was the key for successful implementation of Tableau? Rory: We took an agile approach instead of a waterfall approach and started to add on the functionality instead of one big bang. Instead of doing a big waterfall approach, we started small and really thought big. We sent people to the fundamentals and the advanced training, at least the core members of the team and some of the people in the business that were really going to be content creators. And what we did, how we structured the team, was there's analysts that are within IT that also partner each division. So they know the division, they know what they're trying to get to, what data problems they're trying to solve. They also know Tableau really well. So they're nested in with the business. And what we do is we started them small saying, \u201cokay, this is how you do grouping, this is how you do hierarchies, this is how you do calculations.\u201d Tableau: How do Business and IT benefit each other? Rory: We had our work cut out for us as far as IT really establishing themselves and really showing that we can truly be partners and not just shove a technology down their throat. We wanted to say, \u201cokay, how can we embrace this together and how can we make sure that we're set up for an enterprise perspective to make sure you guys are successful within the divisions?\u201d IT's really helped set us up for success. Now we feel really enabled and empowered to really use Tableau to maximize what we want to do with our own data at this point. Tableau: What are some next steps? Rory: Now we're starting to get into the other divisions. And like I said, we've barely just scratched the surface of getting to other adjacencies. So the tool itself has been really pervasive throughout the organization in the sense that one person has it and they start to create these great visualizations or these great workbooks. Learn more about why IT loves Tableau. Tableau: What were your needs before and how has Tableau met them? Rory: I have three centers of excellences under me. One is for BI reporting, the other is for operation reporting, and the last one is pricing. We're moving forward with Tableau because we saw that a lot of the use cases were missing when we had Business Objects and PowerPlay. Tableau: What do you get with Tableau that you didn\u2019t have with Business Objects? Rory: That ad-hoc analysis was one of the key gaps that were missing. The dashboarding ability is one of the huge things that Tableau brings to the table, especially around visualizations, and being able to easily find the patterns in data. Tableau: How are you connecting to data in Tableau? Rory: We're leveraging SAP HANA as our main database for Tableau. As compared to what most companies are doing with extracts, we're actually using a live connection. And what's really benefiting us is really the performance that we're seeing. So both OUS and in the U.S we're seeing phenomenal performance both with Server and Desktop. We're a Salesforce company. And then also maximizing all the work we do with HANA along the way, optimizing our HANA views and then creating new HANA views on the back end. And that's really kind of a long story short of our rollout success. Tableau: How do users interact with data? Rory: We wanted to be able to provide a service where business users can act\u2014make decisions off the data that they have in front of them. We're really driving a culture of analytics. What we're seeing is that instead of leveraging Excel reports or bringing those up or using PowerPoint, people were starting to use stories for their quarterly business reviews, and that's been really impactful because, a VP would ask a question, they're able to really dive into the answer right there in there. So it's a really intuitive, really easy-to-use experience, especially in presentations. Tableau: How many people are already using Tableau within your company? Rory: So we have 245 Desktop users at this point, and around 1500 Server users. And that's literally just getting started because we just started\u2014we've only had Tableau for about four months. So we completed one division, that being peripheral interventions."

Their mission is to report on relevant business, financial, political and cultural interests\u2014and display the information in a simple, meaningful way. Today, Il Sole 24 Ore uses Tableau Public to set themselves apart from their competitors. With Tableau, they can quickly identify relationships between data points and display them on their website. Interactive visuals empower readers to engage with the data for themselves. Since they incorporated vizzes into articles, they have attracted more users to their site and have seen an impressive rise in return visitors. When Content Manager, Andrea Gianotti talks about Tableau\u2019s versatility, he says, \u201cin short, it\u2019s essential to have [Tableau].\u201d Tableau: Why did you start working with Tableau? Andrea Gianotti, Content Manager: The reason I started working with Tableau is because I needed a tool that was flexible, versatile, simple and didn't require any particular skills; because the various skills were already included in the product, in the tool. Tableau: How is your company using Tableau Public? Andrea: In particular, we use Tableau for data analysis and for online publication on a blog of interactive info graphics that you can watch and interact with. In short, we make it more fun, because the user can have access to data that would be boring or uninteresting if described or represented as a simple table. Tableau: How has this impacted your company? Andrea: The main thing is that Tableau is a tool that has allowed us to identify relationships between data quickly and easily, and to display them. This means we are able to communicate better, and being a company that deals with media, for us communication is of course essential. Communication of data has been improved, in fact, and this has only been made possible thanks to such a tool. Tableau: What aspects of Tableau Public resonate the most with your company\u2019s needs? Andrea: In my opinion, the greatest strengths of Tableau are: the \"wow\" effect\u2014when I present an interactive dashboard to my customers they are impressed because they have a chance to play around with it, they have an opportunity to interact with it and they have a chance to be leaders themselves when they have to work on the data. This is obviously a huge added value. The other point of interest is that in our work, we need to represent relationships visually. We have a chance to observe directly in graphics what we can only guess at by maybe looking at data flows or tables\u2014we can put different kinds of data together very easily, and this is a very important factor. You don't need to have advanced graphics skills to produce products that are beautiful and pleasing, and you don't need to have advanced statistical and computer skills in order to represent your data effectively. Tableau: Have you noticed a change in user interest since incorporating vizzes? Andrea: Readers showed interest right away, because it was something new, it was something that made the difference for them between static information, such as that which our competitors might provide, and ours, represented in a dynamic, articulated way, which is one step ahead. We have noticed that an interactive dashboard attracts users to our site more often, and most of all they keep coming back much more often. In this way we have more satisfied users, who keep visiting our site and trust us, dedicating much more time to interacting with the data. The fact that we can easily and precisely publish a very large series of objects and make them available to our readers has certainly made the information that we publish more appealing, and it has certainly been a tool that has made our relationship with the reader a lot easier. Tableau: Do you have any recommendations for someone looking into Tableau Public? Andrea: Tableau is a very, very versatile tool, it allows me to manage very large amounts of data that are very different from each other easily and it is the perfect meeting point between Excel and graphic tools. It has the potential of one but also the other and anyone who does analysis really ought to have it on their PC. In short, it's essential to have it in my opinion."

        "company": "Dwolla",
        "content": "Dwolla is a fast-growing company providing online payment solutions for businesses of all sizes and powering billions of dollars in commerce annually. Their mission is to move money quickly while keeping costs low. With Tableau and Amazon Web Services (AWS), Dwolla created a flexible, scalable infrastructure for its growing business. With Tableau, Dwolla streamlined analytics, reducing reporting time by weeks and saving valuable engineering resources. Today, users across the company can analyze customer demographics and detect fraud with Tableau maps\u2014helping protect members and keeping costs low. Dwolla is a small company with big ambitions. When adopting technology, they need speed, scalability, and compatibility to rapidly accelerate growth. With growing business demands came growing data and as a result, Dwolla engineers needed to scale the company\u2019s data infrastructure. Dwolla leveraged Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store, process, and access data at scale. Less than a year later, Dwolla adopted Tableau to uncover insights within this big data. A big factor in Dwolla\u2019s decision to adopt Tableau and AWS was cost of ownership. Fred Galoso, Software Developer at Dwolla explains, \u201cTotal cost of ownership was one of the main reasons we moved to AWS, and in conjunction, Tableau. With AWS, we're able to store data and also process that data at scale for a fraction of the cost of some other commercial providers that are out there. Tableau is a natural fit and saves us a lot of time, effort and engineering resources to be able to create those insights.\u201d Fred shares how the combination of Tableau and AWS allows for speed, scalability, and flexibility as Dwolla grows. And with Tableau, the Dwolla team can natively connect to a variety of data sources including Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. \u201cAWS provides us the speed in terms of our infrastructure and from an organizational standpoint, the flexibility to change. With Tableau we also get that speed. It's really performant but also really flexible and really easy to adapt to anything that we need to change.\u201d \u201cI think the combination of the two is really exciting, AWS and Tableau. Essentially, I am going to be able to answer the questions I was today, even when Dwolla is ten times bigger, a thousand times bigger, however many times bigger it is [in the future].\u201d Before Tableau, analysis was increasingly time intensive for the IT and engineering teams. Fred recalls, \u201cCreating new reports or dashboards, if we wanted any sort of flexibility, required a lot of developer or engineering resources.\u201d With Tableau, Dwolla has streamlined this process. Fred concludes, \u201cTableau has essentially allowed us to go from days to even weeks to author a dashboard into hours and to days. Instead of static spreadsheets, the team uses interactive Tableau dashboards to uncover insights at a glance\u2014saving valuable engineering resources and encouraging innovation. \u201cWe\u2019re able to essentially plot everything and look at clusters and colors and trend lines over time. Being able to see those trends in Tableau from a glance is a lot easier than looking at a spreadsheet.\u201d Today, Dwolla employees can tap into a multitude of data sources. In less than a year, Tableau has spread across Dwolla teams, with employees creating hundreds of Tableau workbooks. Instead of creating reports in silos, Dwolla teams now collaborate on analyses. \u201cWith Tableau I often run into cases where I thought I had an idea of how I wanted to visualize something and then I'll just be sitting side-by-side with say someone from marketing and we\u2019re working together to try different combinations\u201d says Fred. \u201cReally, what we're hearing from our colleagues is, \u201cwe want more Tableau.\u201d\u201d Since Dwolla\u2019s founding, the company has evolved to meet the needs of its customers. With Tableau, the Dwolla team can conduct market research and understand \u201cwho\u2019s using Dwolla, why they are using it, and what Dwolla products they are using to be successful.\u201d \u201cWe're looking at any sort of data that we need to power our payments network. So that could be customer demographics, looking at our products and managing our products, or things like fraud and compliance,\u201d shares Fred. \u201cIt's a big part of making sure we're protecting our members and keeping the cost of moving money in the Dwolla network as low as possible.\u201d For example, a fraud analyst may look at registration data to analyze new accounts. With Tableau, they can plot hot spots for high-intensity financial crime areas to quickly identify trends instead of manually analyzing this data in spreadsheet\u2014enabling proactive fraud prevention. \u201cThey're able to understand and be at the forefront of those trends,\u201d says Fred. \u201cFrom a visual standpoint, they're able to just pan and zoom and see all the different types and zones that there are in a map without having to just pull down a data sheet.\u201d"

Gathering, understanding, and applying insights from sales data is as paramount to the success of pharmaceutical retailers as it is to any other retail sector. \u201cOur mission is to provide a service which places our customers\u2019 business data in their own hands,\u201d said Yoann Leny, National Business Intelligence Manager at Intellipharm. \u201cOver 4,000 stores in Australia currently access and contribute to our platform.\u201d Using Tableau Server, Intellipharm embeds dashboards into their suite of web-based business intelligence products. After adopting Tableau, Intellipharm\u2019s software had fully functional dashboards within two weeks. Intellipharm employees also use Tableau Desktop and Server to build and share visualiations. With Tableau, Leny comments, \u201cWe\u2019re able to invest more time in growing the business and better servicing our existing client portfolio.\u201d Intellipharm\u2019s pharmacy customers capture large amounts of data, on everything from minute operative details to product sales, revenue, stock levels, periodic updates on turnover and more. This information comes flooding into Intellipharm\u2019s database on a daily basis. Needless to say, packaging it up in a user friendly format was a real challenge. \u201cWe work with over two million rows of data every single day. The sheer magnitude can be overwhelming if not dealt with efficiently,\u201d said Leny. \u201cWe always strive to present customers with their information as soon as possible, so they can immediately implement the insights from their sales data, however, it was taking two to three weeks to create customised dashboards. In the fast-paced world of sales, data can become completely redundant within three weeks.\u201d The company was using web technologies to interact with the huge quantity of data, which proved incredibly time consuming. As Intellipharm continued to grow, it was simply not feasible for the business and its customers, who rely on the business intelligence provider for real-time information, to continue with the web technologies. \u201cIn pharmaceuticals, a hay fever medicine becomes obsolete when the pollen settles. Seasons and trends can change in a matter of days. The last thing we wanted to do was present stale information to our customers,\u201d Leny said. Web technologies like PHP were also difficult to drill down. In fact, Leny was the only team member able to interact with Intellipharm\u2019s data using the unfriendly web technology system. Data reaches Intellipharm\u2019s database from thousands of sources in various formats. From there, the web technology system was slow in converting the data into one efficient flow of information, delaying the speed to action for customers. \u201cWe were meeting barriers throughout the process which meant our customers had to wait longer for insights. We recognised this delay and even created a new business unit to speed up our response time,\u201d Leny said. Despite this change, Leny was still pressed for time, sieving though two billion rows of information to present blended data insights. \u201cWe could typically present a report to our customers on one data set \u2013 their revenue or stock for example \u2013 but not how each set affected the others,\u201d said Leny. \u201cWe were looking to create reports that showed customers how every facet of their data could reveal an entire business story. We wanted to give them that \u2018ah-ha!\u2019 moment when they realise the cause and effect of business operations.\u201d Intellipharm needed a system that allowed its team to pull a customised report encompassing multiple data sets so customers could view the entirety of their data. Web technologies simply weren\u2019t allowing data sets to speak to one another. \u201cWe were sure there was a goldmine hidden within the static database system just waiting to be analysed,\u201d said Leny. Having partnered with Tableau in a prior role in France, Leny knew where to turn for a trusted business intelligence solution. \u201cFairly quickly we made the decision to employ Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server to embed different dashboards into a web-based solution,\u201d he said. In two weeks the software was fully implemented and functional, with Intellipharm customers consuming their own data through Tableau-powered dashboards. Thanks to Leny\u2019s past experience the team required minimal training and quickly integrated Tableau into Intellipharm\u2019s client-facing operations. \u201cThey may not fully realise it, but our customers are truly reaping the benefits. Tableau actually comprises the backbone of the detailed and visually appealing displays our customers rely on,\u201d Leny said. Thanks to Tableau\u2019s user-friendly interface, Leny is no longer the only team member gathering and visualising data. \u201cI was the only person using Tableau at Intellipharm originally but my colleagues\u2019 soon developed an interest in it. Now a third of the staff are able to benefit from using the software,\u201d he said. The journey continued as Intellipharm moved to Tableau Server. Within 12 short months, 10 of the 30 Intellipharm staff members were able to leverage the data on the Tableau Server. They were able to build their own visualisations and ask their own questions of the data, rather than looking to Leny for clarification. Using the copious amounts of data accessible to them, the team was able to create a central platform as well as a self-service program with multiple models. \u201cWhether our customers want to analyse the marketing space or see their sales, we now have models to suit each individual need. We have between 30 and 40 models which allow our customers to analyse and understand their businesses,\u201d said Leny. Customers have been surprised at the insights this new method of analysing data has yielded. Data sets can now speak with other sets to form new understandings, giving businesses a valued birds-eye view. \u201cAll our customers were amazed at the insights they could gather on their sales transactions, with the dashboard spanning information on date and time in relation to sales quantity or profit. Interestingly enough, we learnt there\u2019s a peak in cosmetics sales on Friday afternoon!\u201d laughed Leny. With Tableau underpinning insights, Intellipharm can analyse and present data while it is still relevant, enabling pharmacies to carry out timely actions to improve performance. For example, if an item is not selling well in a store it can be relocated or remarketed. \u201cIn the past we were spending up to three weeks creating one dashboard. We can now have that same dashboard created in two to three days and delivered in an easy to understand visualisation,\u201d said Leny. Efficiency is the first noticeable improvement \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t stop there. Gaining more time since using Tableau, Leny now celebrates the hours he is able to commit to other areas. \u201cThe time saving is the most obvious improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re able to invest more time in growing the business and better servicing our existing client portfolio.\u201d Intellipharm customers are also enjoying the improved efficiency, accessing data immediately to compete in a more agile way. \u201cAfter just one day of training on how to get the most out of their dashboards, customers realise how easy they are to use and see their data in a new light,\u201d said Leny. \u201cWe create the dashboards which drive our customers\u2019 businesses forward. They consume the visualisations on the fly, on tablets and mobile devices. They know where to click and how to navigate the program and have been overwhelmed with the unexpected insights they\u2019ve uncovered.\" \u201cI can be with in a meeting with a client and review dashboards on a tablet. Sometimes, if a client needs a change then and there in the meeting, I get out my iPhone and we make the change together straight away. Now that data sets can speak to one another, we\u2019ve made it easy for customers to think well outside the box.\u201d Leny envisions an exciting partnership ahead. He hopes to expand the Tableau relationship to offer the interface at a store level, so each pharmacist can not only consume dashboards but also create them. \u201cNow that we have Tableau, we couldn\u2019t imagine a future without it.\u201d"

        "content": "Diploma courses, Business Intelligence & Analytics and Business Informatics\u2014offered under Nanyang Polytechnic\u2019s School of Information Technology\u2014focus on providing students with data analytics skills that are required in today\u2019s workplace. Dr. Koh Noi Sian, Lecturer at the School of Information Technology at Nanyang Polytechnic, decided to use Tableau in her classroom to teach students how to gather insights from data. Because of its easy-to-use interface, students spend less time learning the tool, and more time getting hands-on data analytics experience. The School of Information Technology introduced Tableau into Nanyang Polytechnic\u2019s curriculum in 2011, when the Diploma of Business Intelligence & Analytics (DBA) was launched. When the DBA team researched self-service data analytics tools, they found that a lot of tools required a fair amount of coding. Students would have to spend more time learning the tool, leaving less time to actually work with the data. They came across Tableau and found that it was easy to use, with the analytical depth that was necessary for the curriculum. \u201cIt used to take a few weeks for students to create one dashboard,\u201d said Dr. Koh. \u201cThey had to learn to use these complex, traditional visual analytics tools and this required quite a bit of scripting skills. We wanted to avoid this and allow the students to have more time to explore and work with data,\u201d she explained. When Dr. Koh adopted Tableau into her curriculum, she spent an hour demonstrating Tableau to her students. After the quick training, students continue to pick-up Tableau within the first lesson, and usually create dashboards almost immediately. Currently, the analytics related modules and workshops see enrollment of up to 400 students per year. Tableau is taught in the Data Visualization module, which students take in the second year of the DBA course. They learn the key skills necessary for creating an effective dashboard. In the process, they are required to gather data from official sources like government websites, and use Tableau to analyze the data and gain insights into current topics such as housing and healthcare trends in Singapore. Students in the final year of the course use Tableau to work on real-life industry projects during their internship and they have to present to business executives and professionals at their internship company. Many of these industry partner organizations are highly impressed with the students\u2019 presentations. Some have even adopted the use of Tableau in their own work. \u201cSome of the more creative students are able to create very impressive charts and diagrams that are both visually appealing and informative,\u201d said Dr. Koh with pride. \u201cThe students love Tableau. When they are given a dataset, the first tool they turn to is Tableau. They also use Tableau when they come across any data work at their internship,\u201d she added. Dr. Koh has since helped introduce Tableau into various curriculums at her school. There are now five modules within the Business Intelligence and Analytics diploma course that includes Tableau in their course work. \u201cI just conducted a Tableau training session for 50 colleagues from my school, and my colleagues found Tableau to be very easy to use,\u201d commented Dr. Koh. Additionally, Nanyang offers evening classes in business and big data for working adults and holiday courses for secondary school students. The school has incorporated Tableau into these classes with great success, according to Dr. Koh. Dr. Koh\u2019s colleagues from other schools within Nanyang Polytechnic have also approached her for advice on introducing Tableau into their curriculum. She is planning to conduct an institution-wide training session to help lecturers from the other schools get familiarized with the software. Dr. Koh said, \u201cData analytics is increasingly becoming an important skillset in the workplace. The first batch of students who were taught Tableau in their coursework here have told us that working with Tableau is one of the most important skills they have learnt as they have been able to apply the skill to their work in the industry, and also in university projects for those who went on to university.\u201d Finally, she shared that Tableau has moved beyond a teaching tool at Nanyang. Many of her colleagues have also started to use Tableau to track students\u2019 performance, enrollment numbers, and even student stress levels by analyzing data from wearable fitness devices."

        "company": "MapCase",
        "content": "Through the MapCase suite of apps, skiers, hikers, and cyclists give feedback on the spot. This data is supplemented by social media, hotel ratings, targeted survey, and other touch points. The data is relevant to both the tourism industry and sport product brands, opening up a direct channel to customers and allowing them to immediately react to current trends. Using Tableau Server, MapCase embeds powerful dashboards into their products\u2014and the demand for their solution is growing within the industry. Knowing the preferences, usage behavior, and satisfaction of their respective target audiences enables tourism companies to optimize their activities in entirely new ways. Thanks to Tableau, MapCase is confident that they will become one of the major players in this market going forward. Mapcase develops mobile apps MAPtoSNOW, MAPtoHIKE and MAPtoBIKE. The apps continuously record GPS data and allow their users\u2014winter sport enthusiasts, hikers and cyclists\u2014to keep track of their own achievements and compare them with others. To drive customer engagement and app usage, MapCase offers a variety of additional functions, such as prizes for certain achievements, virtual competitions, scavenger hunts and leaderboards. According to Bastian Kneissl, co-founder and CEO of MapCase, more than 200,000 sports enthusiasts worldwide actively use the MapCase apps. They open a dialog with the user, asking a variety of questions regarding satisfaction with the touristic offers or recommendations for other users worldwide. All of this information \u2014 combined with positional data \u2014 is collected on the MapCase servers in virtually real time. \u201cThanks to our apps, we had built a very valuable channel for interaction and started to actively encourage our users to give feedback about their satisfaction with the provided services,\u201d says Bastian Kneissl. \u201cWe knew which routes and ski slopes were particularly popular and which ones weren\u2019t. We knew what age and gender groups would stay where and for how long, and how satisfied they were with what was offered to them.\u201d It became clear that this sort of information was in demand, with both marketing and tourism companies. Before Mapcase, it hadn't been possible to collect and utilize this data using conventional methods. Companies were intrigued by the ability to identify preferences, usage patterns of regional facilities, and satisfaction levels in a timely fashion. \u201cOur interactivity and real-time insight into customers opens a direct channel between the tourism industry and their customers, allowing them to immediately react to current trends,\u201d says Kneissl. The challenge for MapCase was to process those continuous streams of huge amounts of data in the shortest possible time and in a way that would allow a wide variety of companies in the tourism industry to leverage the results when making their decisions. Initial attempts at manually analyzing the data and creating reports that made sense had taken almost four full days. When evaluating a range of analytics products, the MapCase team was focused on a few factors. They wanted to be able to quickly move from huge amounts of data to comprehensible reports in the shortest amount of time possible. In the end it came down to either Looker or Tableau. \u201cHere, Tableau was able to show its great strengths: not just the ease of use and the beauty of the dashboards, but also the enormous speed. Compared to conventional methods, the speed of Tableau was a quantum leap for us,\u201d says Bastian Kneissl. \u201cAnd last but not least Tableau stood out with its stability and by being ca. $10,000 less expensive than Looker in a comparable configuration.\u201d Tableau quickly became the key element in analytics at MapCase. In addition to meeting all of their requirements, employees learned how to use the software within days. Kneissl remembers, \u201cOne of our staff had downloaded the free Tableau trial and started working with it. He didn\u2019t want to stop. Without any training, just through learning by doing, it took him only two to three days to succeed. Meanwhile he has completed a short training at Tableau and he is still delighted with the tool.\u201d Today, there are two people at MapCase that use Tableau Desktop to create visualizations and dashboards. The source data is stored mainly in an Amazon Redshift database. To add more value to their analyses, MapCase incorporates data from other sources such as websites, social media campaigns, or hotel rating websites. The first dashboards were focused on analyzing usage patterns in winter sports centers. As a result, MapCase offers its analytics solution based on Tableau Server under the brand MountLytics. With a number of satisfied customers, MapCase has bridged a gap in the market. The level of interest from prospective customers is very promising. When the winter sports season starts, Mapcase recieves a lot of inquiries from tourism managers, who have stated thinking of new ways to leverage the information. With Tableau, it is easy to add new capabilities. As new use cases develop, MapCase specialists can develop new marketing tools such as customer loyalty and engagement systems. \u201cThanks to Tableau, we are naturally able to quickly incorporate additional data sources that our customer segment is especially interested in\u201d, says Kneissl. Digitalization is leading to more opportunities in the tourism industry, which is going through a period of upheaval. With help from Tableau, MapCase continues to innovate, creating closer, more distinct relationships between all parties. \u201cThis new business model has only been made possible by Tableau's lightning-fast, interactive, real-time analytics,\" Kneissl summarizes. Since there is virtually no competition at the moment, MapCase executives are very enthusiastic about the future. \u201cWe are planning to expand into further markets with new apps, new analyses and in new regions,\u201d says Kneissl. \u201cWe are very confident that with the help of Tableau we can become one of the major players out there.\u201d"

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Star Health and Allied Insurance Co Ltd. is India's first standalone health insurance company. The company is a joint venture between Oman Insurance Company, leading NRIs and several Indian business houses. Its subsequent investors include ICICI Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Tata Capital. Star Health was using a business intelligence (BI) platform that was extremely vendor-dependent, making the analytics and reporting process slower and costlier. The company chose Tableau because it could provide multiple source connectivity, in-memory technology, and most importantly, the ability to generate reports internally without vendor dependency. Today, roughly 400 employees interact and view Tableau visualizations built on up to 70 million rows of data (800GB). Star Health has a pan-India presence with a network base of about 300 offices and 600 one man offices across the country servicing its 1.5 million customers through 6000+ hospitals, providing cashless hospitalization. \u201cAs an insurance company, our entire business hinges on the availability of reliable data. Our pricing and modelling depends on analysis of data, not only from our products but also from external sources in the industry,\u201d said Mr. Sethuraman Kannan, CIO and Vice President of Information Technology Star Health Insurance. Beyond pricing and modelling, the company relies on data analysis to inform everything from provider performance to new product development and regulation compliance. Initially, the company used Microsoft Excel to maintain reports and databases. But working with such large amounts of data\u2014Star Health has more than 1.5 million customers and policies in India\u2014in Excel made it vulnerable and unstable. Managing this data was a challenge. Star Health decided to invest in a Business Intelligence platform in the year 2010. Despite switching to the new platform, several challenges remained. Since it was a customized tool rather than an off-the-shelf product, the company needed to work with the vendor to generate each report. As a result, the internal team was not in a position to produce ad-hoc reports in a timely or cost-efficient manner. The Claims department needs to analyze factors such as the incurred claims ratio against the premium procured and performance of network hospitals with respect to turnaround times, costs, etc. The Product Development team needs to conceptualize and design new products. When a new insurance product is developed, data on existing products is analyzed vis-\u00e0-vis external information. This helps the actuarial team model new prototypes based on market requirements. Before launching the product, the company needs to submit detailed reports with the Indian Government\u2019s Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), which can be done using Tableau. For instance, if the company were to float an insurance product for diabetes, it would need to analyze a variety of data to arrive at the optimum pricing model. In addition to internal data, Star Health might look at the incidence of diabetes in the country, age groups, or geographies that are most affected, or causes of the disease, for example. Even from a regulatory standpoint, insurance companies need to submit several reports on internal data to authorities. With the earlier tool, it was tough for the company to accurately estimate timelines for the generation of each report and anticipate the impact on other reports in the pipeline. Dependency on the vendor slowed down processes and drove up costs. Star Health was looking for an alternate tool with multiple source connectivity, in-memory technology and more importantly, the ability to generate reports internally without vendor dependency. Star Health identified Tableau as the tool that would meet its requirements, based on Tableau's performance on the Gartner Magic Quadrant. They selected Bodhtree Consultancy Ltd., as an implementation partner. The implementation was carried out by a joint team of eight from Bodhtree Consulting and Star Health. Implementation took 4 months, from the selection of the tool to going live. This was possible on account of the fact that Star Health could lean on experience gained from implementing the earlier solution, as well as the cooperation from Bodh Tree consulting. Today, a five member team at Star Health takes care of all data requirements and builds data visualizations in Tableau Desktop. These analysts access up to 800GB of data stored in Oracle and Microsoft Excel platforms for their analysis. They publish visualizations in Tableau Server, where 300 to 400 employees across departments log in to view and interact with the data. The company uses local authorization to secure data access. Tableau use is expanding quickly at Star Health; the company has rolled out Tableau to all its branches and plans to make it available to its sales force in the future. Mr. S. Kannan said, \u201cStatistics are very important when it comes to the insurance industry. For example, our reports need to justify pricing and authenticity to the IRDA for us to launch new products. Tableau helps us to seamlessly generate all the reports that we need.\u201d Tableau\u2019s user-friendly interface and analysis speed has had a significant impact on all teams that are using the software. Reports are generated quickly, so the time lag between report request and generation is reduced considerably. Since the tool is user friendly, it is possible to filter and choose the exact report required. \u201cTableau has minimized report generation time to one tenth of the original. And the best part is that users can generate reports on their own, without having to rely on the vendor, which significantly cuts cost,\u201d said Mr. S. Kannan. He added, \u201cTableau has been worth the investment. Combined with our expertise, it is a huge success at Star Health. All the users are quite happy.\u201d Star Health is growing steadily. The adoption of Tableau Server has suited the organization because customer data can be regularly updated. The ability to maintain the software in-house, instead of relying on the vendor, has been a big plus for Star Health. Above all, the company feels self-sufficient with the ease of use and customization that Tableau has to offer."

A Sino-foreign joint venture with extensive local expertise and global resources, the company delivers end-to-end telecommunications solutions and services in wireless and wireline, as well as network management. The company is dedicated to making communications more innovative, sustainable, and accessible for people, businesses and governments. This why Dr. Liu Qing (\u67f3\u537f), Director of Professional Service Innovation (\u4e13\u4e1a\u670d\u52a1\u521b\u65b0\u603b\u76d1) at Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell (\u4e0a\u6d77\u8d1d\u5c14\u80a1\u4efd\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), and his team of 10 data analysts work hard to ensure security and stability of its networks. Dr. Liu Qing, Director of Professional Service Innovation at Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell, and his Professional Service Innovation team wanted to boost productivity and lower costs. They knew that the answer existed in their large amount of data. It was only a matter of analyzing it and retrieving useful, actionable information. According to Dr. Liu, the team was using simple spreadsheets like Excel to sort data and manually chart and present the information. It was time consuming and the end deliverables did not deliver many insights. For example, the team couldn\u2019t see the full perspective of a communication network when they analyzed network data. They could look at the data from the equipment and resource angle, or downtime and errors angle, or see its performance against its key performance index\u2014but never all at once. Also, equipment assessments could take up to three months. Nevertheless, this assessment work is crucial. The view helps customers understand if they are gaining their required return on investment. For sales staff, the insights allow them to learn from experience and understand the actual resource requirement for projects of similar size. Dr. Liu said, \u201cIt was not just time consuming to analyze the large amount of data using spreadsheets. The process was prone to error since much of the work was done manually. The view we get on the data is also limited, and it was difficult to gain any useful insights from it.\u201d Dr. Liu also manages 80 technical support personnel who are constantly deployed to various sites across the country, depending on requirements in the field. He needed a tool that could help him accurately identify the need for skills upgrades on the team. Also, he needed to ensure that he is deploying staff with the right skill-sets to each on-site job. His old system had no data visualization, which made it difficult to see skill gaps and determine the location of personnel. Dr. Liu started looking for a data analytics and visualization tool. His team evaluated a number of solutions and found Tableau to be most suitable as it allowed them to work with a large amount of data easily and quickly. Currently, Dr. Liu\u2019s team uses Tableau to analyze all kinds of data, large and small. They leverage Tableau to analyze network log data and identify areas of discrepancies and irregularity. The information allows them to quickly access problems and resolve issues, which is crucial to maintaining a stable network and ensuring security. The data comes in structured and unstructured formats, originating from up to six different sources, belonging to various network applications. The team sometimes uses Splunk to clean up the data before feeding it into Tableau for analysis. Dr. Liu and his team also use Tableau to look into network equipment data. With Tableau, they can get a full picture of equipment deployment and identify wastage. Tableau allows them to look into the data and see each equipment item, which project it has been assigned to, and whether it has been fully utilized. Besides the Professional Service Innovation team, staff across different departments at Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell also use Tableau. Staff now place relevant analytics findings on Tableau Server so that other users can access and make use of the information. Dr. Liu estimates that about 30 people access the Tableau dashboards for the information. Some are also exploring how to access information on mobile devices like tablets. According to Dr. Liu, his team can now completely assess the equipment required for a communication network. He can complete end-to-end assessments in one week with Tableau, compared to one to three months previously with traditional analytics tools. Dr. Liu commented, \u201cWe are now able to see the entire network from multiple angles. This is because with Tableau, we can quickly change the perspective and what we want to explore in the same dataset, switching between what we want to focus on. This offers the team much better overall control and management of the network.\u201d Tableau is now also used to efficiently manage and deploy technical support personnel. Dr. Liu said, \u201cTableau allows us to keep track of this team, accurately identifying where there is a need for skills upgrade and accurately match resource available with the skills requirement onsite.\u201d They use Tableau visualizations to get a clear, weekly picture of skill gaps on the team. These gaps may exist because of system upgrades, change in equipment, etc. \u201cIt would have required us up to four days to come up with such a report prior to Tableau. Now all we need are two to three hours,\u201d he added. Dr. Liu feels that self-service analytics, where users see and experiment with their own data, is a much more effective way of analyzing data and presenting it to users. \u201cWe can trust the analysis because with Tableau, data error is almost non-existing as data is directly fed into the software for analysis and there is no human element in between,\u201d explained Dr. Liu. Dr. Liu also shared that he now actively advocates the use of Tableau within his company, helping others learn and consulting on where Tableau can be effectively applied."

Today, they share data with the whole organization over Tableau Server\u2014and other departments are catching on. Members from the Digital Marketing team discovered that they could even use Tableau to discover prospective customers, advancing the business. In the near future, Mr. Mitsuda from the Corporate Planning Division expects that other departments will experience a similar workflow change. In the future, he says that he would like to make Tableau a \u201cbasic skillset\u201d for employees. Tableau: Was there a particular problem you were facing? Yasuo Kojiro, IT Team: The great part about using Tableau is that we can see data from the entire company. We used to analyze data in each department, but we could never see data cross-sectionally. With this BI tool Tableau, we are getting a new vision of the data. Our business users used to store and analyze their data using MS Office products such as Access, Excel, and PowerPoint. There were so many different databases, and users analyzed their data in different manners they liked. That was one of the challenges our IT department had. Tableau: How did your implementation start? Masato Mitsuda, Corporate Planning Division: Our IT department introduced Tableau to us first. We thought it was just the right solution to solve our problems we had. Mr. Kojiro: As IT, our mission is to provide our users with accurate data. So I had to check our data with our Planning department. IT didn\u2019t take all the lead in bringing Tableau to our company. Tableau: Tell us more about Gulliver International.

I am responsible for business development planning and budget management. Tableau: How do you use Tableau? Mr. Mitsuda: Members from our Digital Marketing team and 3D room, which I am managing, are using Tableau. We use Tableau to visualize data of each department to create a report. We also use Tableau to discover prospective customers. Tableau: What are the most important benefits for you from Tableau Server? Mr. Kojiro: There are two benefits in using Tableau Server. The first one is that we can see data through a web browser even when the data is stored in our antiquated system. The second is that all the data sources can be centralized in Tableau Server. The results that differed depending on users will be consistent with Tableau Server. Tableau: How has Tableau changed things? Mr. Mitsuda: I used to use Access and Excel to analyze data and PowerPoint to share, but Tableau changed it completely. I expect other members to experience the same change, and this will hopefully lead to bring a change to the way we work across the company. Tableau: What\u2019s next for your company and Tableau? Mr. Mitsuda: In the future, we would like to expand the use of Tableau in our company as a basic skillset for a certain level of the staff."

        "content": "Groupon is an e-commerce company with a mission to empower the consumer while supporting local merchants across the globe. With Tableau, Groupon makes decisions about website structure, merchandising, and mobile optimization. The product team combines all of this data into an interactive visualization that summarizes performance\u2014allowing the team to see an overall view or drill down into a particular experiment. Report preparation that used to take up to three days is complete within a day. Today, Groupon's Tableau Server environment contains hundreds of dashboards and Meghna Suresh, Product Manager says that \"people always want more [Tableau].\" Tableau: How important is data to Groupon? Meghna Suresh, Product Manager: Being in the online retail business, placement is really everything. And it's very interesting because you can draw a lot of parallels to a brick and mortar retail business in which, when you think about walking into any big-box store in America, say Target or Walmart, you walk in the store. There are certain things that are merchandised at the front of the store. There are other things that are merchandised towards the back. We think about placement on the site in a very similar way. So it's what goes front and center on our homepage? How big should we make the search bar? Should we have a map on our browse page when people are looking for local deals? We use data to pretty much inform every decision that we make. Tableau: How are you using Tableau to visualize data and guide those decisions? Meghna By using data and being able to visualize it with Tableau in creative ways, we're really able to come up with what the optimal placement and layout of our site should be and how does that look different for every customer? And so it really informs every aspect of the customer experience. On the product side, we made a ton of changes to what we merchandise and where on the site. And also, we run A/B tests all the time. So being able to measure and dissect these A/B tests is one thing that's been really, really valuable to us in Tableau. We're running hundreds of these things at any given time across our website and mobile apps and our touch site. Just being able to look at one visualization that summarizes all of the performance of different experiments, and then being able to drill down into not only how is this experiment doing, but is it working better for one segment of our users than another? It literally informs almost everything customers see on the site on a daily basis. Tableau: What has been the reaction to Tableau? Meghna I would say people always want more. And I think that was a big part of how Tableau even became this big enterprise-wide solution at Groupon that it's become. If you log into Groupon's Server environment, you'll just see hundreds and hundreds of dashboards. And that's primarily how people interact with it. I think that's the nice thing, we used to be in a phase where we had to e-mail files around, and now you can just click on a URL and it takes you straight to what you're supposed to be looking at. So that's just made it really easy for us. Tableau: What impact has Tableau had at Groupon? Meghna I would say it's increased productivity a lot, because people used to engage in a lot of manual reporting activities before that are now automated with Tableau. We\u2019ve got all of these weekly meetings that analysts would routinely spend a lot of time preparing for in the past. If the meeting was on Wednesday, it would take all day Monday and Tuesday to prepare for that meeting. And now I'm seeing people are able to actually meet on the data and start discussing it on Monday afternoon. When people are able to start out with that common base of knowledge, and when that common base of knowledge is so visual, highly interactive, and easy to slice and dice, you can just cut to the chase and get to the decision-making. That's what's really simplified and democratized this process for us. Tableau: Are you seeing any other benefits since implementing Tableau? Meghna If you were to quantify the cost savings from people not having to spend three days on a task that now takes just half a day, I'm sure those would add up and be huge. But we haven't actually gone out and tried to do it, although that would be a great idea. Tableau: What data sources do you connect to? Meghna There are people that probably exclusively use Excel as the data source of choice. I personally tend to hook directly into our data warehouse wherever possible. It creates more automated and streamlined reporting and analysis. There are also integrations that you can do with Hadoop and R. I've seen people across the company use those as well. I think that's a really exciting phase of Tableau's product development is all of the different data sources that you can connect to. Tableau: How has Tableau streamlined data analysis across Groupon? Meghna Before, people tended to sort of go off and do more sort of ad-hoc analysis. With a Tableau solution like this one, and many other reporting solutions we have around our products, people are able to come to one common source of truth. That really makes a difference because when you're sitting in a meeting, everyone at least agrees on the numbers, right? In a lot of contexts, you've got instances where people are actually coming from a different base of knowledge. And you first have to reconcile that before you can actually get to the real conversation of what should I place on the home page and what should I place on this other page?"

        "content": "NTT DATA Corporation is a large, leading Japanese system integration company. The company runs data communication and system development businesses. Mr. Kenichi Kuroki works in the Information Technology Management Office, which provides information systems for internal use in NTT DATA and their affiliate companies. His major role includes building and expanding BI infrastructures with Tableau. NTT DATA adopted Tableau based on the Tableau Drive methodology, starting with a dedicated business intelligence plan and then rolling it out to their companies. With Tableau, IT can easily monitor data in an integrated way, whether it is managed by a system or by a department. Business users can now analyze data and make changes by themselves, accelerating their PDCA (plan-do-check-action) cycle across the organization. Tableau: What encouraged you and your organization to check out Tableau? Mr. Kenichi Kuroki, Deputy Manager, System Development Group, Information Technology Management Office: When I watched the demo, I especially thought it was a very interesting tool. For those who don\u2019t have any special BI skills, they can still operate data intuitively and easily and obtain knowledge, and I felt like that is extremely attractive. There were quite a few cases of people who started using Tableau with no BI skills and they enjoyed analyzing data while using it\u2014and they ended up becoming fans of Tableau. I feel that there aren\u2019t many tools like that that you can use easily. Tableau: What does your job involve? Mr. Kuroki: The department I belong to provides information systems for NTT DATA and NTT DATA group. I\u2019m in charge of the relevant BI work there and my role is to build a BI platform for the company using Tableau to spread our product. Tableau: What departments are using Tableau at NTT DATA? Mr. Kuroki: Firstly, we have been trying to expand this product into companies for the head of the organization and their network of staff, where the important decisions are made inside the company. We had a small start in terms of the number of users, so we don\u2019t have many so far, but 15 organizations introduced themselves four months after starting and the number is increasing. Tableau: How large is the data you work with, and in what formats or systems? Mr. Kuroki: Currently, we work on a couple of million rows of data, we would like to take care of tens of millions of rows of data. We use various data formats such as Oracle, Excel and Access. For example, when we don\u2019t have enough system data for necessary analysis we fill in the gaps with data using Excel and \"blend\" it all and use it. Tableau: Was there a particular problem you were facing? Mr. Kuroki: The work environment of each company structure is varied, so we have carried on conducting necessary analysis in a timely fashion with each organization utilizing Tableau, so that we can provide analysis in a timely fashion that matches the work environment. In the past, the IT department used to listen to the requests of user departments and offered to develop reports. But with that, we couldn\u2019t avoid taking too much time before providing reports and had problems answering the detailed analysis needs. Tableau: What does Tableau allow you to do? Mr. Kuroki: Up until now, both data managed in the system and individually managed data at each organization was monitored individually, but Tableau made it all in one to allow for easy monitoring. Also, fixing how the report looks in detail and adding contents are done quickly by user department staff and this is the effect we can see. From these things, we have been working on it hoping to accelerate the PDCA cycle of companies and each organization. Tableau: What are the most important benefits for you from Tableau Server? Mr. Kuroki: The biggest merit of using the Tableau Server is being able to securely share reports in a timely fashion, I believe. Tableau: How did your implementation start? Mr. Kuroki: For introducing Tableau, the introduction methodology regarding self-service BI named Tableau Drive is a good reference, I think. Based on that, we are working in four divided phases. Grasp the current condition first, organize the future structure, do plot typing and sort the base of development for the company and develop it in actual companies, that\u2019s the flow. We incorporated the know-how that was gained in the development as an additional element in Tableau Drive and we are managing it as our own unique methodology now. We have been utilizing it for other companies\u2019 Tableau introductions as well."

CyberAgent is also the parent company of Ameba, a popular Japanese social networking and blogging site.

Creating reports required scripting SQL queries, which slowed down production time and delayed insights. Since adopting Tableau, the CyberAgent team doesn't have to rely on coding to deliver reports. With Tableau, CyberAgent can: Tableau: How has Tableau changed things? Ken Takao, Infrastructure Manager, Technology Strategy Department: Since Tableau was introduced to us, we have been gaining a data-driven mindset. Before, we would depend on our experiences and intuitions a lot in many aspects such as ad distribution, logistics, or how to increase our sales. Tableau: Tell us more about CyberAgent. Mr. Takao: We have been conducting our business to become a company representing the 21st century in the internet industry. There are four business departments in our company: advertisements, community, gaming, and Ameba. Tableau: What does your job involve? Mr. Takao: Our department is called AdTech Headquarters and we are in charge of advertisements. We have more than 20 products in our AdTech Studio and we use Tableau to analyze those products. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted you personally? Mr. Takao: As I have used Tableau, I have gained an ability to think with data in mind. It used to take too much time to see a huge amount of data in a report. But Tableau now helps us with reporting because dashboards can be created quickly. Tableau: What does Tableau allow you to do? Mr. Takao: We used to use different analytics tools with different data infrastructures for each product. BI tools were used for some products, but not for every product. So we had different data visualizations for all products. But we unified the data visualizations with Tableau. Tableau enables us to visualize data so quickly that we can now detect error values and accesses that we could not detect before in usual operations. Tableau is so useful that we can also access various KPIs of ad distribution. Tableau: Tell us more about your data sources and storage. Mr. Takao: AdTech is a system for advertisement distribution, which means we always have to handle a vast amount of data. We handle dozens of petabytes in Hadoop and hundreds of nodes for Redshift. Data storage varies from BigQuery and Redshift to Hadoop. There are also some use cases of using as data mart by importing data from MySQL and CSV files. Basically we use MySQL to store the master data for most of the products. We blend the master data on MySQL and data on Hadoop or Redshift to extract. Tableau: What roles use Tableau at CyberAgent? Mr. Takao: Data scientists, application engineers, and server-side software engineers. They use Tableau to create a dashboard as a report for their managers and sales team. Tableau: How much of a difference does that time savings make? Mr. Takao: Without Tableau, when we would have to output a report with data, we need to consider how to get the data before scripting SQL queries. With Tableau, however, data can be extracted directly from data sources. This shortened the time it takes to acquire insights. Tableau: What benefits have you experienced from using Tableau Server? Mr. Takao: Tableau Server has a major advantage which can be accessed through a website. It\u2019s sometimes difficult for our customers to install an application to their PCs to see data, but Tableau Server is quite useful because our customers can see data on Tableau Server once their account is issued. Tableau: What do you recommend to others considering Tableau? Mr. Takao: I would recommend them to use a trial version. They cannot help choosing Tableau once they connect it to the data source and play with it for an hour. Tableau is so easy to use. We can generate a report by just clicking a mouse without reading operation manuals. There is also the Tableau community where I can find a solution to a problem that I cannot solve by myself, but by discussing with other users. With these benefits, I will recommend people interested in Tableau to start with a trial."

        "company": "ConSol",
        "content": "After evaluating a variety of solutions, the company decided to implement Tableau, because the self-service model fit the company\u2019s philosophy for employees to act as independent entrepreneurs. Today, decision makers can create their own reports within one hour. Day-to-day decision making at the company has seen significant improvements. By introducing Tableau Server, ConSol* has taken a big step towards their goal of democratizing company data throughout the organization. ConSol* Consulting & Solutions Software GmbH, founded in 1984, is a German IT full service provider for businesses of all sizes. Aside from their headquarters in Munich and branch offices in D\u00fcsseldorf, the company has subsidiaries in Dubai, Austria, Poland, and Romania. The company portfolio includes a complete range of IT services as well as its self-developed business process management software ConSol*CM. ConSol* uses a solution by Navision for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and stores everything in a data warehouse. Apart from typical business purposes such as cost, revenue, and profit analysis, ConSol* mainly requires reports for project controlling. \u201cFor us it\u2019s essential to know how well the individual departments are doing,\u201d says Henning von Kielpinski, Departmental Manager of Business Development Partner & Alliances at ConSol*. \u201cWe are a consulting company, a software developer, and a product manufacturer. In most cases we are working on projects. That\u2019s why it is so important to know which projects are going well and which aren\u2019t, how the timelines are developing, when invoices are sent, and when payments are received. We also need to keep track of how our actual expenses compare to our calculations.\u201d In the past, one employee in controlling was responsible for creating all business and project related reports for the executive management. That employee was working with data warehouse extracts in Excel. As the business grew more complex, the waiting times for reports and analyses grew longer and longer. \u201cWe had to wait up to four weeks for our latest figures, for things such as month-end closing,\u201d says Henning von Kielpinski. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t accept these delays in getting our basis for important and time-critical decisions any longer.\u201d With seven people constantly requesting new or modified reports, the controlling department was forced to hand out Excel files with base data and leave the analysis to the executives themselves. There simply wasn\u2019t the capacity to deal with the ever increasing urgency of requests. \u201cBecause even the BI tools of our data warehouse were falling way short of our requirements, we were looking for an analytics solution that was powerful, fast and visually pleasing. But it should also be easy enough to use that non-mathematicians like myself could use it,\u201d says Henning von Kielpinski. When ConSol* was looking for a new tool, they evaluated a variety of solutions such as SAP Business Objects or Pentaho. They all proved to be either too complex or inflexible for the intended purpose. Either way, the time to result was not satisfactory. \u201cAs a departmental manager, I required quick analytics. So I decided to install the Tableau trial and started to look at the data for my department with that,\u201d says Henning von Kielpinski. \u201cAfter a few days I was so happy with the tool, I bought a Tableau Desktop license with my own money,\u201d he adds with a smile. \u201cThe company reimbursed me for that quite a while ago.\u201d Today, ConSol* has provided seven Tableau Desktop licenses to the main decision makers within the company. Tableau workbooks are now the format of choice for sharing analyses between employees. While some employees receive static reports exported from Tableau to PDF, \u201cTableau Reader allows colleagues to take an active approach and explore their datasets from different angles,\u201d explains Henning von Kielpinski. In total, about 30 employees regularly use Tableau. Based on user satisfaction, the number of use cases for Tableau is steadily growing. The company has recently purchased a license for Tableau Server to deliver results to an even larger number of users. \u201cWe are trying to break up a few colleague\u2019s isolationist mentality regarding data. Our goal is to further democratize data throughout the company,\u201d says Henning von Kielpinksi. Tableau users at ConSol* have taken advantage of Tableau training resources to advance their skills. \u201cWe were all helping each other and using the many and varied online training videos by Tableau, when we were trying to get something done for a more specific use case,\u201d says Henning von Kielpinski. With Tableau, ConSol* was able to completely remove delays in reporting. Project controlling and financial reports that took up to four weeks to complete are now available within the hour. But not just report creation is much faster. Thanks to the visual quality and interactivity, report consumption is now also fast and flexible. As a result, day-to-day decision making has improved significantly. \u201cMy colleagues now have a far more targeted approach to searching the data of their areas of responsibility for the insights they need,\u201d says Henning von Kielpinski. \u201cThey are no longer bound by a rigid analytics concept. There is no waiting involved when a report needs to be created differently or changed in some way. They have become completely self-sufficient. That\u2019s what I call self-service BI. Our company philosophy is to have employees act as co-entrepreneurs. Tableau is a great help in putting that into practice. With Tableau we were able to create the conditions for largely independent action throughout the entire company.\u201d The employee in controlling who used to dedicate his days to creating reports for executives, is now able to spend more time on more worthwhile projects, such as creating unified reporting standards or a comparative analysis of all ConSol* business units. By adopting Tableau Server, ConSol* will soon be able to make data accessible to everyone throughout the organization. The Tableau Server access control functions integrate seamlessly with the in-house security concept to keep sensitive data safe. When a customer was submitting a ticket about server performance of his ConSol*CM setup, the company stumbled upon another interesting use case for Tableau. A ConSol* employee used Tableau to analyze the customers\u2019 server logs. He identified unusual load patterns and quickly found the cause of poor server performance. As a result, ConSol* was able to quickly apply countermeasures and resolve the issue to the customers\u2019 full satisfaction. At the moment, ConSol* is evaluating the integration of Tableau Server components into their own ConSol*CM solution for the analysis of server logs. \u201cWorking with Tableau was always a pleasure. We always saw eye-to-eye. It was just good chemistry,\u201d concludes Henning von Kielpinski. \u201cDespite - or maybe because of - the many options and capabilities of the software, working with Tableau always feels like I can follow my play instinct to my heart\u2019s content. It is fast, very easy to use and non-destructive with regards to the source data. Personally I really appreciate being able to run Tableau on a laptop computer without requiring access to a mainframe \u2013 as is the case with a lot of other solutions. That\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t want to miss.\u201d"

Tableau Server serves as a front-end platform for teachers, principals, and leadership to interact with data from the Uplift Education data warehouse and Excel spreadsheets. Dashboards present unified profiles of students and teachers, displaying data about tests, grades, attendance, compliance, and more. With all of this data at their fingertips, teachers can understand how to meet the needs of their students, and adapt as needed. With Tableau, Uplift Education can be proactive in their mission to \u201cempower students to reach their highest potential.\u201d Tableau: Can you tell us a little bit about Uplift Education? Thomas Hay, Director of Data Strategy: We're a network of 34 schools on 17 campuses with just over 14,000 students. And many of our students will be the first in their families to attend college. Our goal is to really prepare students to get to and through college and to be able to contribute to their community and do great things. Tableau: How is Tableau making an impact at Uplift Education? Thomas: Tableau is helping us further our mission at Uplift Education by serving as really the front-end platform for our teachers, principals, and leadership to really interact with the vast sources of data that we have from many different data warehouses, Excel spreadsheets. So Tableau helps us in the furthering of our mission by providing an interactive platform that we can aggregate the vast variety of data sources that we have into a central location. 31 of our schools are Title One schools, so that means that they have a high number of students from low-income families. So they can understand how students are progressing through the Uplift curriculum, where there might be opportunities for reteach because of potential misunderstanding Tableau: What kind of dashboards are you viewing in Tableau? How does faculty access the data? Thomas: So we connect Tableau to our data warehouse and we use Tableau Server and Tableau Desktop to display dashboards that are pulling together a unified profile of a student, unified profiles of teachers, showing information on tests, whether they're local, state, or nationally normed tests to show how students are progressing through our curriculum, to highlight students that may need additional support and help. We also use it as a way for them to export data. So if they want to pull down data on a particular student or their classroom or their school, they're able to do that using the export features that are part of Tableau. Tableau: What would you do if you didn't have Tableau? Thomas: Without Tableau, we wouldn't have a way to show all of these different data sources in one place. And our teachers and principals would have to spend time going to all those different locations to pull that together. Tableau: Have you gotten a lot of value from Tableau at Uplift Education? Thomas: We are big proponents of using Tableau to allow our teachers to see their data, drill down into it, find some additional insight, and use that to help in their practice, whether it's lesson planning or designing tutoring blocks or intervention for students, so that they can make the most of their time and the most of the tests and homework, and other data that they are collecting on a daily basis. Tableau: How has Tableau changed day-to-day processes at Uplift Education? Thomas: Using Tableau and being able to visualize and pull together many different data sources, it's really allowed us to leverage some of the research that has been done in education around the best ways that students learn certain skills\u2014and be able to track those skills over time. As well as pull together data that we know from research indicates a student might be getting off track from being on grade level or potentially not learning certain material in a way that will set them up for success later on. Tableau: How has that impacted the teachers? Thomas: So by pulling that information together and then being able to highlight it, we're able to take statistical modeling that we do or other analysis and make it touchable. Teachers can go and actually interact with it and see it and feel it. In many ways, it makes that research living for them because it's living in the students that they have. And they're able to track those indicators that may have existed many different places to start all in one location. And tell them that unified story of a student. Tableau: How is that creating positive changes on campuses? Thomas: So our ability to really effect change with students has come through sort of a theory on our part that if we're able to drill down learning to discrete elements that we can observe and better understand, we can help guide teachers in their practice so that they're better able to meet the needs of their students. The insights that we've seen from our dashboards that have, you know, brought a bit of surprise, in a good way, to our eyes is where there might be certain gaps at particular grade levels. And that allows us to use the resources at our central office to stack hands and help campuses where they might need that help, or reach out to them proactively to ask what they might need and work with them to create better learning outcomes for their students."

The products transform CRM software into a complete sales, marketing, and operations platform. KORE\u2019s customers understand their data through Tableau visualizations embedded into the cloud software product. Russell Scibetti, Vice President of Product Strategy shares how customers benefit from interactive, easy-to-understand reports, regardless of technical skill. Tableau Server makes it easy for the KORE team to set permissions on sites, projects, and workbooks\u2014ensuring security and pleasing customers. Tableau: What\u2019s happening with the data professional sporting organizations collect today? Russell Scibetti, Vice President of Product Strategy: Sports right now is undergoing a bit of a data revolution in terms of the volume of data every team is collecting, the amount of resources that they're putting behind, more analysts, more technology platforms. It's really a tremendous opportunity. Tableau: Who uses KORE software? Russell: KORE has had a lot of success in the professional sports arena. At this point, more than half of the professional sports teams in North America use one or more of our products. Tableau: What does KORE software do? Russell: So our software comes into play to help them manage those relationships. Everything from nurturing fans, from being a single-game buyer all the way to a full season ticket holder. And managing the relationship for corporate partners. Tableau: Where does Tableau fit into your services? Russell: Our application runs in the cloud. And so as an OEM partner of Tableau, we run our own OEM Tableau Server that is multi-site, supports all of our different customers inside of a single cloud software product. Tableau: What does being a Tableau OEM Partner provide to your customers? Russell: The logical extension of that is providing more data, more reports, more understanding across an entire organization. So it was key for us to identify a product that was very interactive, that could provide very easy-to-understand reports, regardless of the level of organization of that particular staff member, and really just bring everything together in a very easy-to-digest, easy-to-work-with manner. Being a SaaS application, it's really critical for us to have a strong multi-tenant architecture. Tableau fits really seamlessly into that with the site structure, with the API and the other commands available to manage across multiple sites, all the different levels of permissions from the sites down to the projects down to the workbooks. Tableau: How do you serve multiple clients with Tableau Server? Russell: We have a very common data schema that all of our customers use. So the ability for us to push that content across different customers that have that common schema, but still maintain that security across those customers, has worked really well. Tableau: Which Tableau visualizations are working the best for you? Russell: We've got several popular visualizations that our customers like to use. On the ticketing side, we provide interactive maps that allow customers and our teams to compare different audiences of ticket buyers. Let me see the distribution of our season ticket holders compared to our single-game buyers. So the mapping and the geography is very popular. We provide data that compares primary ticket purchase price to secondary resell price so people can see the gap between their face value of the tickets that were sold and then how they were sold on the secondary market. That's also a pretty popular component on the ticketing side. Tableau: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to say about Tableau? Russell: Tableau can really cover the entire spectrum, whether you're a super user that knows SQL that can really dive into all of the formulas and calculations and statistics. Or a simple user, who's really just looking to have a better understanding of your basic reports. Tableau is the best to cover that spectrum of customers. Tableau: What other Tableau features are you digging in to? Russell: One of the things coming down the pike that I'm really excited about is the increased Web authoring functionality. So for our use case where we're providing a Tableau Server and our customers are connecting through that Tableau Server experience, the more we can empower them to continue to develop on the content we've created through that Web interface, or even through the mobile and tablet interfaces, which they also showed here at the conference. Tableau: What did you use for visualization before Tableau? Russell: Tableau's the first time we have brought in an external visualization solution. In the past, we've just built our own reports and we continue to do that. There are certain times where it makes sense for us to continue to build our own reports or build some of our own consoles where we have programmatic logic key to our application that is important for us to control. Tableau: Can you give us any details on the types of visualizations you are doing with Tableau? Russell: On the corporate partnership side, the visuals provide year-over-year reporting, year-over-year pipelines, forecasts of when contractual revenue is coming on and off the books. Insight into the inventory, the components of the deal, how much of our revenue is generated from digital media versus signage versus radio versus other assets. Tableau: Where is your data stored? Russell: CRM has always been using SQL Server, and our data warehouse product uses Amazon Redshift. It was also important us as an OEM partner, to select a platform that will operate across those different data sources so we don't have to create different siloes of different products for our data warehouse versus our CRM solutions. Tableau: What was integrating Tableau like for you? Russell: The integration process between Tableau and KORE has been pretty seamless. It's very easy to do a single sign-on, to be able to pass through so the end user never has to do a double logon to see the Tableau-generated content. Tableau: You must be working with a large amount of data. Russell: Clearly, we collect and manage a lot of data on behalf of our teams through our different software integrations and all the data that they're collecting directly through our product. So we were looking for a solution that can help advance the level of interactivity and display power of that information across the team. Tableau: Where does CRM fit into the picture with your customers? Russell: Sports teams are very active CRM users. They have a wide range of relationships to manage from the consumer side of their ticket buyers and fans all the way through to their corporate partners that are advertising with them. Tableau: Have you had to train your customers on Tableau? Russell: One of the nice things about Tableau is it's very easy to educate customers on how to use the product. I pretty much self taught myself through Tableau's existing documentation, training videos, manuals. When our customers are onboarding into our product and they want to start experimenting and playing around with the Tableau visuals, I can take them through the basic elements of training and how to create copies of dashboards, customize them, set their preferences. And I encourage them to do the same and do their own exploration using all the resources that Tableau provides through the website. So, really, it's been a very easy process to self teach how to get a lot out of the application."

        "company": "Pulse Mining",
        "content": "For 30 years, Pulse Mining Systems has delivered Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tools tailored to the mining industry. Based in the Newcastle / Hunter Region, the company provides services to support mining and the largest, coal-exporting port in the world. With a strong understanding of the processes and challenges inherent in mining, the company created a point of difference by offering products tailored to meet these unique requirements. After three decades in business, Pulse Mining realized it should take another look at its technology offering. Mark Spry was brought onboard as the new CEO; he set out to identify new revenue opportunities. This was hard, especially given that we are in the midst of a global mining industry downturn, particularly in relation to coal and iron ore, the two most significant resources, exported by Australia. Mining organizations have responded by cutting overheads, the obvious costs containment measures have been implemented and miners are now searching for ways to utilize the vast amount of (already) captured transactional data to drive greater insights and operational efficiencies. Spry quickly identified the need for simple, cost-effective and tactical business intelligence (BI) solution to help customers obtain these insights, and the Visualisation and Analytics (V&A) Division was born. Parvin evaluated a number of analytics solutions to identify the best BI technologies to integrate into Pulse Mining\u2019s offering. He was impressed with Tableau\u2019s ease of use and agility. Parvin also recognised that Pulse Mining could add value to their analytics by offering consulting services to help customers make the most of their data. Parvin\u2019s team required no training to use Tableau; their expertise combined with Tableau\u2019s usability meant they could launch straight into developing their analytics solution. Pulse Mining\u2019s new tactical BI offering is built on technology from Tableau and Tableau partner, Birst. The team created a set of \u2018plug-and-play\u2019 analytics products made for the mining industry that could deliver data visualisations from different areas of the business into a central hub. \u201cSince we\u2019ve pre-created the design and data modelling, we now offer our customers a set of mining specific analytics,\u201d said Parvin. \u201cOur customers can quickly and easily get insights using these templates and then create visualisations using Tableau. Once they have it, they can\u2019t live without it.\u201d Due to its compatibility with a variety of back-end data systems and unstructured data sources, Tableau is a strong component of the Pulse Mining BI offering. Pulse Mining has a breadth of customer data sources and Tableau is versatile enough to be utilised across all its customers. \u201cOur aim is to make it very easy for our customers to plug a product in, get the data flowing and create visualisations to help them monitor mine performance,\u201d said Parvin. \u201cThe longer it takes to roll out a BI solution, the more data builds up and waits to be analysed. By creating a simple and fast solution, our customers can get answers to the questions they\u2019ve been asking for years.\u201d Pulse Mining used Tableau on top of a data source created from a combination of custom Excel macros and connectors into established operational systems. From this they could then present solid examples of what the technology was capable of. Not only was Pulse Mining able to deliver insights to its customers, but it was able to do so fast. During an introductory presentation to Whitehaven Coal, Pulse Mining was able to answer a question about an operational anomaly on the spot; this question had been asked for over 20 years! \u201cWe were able to deliver analytics quickly and simply in next to no time,\u201d said Parvin. \u201cThis differs from other solutions that are often sold in as a theory, and insights can\u2019t be gained for some time.\u201d Pulse Mining delivered this offering to Whitehaven Coal in a very short timeframe. From the proof of concept, it was less than six months until the technology was being incrementally rolled out across the organisation. \u201cNot only does the solution offer Whitehaven Coal insights they couldn\u2019t have before,\u201d said Parvin, \u201cbut the out-of-the-box nature of the product means it\u2019s significantly more cost effective than building a custom BI solution. It is also simple to use and staff can be trained to obtain their own insights.\u201d Many of Pulse Mining System\u2019s clients have experienced massive savings in terms of sorting and analyzing data. For example, at one client site one employee has the sole focus of managing production data and determining the value and quantity of coal being produced on a daily basis. Blending data via Tableau has allowed employees to cross-reference data sets. In a particular instance, an employee blended finance and production data into a single report which made the answer much clearer. \u201cToday, instead of spending days administering data, the employee can focus on analysing the reports and identifying different behaviours and incidents and how they impact the bottom line,\u201d said Parvin. Pulse Mining initially sold four licenses to Whitehaven Coal and this has now increased to 20 across the company. \u201cTableau is helping our customers make sense of their otherwise disparate and siloed data,\u201d said Parvin. \u201cTake one example where staff at a mine were capturing data from water samples in individual, mismatched spreadsheets, without using common terminology. We worked with that customer to identify corresponding data points and by plugging that information into Tableau, the customer could deliver working, practical and informative analytics and reports,\u201d said Parvin. Pulse Mining\u2019s BI solution set is today allowing its customers to create visualisations on coal quality, the impacts of the coal extraction and transport process, machinery maintenance, and much more. Recently, they were even able to cross-reference coal quality data with GPS coordinates to showcase where in the mine the best quality coal is. The technology has seen an exciting uptake among new and existing mining customers and has delivered the new revenue stream that Pulse Mining was searching for. Since it has been built as an analytics fabric on top of Pulse Mining\u2019s ERP solution, this has ensured that the existing technology remains relevant and productive. \u201cWith this solution, we have found a way to make our customers\u2019 data work for them in ways it never has before \u2013 and they can do it quickly and cost-effectively,\u201d said Parvin."

        "content": "RedMart offers competitive prices on a wide range of groceries and household essentials, with the convenience of home delivery seven days a week. With its mission to save shoppers time and money for the important things in life, the company decided to invest in Tableau to enable real-time insights into buying patterns and trends. RedMart uses Tableau across various departments within the company including merchandising and commercial, marketing, customer service, corporate development and finance. Tableau helped the company improve customer service, business efficiencies, and operations. Using Tableau and Amazon Redshift, RedMart has been able to: \u2022 Cut down the time spent on analysis to about one fourth of the original \u2022 Gain real-time visibility into data, facilitating quicker decision making \u2022 Reduce report creation timelines from days to hours RedMart, a Singapore based online grocery marketplace, has a mission to save shoppers time and money for the important things in life. It offers competitive prices on a wide range of groceries and household essentials with the convenience of home delivery seven days a week. Founded in March 2011 by Roger Egan, Vikram Rupani, and Rajesh Lingappa, the company is backed by well-respected investors and advisors, including Toivo Annus (Skype Co-founder), Eduardo Saverin (Facebook Co-founder), Jason Ackerman (CEO of FreshDirect), Visionnaire Ventures, and SoftBank Ventures. The company management believes that customer centricity is the key for any e-commerce company, and is constantly looking for ways to become more customer centric. RedMart maintains a 100,000 square foot warehouse, which can store tens of thousands of items. The company regularly stocks more than 16,000 products, with more added on a regular basis. Fast, updated insight into inventory and shipment data is important to ensure RedMart meeting its customers\u2019 expectations. RedMart\u2019s business intelligence (BI) team also wanted to keep close track of customer behavior on the web and mobile channels. They knew that data could give them insights necessary to deliver personalized experiences, determine optimal pricing, and improve customer service. But while the team had the data they needed, they had no mechanism in place to get timely insights that could guide business decisions. Earlier the team was using a SAAS-based business intelligence tool that had limited reporting capacity, supporting only canned reports. Unfortunately, most of RedMart\u2019s data was in different silos and the reporting mechanism allowed for only one report at a time from each data source. Even worse, business users were not able to access the data themselves\u2014instead the IT department was required to handle report generation. Ad hoc reports took so long to create that the answers were stale by the time the reports were delivered. And if newer data became available, the report had to be run again\u2014a process that could take days. As a result, departments often resorted to producing their own analyses in Microsoft Excel, which isn\u2019t an ideal tool for this function since it takes longer and brings down the reliability of data. This process prevented management from making fast, informed, data-driven decisions. \u201cWe were keen on a tool that could produce useful, user-generated reports,\u201d said Prashant Parashivapgol, BI Architect, RedMart. \u201cFrom my experience, I knew Tableau was the best solution to help us transform data from multiple sources into useful information.\u201d \u201cIn September 2014, RedMart decided to move to a BI platform built on Amazon Redshift and Tableau. We chose this solution because it was easy to build and fast to implement,\u201d said Prashant. In about a month\u2019s time, two developers set up a collection of executive dashboards and reports. Now, RedMart has heads of each department using Tableau and interacting with the data for day-to-day operations. The BI team has integrated data from various systems\u2014fulfillment systems, warehouse management systems and other disparate sources like APIs, Google Analytics, and more. All of this data is stored in Amazon Redshift. Analysts build their data analyses in Tableau Desktop, which offers a native connector to Redshift. They publish completed reports to Tableau Server, a server-based collaboration solution. Business users can log into the Server and securely view and interact with any data analytics they have permissions to view. There is no need to share files or require any special connections. Today, the Tableau plus Redshift solution is used across RedMart. For example, the merchandising and commercial teams use Tableau to study margins and analyze category performance for optimal product selection. And the marketing team at RedMart uses on Tableau to study the uptake of various initiatives and improve promotional offers. The customer service team uses Tableau to track the number of customer contacts for any given day or week. The team can also analyze based on the type of contact, whether it is about a broken item or delayed delivery. They track this data on a weekly basis to identify trends; customer service measures are put in place accordingly. The Operations team looks at Tableau analyses to improve warehouse usage. They rely on Tableau to track entry and exit of each item to ensure optimal stock levels. And because employees can access the data to answer their own questions now, the BI team is spending less time on report generation. Instead, they are free to focus on strategic efforts such as data integration. With Tableau, departments have reduced report generation effort by 70-80 percent compared with their prior Excel-based effort. Using Amazon Redshift and Tableau, report creation is quick, even when analyzing millions of rows. The time taken to create a report has gone down from days to hours. Users can refresh existing reports without having to create an entire report from scratch in complicated query languages. \u201cTableau has been a catalyst for cultural change in the company as it brought in the data-driven culture,\u201d said Prashant. \u201cEvery team today has access to data that they rely on for day-to-day decision making.\u201d Greater data visibility has also facilitated more useful, informed discussions and meetings. With Tableau, data can be sliced and diced and summarized in numerous ways, which makes it easier to run promotions, source merchandise and execute operations efficiently. \u201cIn our organization, Tableau has undoubtedly paid for itself. The best ROI is that it has helped put a smile on our customers\u2019 faces. You can\u2019t put a number on that,\u201d said Rajesh. Since Tableau is easy to learn, users can create their own reports even without expertise in data reporting tools, since Tableau is intuitive with its drag and drop features. With RedMart planning to venture into Southeast Asia next year, it expects to confront different business problems and a much larger user base. But the team believes that Tableau will provide a strong foundation that will make it easier to enter new markets since it has data readily available from day one."

        "content": "In this video, Filip Dousek, Business Analytics Lead at Mibcon speaks about his experience sharing Tableau with customers. Customers realize that they can connect to systems like SAP BW in seconds. Even better, they can replace noisy reports with rich, interactive visualizations and immediately find business stories from gigabytes of data. Tableau: What is the end goal when you start working with customers? Filip Dousek, Business Analytics Lead: The end product of our work with Tableau is typically some improvement in performance of our clients. That is pretty much what we're looking for in the data and why we are doing visualizations, because they can improve the performance of a company. Tableau: And what sort of client data are you usually looking at? Filip: Typically our customers have some ERP systems. This might be SAP, this might be other systems. And we're giving them some further insights into their data using Tableau. So the typical customer using a traditional BI tool would have a set of reports, and maybe there are several hundred reports in a given company. And they are 95 percent noise. So when somebody is using these standard reports, you always will be looking every week at the same reports, and trying to look for some insight, trying to see whether something has changed from the last week, from the last month. Tableau: And how is it different with Tableau? Filip: Now when we come into the company with Tableau, we actually make sense of the data. There's a lot of data, a lot of different reports, and we really look for what is important, what are the business stories present in the data? And Tableau helps us visualize these business stories to pull just the important meaning out of gigabytes of data. Tableau: What reactions are you seeing from your customers? Filip: What I can see very clearly in the discussions that we have with our customers on the board level is that there is a change of mindset often happening during these discussions over our visualizations. It could be a new view of who their customers are. It could be a different perspective on what they are actually selling. So the result of mine may be one week, two weeks, three weeks of working with data in Tableau would be two or three slides that really shows something important for the company that it can take action on. Tableau: How is the customer engagement process different between customers that have Tableau and those that don\u2019t? Filip: One of the advantages of coming into a company equipped with Tableau is that there isn't really almost any setup needed so that I can connect to the internal systems. I need to get permissions. I need to tick a box on each view that I want to be consuming with Tableau, and that's it. And I can work. I can work with the full history, with the full, rich data set, and there is no other controls, changes that augment needed. Tableau: Can you speak a bit about your process for connecting Tableau to different SAP systems? Filip: So we usually have about two scenarios for connecting Tableau to SAP systems. The first one will be connecting to an SAP BW system, and that's very straight-forward. So any views that are present in an SAP BW system can be directly accessed through Tableau within five seconds or so. And the other scenario that we use is connecting to an SAP HANA instance. So sometimes we would export multiple data sources from our customers, load it into our own SAP HANA instance for the speed, and sometimes for some transformations. And then we would be connecting Tableau to our own SAP HANA instance. Our customers would usually be the top tier companies within their industries in my country. It would be 90 percent customers who have implemented SAP and who have some working relationship with us."

In this video, she talks about the positive changes they experienced after introducing Tableau: Tableau: What would your job be like without Tableau? Ryoko Minowa, Digital Development Division: Without Tableau, the stories we want to tell become clumsy and circumlocutory, and we cannot make decisions quickly. Tableau: How has Tableau changed things? Ms. Minowa: With Tableau, it is not only problems that we can make visible but the employees making efforts and working hard in the line. Tableau also reduced a great amount of our workload that we needed for reporting and aggregate calculations. We can now use that time to focus on analysis. These are the benefits of use of Tableau. Tableau: Tell us more about en-japan. Ms. Minowa: Our main business is to offer recruiting information and services after (an employee) begins with a company. Our business is to connect the company demanding talented people and the users who want to get a job using our job offer site. Tableau: What does your job involve? Ms. Minowa: We have been operating more than 10 sites for corporations and users, and I have been overseeing analysis about attracting customers. Tableau: Was there a particular problem you were facing? Ms. Minowa: We have various data sources such as SQL Server and Google Analytics, but there was the problem that we have to unify because each managers have been reporting from his or her own viewpoint. I had a mission to unify the disordered data. As I understood the result that could be had from Tableau\u2014which I used in former company\u2014I decided to introduce it. Tableau: What encouraged you and your organization to check out Tableau? Ms. Minowa: We have used SQL Server with other BI tools in daily routine duties every morning. And we spent several tens of minutes for it, but we are able to shorten to only several seconds. With Google Analytics, we are able to report on multiple accounts with the same format by making one kind of report. We are able to do fixed point observation efficiently guaranteeing quality without any human error. We are able to analyze the factors contributing to a problem and solve the problem effectively by using this. Because we know that when some problems happen in a specific site, we would have internal factor and when similar problems happen in plural sites, we would have external factors. Tableau: What\u2019s next for your company and Tableau? Ms. Minowa: After visualizing what we hadn't known before, I wanted to share it with many people. So I wanted to design an infrastructure that could make this possible. Therefore, I have been considering Tableau Server. Tableau: What\u2019s your impression of Tableau? Ms. Minowa: I think quick processing or making reports with a unified template are also probably possible with other BI tools. The biggest reason why I choose Tableau is visualization. I think that there is no meaning if we do not have it seen\u2014even if there is a lot of data and splendid discovery. We have to show it beautifully and definitely to have it seen. Tableau specializes in this. Tableau: What do you recommend to others considering Tableau? Ms. Minowa: As it can make wonderful reports and dashboards easily without any special and advanced skill in analysis and design, I would like to recommend (Tableau to) other people having similar problems."

Before Tableau, it could take weeks to gather data from different systems, pull it together, and share it with central administrations. When the business intelligence team at Katy ISD first adopted Tableau, they created dashboards to fit the needs of elementary, junior high, and high school principals. When they revealed the dashboards, questions starting flying. Principals could easily see and understand data from different systems, all in one place. Today, principals can create their own visualizations with Tableau Desktop and immediately gain insights into school operations. And with Tableau Server, they can find the latest data in \u201cliterally seconds.\u201d Tableau: What was the first reaction to Tableau at Katy Independent School District (Katy ISD)?\nJamey Hynds, Director of Business Intelligence: We had a set of principals, multiple principals from every level, high school, junior high, and elementary level. We built dashboards specifically based off of their requests, their requirements, and just kind of went down the path of letting them tell us what they wanted. Then at the end, when we met with them and showed them the dashboards that we had built specifically for them. The questions just started flying out. And I think the excitement was there. Tableau: Can you talk a little bit about the Tableau training sessions?\nJamey: Halfway through the training, we give the principals access to their own information and show them how to actually log into the portal. And once they did that, the only problem is with that, it's hard to reign them back in to go back into training because then they start taking off and really exploring their own information. Tableau: How does Tableau compare with your previous reporting solution?\nJamey: It would take days and sometimes weeks for the campuses to gather the information from all the different systems and then to pull it all together and to see it in the format that it needed to be submitted back to central administration. And we were able to do that in literally seconds with one of the new dashboards that we had. Tableau: So what was the goal with your dashboards?\nJamey: The goal is to, you know, provide somewhat of a self-service environment through our dashboards for people to be able to answer the questions that come up. Tableau: How has this affected your daily work?\nJamey: I'm just excited to kind of be a part of the whole process of being in analytics and using data to try to make a difference. Tableau: How do you handle governance at Katy ISD?\nJamey: Once they build the dashboards, if it's something that they feel like they need to distribute out to other people, then they'll bring it to us. We'll kind of cleanse it and make sure the security is at an enterprise level, and then distribute that through our portal. Tableau: So you\u2019re finding new ways to do data analysis?\nJamey: Yeah, the initiative was really to start using analytics in our schools. Up until now, we've just been textual and spreadsheet sort of environment. And we really wanted to change and start doing things a different way. We kind of set up a plan to build an analytics solution that would give first our administrators the ability to look at information, look at data in a different way, and to be able to drill into it."

        "company": "Oldcastle",
        "content": "Oldcastle is North America\u2019s leading manufacturer of building products and materials like masonry and hardscapes, also known as \u201csexy concrete.\u201d With 20 divisions and 206 facilities across Canada and the United States, Oldcastle first found success with Tableau by turning a 500-page monthly report into a governed, enterprise-wide accessible dashboard for their employees. Ian Crabtree, Chief Financial Officer of Oldcastle Masonry & Hardscapes, was initially skeptical of business intelligence solutions. But at Ian\u2019s behest, the company now touts more than 3000 dashboards and 1800 dashboard subscribers, tracking 78,000 SKUs. Oldcastle\u2019s business intelligence team leads the charge by working with IT to adequately provide governance and security and helping enable smart and rapid business decisions in their competitive industry. Ian Crabtree, Oldcastle\u2019s CFO of Masonry & Hardscapes, once appropriately equated the size of the company\u2019s monthly report as \u201cthe size of a paver you\u2019d put in your backyard.\u201d When Ian first hired Paul Lisborg, Manager of Business Intelligence at Oldcastle, he tasked his new employee to replace the 45-page PDF that arrived in people\u2019s inboxes every morning. It showed the most recent sales numbers by divisions, by business line, and by facility. But due to the static nature of PDFs, numbers were often outdated soon after publishing. With Tableau, Paul created a dashboard that provides a digestible overview of Oldcastle\u2019s 206 distinct manufacturing facilities and allows employees to ask follow-up questions. The dashboard is refreshed every night so the data stays fresh. It also has row-level security, meaning teams only see data they have permission to view. Once people realized they could ask their own questions of the data, the response was almost immediate. \u201cWe started getting phone calls: \u2018Can you add this filter?\u2019 \u2018I want to see the data in this fashion,\u201d says Paul. It was clear people wanted to see the data in their own ways. So Paul, with the help of several analysts, created a library of templates containing vetted data. Using web authoring, people can use these vizzes as a starting point for their own analysis and share their findings. \u201cWe can give them a data set with predefined measures and dimensions, and they can build their own intelligence through the web-authoring tool. And it\u2019s one single source of truth,\u201d says Paul. \u201cWhether a gentleman builds it in San Diego or a lady builds the same information in Chicago, they'll be getting the same answer, but at the same time, they can manipulate the data to their specific needs.\u201d The Oldcastle sales team spearheads an inventory of over 78,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs). It\u2019s imperative for the team to quickly and easily identify losses, track margins, and seize potential opportunities across their enterprise. But empowering a sales force in a scalable way proved difficult. Now, by pulling ERP and Salesforce data into Tableau, the sales team always has access to the full picture. \u201cNow a sales rep can come into a dashboard, look to what he sold yesterday, look to how he's doing this month, look how he's doing year to date. And then he's able to drill down into: What customers are doing well? What are those customers buying? What are my margins on those items?\u201d says Paul. Everyone from sales managers to individual sales representatives look to Tableau dashboards to track quotas on a daily and monthly basis. For a sales team, having access to insights from the vast quantities of customer data is empowering. \u201cNow, [a salesperson has] Tableau dashboards. They might not even be aware they\u2019re looking at a Tableau dashboard. But the information that they are receiving from that is much more powerful than having rows and columns of information,\u201d says Paul. As Oldcastle\u2019s CFO, Ian describes the role of finance as the \u201cheartbeat of a company.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s connected to sales, it\u2019s connected to logistics, procurement, production, marketing.\u201d When Ian first trialed Tableau, he knew that it would change the way that the company consumed data and he felt compelled to champion it across the business. \u201cVery quickly, I could see that that this was a disruptive technology that's going to take time to embrace, but once it becomes a fabric of the company, is going to change the way that we consume data.\u201d Today, in meetings and day-to-day work, Oldcastle\u2019s leadership team uses Tableau to see a 360-degree view of the business in real time. Ian can convey financial information in an easy-to-consume format, helping leaders make informed, data-driven decisions based on current data. \u201cA better CFO, for me, is being a true business partner to the business president,\u201d shares Ian. \u201cMy favorite part of my job is sitting at the leadership table and bringing insight to the management group and bringing it in real time\u2014proposing something to [improve operations.] \u201cIn my role in finance, especially with tools like Tableau, I can do that far quicker, cheaper, faster, and in so doing, I get a kick. I help the business be more successful.\u201d Oldcastle\u2019s 11 divisions share concrete molds on a national scale. One of Paul\u2019s first projects with Tableau was creating a mold-tracking visualization to give instant visibility into a mold\u2019s location for manufacturing productivity. Instead of creating a new mold for a manufacturing project, Oldcastle\u2019s sister companies can reference the dashboard to find the location of one nearby--saving resources and expediting manufacturing timelines. \u201c[The visualization] went from zero to 60 overnight,\u201d says Paul. \u201cWe have about 200 production people that are looking at it all at the same time.\u201d IT teams across organizations, including Oldcastle\u2019s, are the brain trust when it comes to keeping data secure. For Ian and Paul, it was incredibly important to collaborate on a workflow that would help propel fast business decisions for the organization at-large. \u201cWe have both SQL Servers and a Netezza data warehouse. They maintain the infrastructure, the security. And we work with them to produce the data models and dashboards,\u201d says Paul. Oldcastle pulls ERP data from its Netezza warehouse and creates a daily extract on Tableau Server. The company also pulls SQL tables from Salesforce and creates extracts to get quick insights into customer leads and opportunities. Across the enterprise, Oldcastle has more than 500 web authors and some 1,800 dashboard subscribers\u2014and growing. With IT providing proper governance, everyone, from division presidents to manufacturing workers, is empowered to uncover insights and make an impact. \u201cThis is a true culture of self-service analytics,\u201d says Ian."

To remain competitive the university established the Office of Institutional Research (IR). The IR team analyzes enormous amounts of data related to curriculum and administration for strengthening its management of the university. The university relied on Access and Excel to store and analyze data\u2014a time-consuming, manual process. The team needed a better solution that would allow various departments to visualize, and analyze their data quickly with less cost and effort. With Tableau, the university became capable of visualizing various data on the admissions processes and other factors including student\u2019s high school ratings and their performance after enrollment. They are using Tableau to visualize the data of Test of English for Academic Purposes (TEAP), a new admission process implemented in 2015, to effectively design their admission policy. The university shared the TEAP case study with the TEAP council. Now many other universities are interested in incorporating TEAP into their admissions policies. Now with Tableau, Sophia University is: Founded in 1913, the 102-year old Sophia University has been selected to be part of the Top Global University Project\u201d led by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in 2014. The project aims to boost the globalization of Japanese universities so that graduates can take leadership in the world. The year before Top Global University Project began, Sophia University established an Institutional Research (IR) team to analyze enormous amounts of university data. Originally, they analyzed data in Access and Excel\u2014a manual and time-consuming process. Communication of data across departments also needed to be improved. Yoshiharu Aioi, ICT Office, Bureau of Academic Research and Information says, \u201cWe could not utilize information gathered from all departments like admissions, education, career support, finance and corporate planning. We had to look for a more sufficient BI tool to make the right decisions based on data.\u201d While Mr. Aioi was looking for a BI solution, he learned that Shimane University implemented Tableau. When he trialed Tableau Desktop to analyze admissions data, he was stunned with its simplicity and powerful visualization capability. With the Top Global University Project subsidy, the University was able to purchase a license for Tableau Desktop and it has opened a new door of big data analysis for the University. He explains, \u201cFirst, I made instructions and organized a fundamentals training session with 15 members from different departments.\u201d The university set up a new project to introduce Tableau to many other employees with an original textbook and with Mr. Aioi as the Tableau champion. Now, anyone who has problems can see him for further questions and other project members help each other learn Tableau. Alongside Shimane University, Sophia University is one of the first universities that have implemented Tableau in Japan. Many Sophia University staff members have become intrigued by the analytics software\u2019s user-friendly interface and powerful visualization. Tableau helped the university design their admissions policy, according to Professor Takashi Irohara of Admissions Office. \u201cThere are more than 10 different kinds of admissions at our university. With Tableau we found the relationships between the admissions processes and other factors including student\u2019s high school rating and their performance after enrollment. Visualized data is utilized for making decision on the admission policy. By combining with the data of the Test of English for Academic Purposes (TEAP), we were able to visualize applicants\u2019 English ability in the university.\u201d After sharing the new TEAP admission data analysis by Tableau, departments throughout the university became inspired and engaged with the data. Ever since then, the number of data requests from them has increased. Furthermore, the University shared the TEAP case study with the TEAP council. Sophia has made a new trend in college admissions policy and now many other universities are interested in incorporating TEAP into their admissions policies."

        "content": "Merkle is a global, data-driven marketing agency that frequently partners with Fortune 1000 companies. With a keen focus on data and technology, Merkle needed a flexible business intelligence tool that was up to their high standard. Today, Merkle uses Tableau to showcase data to customers\u2014framing analyses as storytelling experiences. In this video, Amanda Gessert, Senior Manager of Business Intelligence shares how she uses Story Points in presentations. Interactive visualizations allow customers to ask questions, drill down, and get answers immediately. When asked about data storytelling, Amanda comments with a smile, \u201cdata is nothing without the people.\u201d Tableau: You have a real focus on Storytelling at Merkle, don\u2019t you? Amanda Gessert, Senior Manager, Business Intelligence: I think data storytelling is hugely valuable. I think that data, while we like to think it can stand on its own, it can't. Data is nothing without the people involved with it. Tableau: What's your position at Merkle? Amanda: I'm a senior manager of business intelligence. So, basically, I help customers understand how to make their business intelligence more effective. Tableau: What does that look like, practically speaking? Amanda: So whether that's helping them to identify good tools, or whether that's helping them figure out how to take their visualizations and kind of bring them up to the next level, tell stories with this visualizations or, you know, help them to get the data in place on the back end to support the type of analytics that they're most interested in doing. Tableau: How does Tableau fit into that? Amanda: When you're working with a tool like Tableau, you have a lot of different ways to approach the same situation. And it's so easy to flip between those ways that you don't feel as cemented into doing things the way that it's been done before. Tableau: What's your favorite thing about Tableau? Amanda: I love the flexibility of the tool. I love that if you can dream it, there's probably a way to do it. And I love that it almost challenges you to find new ways to do things, or better, more effective ways to do things. Tableau: How do you use Tableau with your customer data? Amanda: My experience, a lot of it, has been working with clients to help them discover different ways to take their current analyses, frame them in more of a narrative, persuasive form, and Story Points is a great way to do that. It gives you the opportunity to, similar to PowerPoint, segment your presentation, but still allows you the flexibility and the interactivity of Tableau to be able to, on the fly, change what it is that you're doing, drill down a little bit deeper, or even dig into the underlying data to answer an unanticipated question. Tableau: How do your customers react to that? Amanda: What's interesting is if I show them data in Story Points and don't tell them that we're showing them their data in Story Points, and as far as they're concerned, it's PowerPoint. And then all of a sudden I drill down or I do a filter or I do something like that, their mind is blown and they think it's fantastic. Tableau: What are the benefits of using Story Points? Amanda: That person who's interpreting that story is also sometimes that person who is interacting with the data and who is starting to figure out exactly what it is that's going on with whatever problem it is they're trying to solve. And so, as a result, having something like Story Points really enables them to be able to leverage their data, tell that story they were already going to tell, but to do it in a more flexible, interactive way. Tableau: What would you do if you didn't have Tableau? Amanda: If I didn't have Tableau, I would, I would probably cry. I would be so sad. Because it does, it just makes me happy every day to come into work and to spend time working in it. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted your career? Amanda: Tableau has hugely impacted my career. What's so funny is prior to working with Tableau the first time, I knew I loved data. And I knew I loved working with people. And it always felt like there was something missing in the middle. I had this skill that I knew a lot of people didn't have, kind of being able to communicate about data and also having that analytic skill set, but I think I was missing was that medium, that tool set to be able to really leverage my skills in a way that was going to benefit my career. Tableau: And that\u2019s where Tableau came in? Amanda: And that's where Tableau fit in. It allowed me to start working with data and working with people to help them understand their data. And, you know, between working with people to train them on the tool to working with people to train them on visualization best practices and how they should be creating dashboards more effectively, it's totally changed the trajectory of my career. Tableau: Are you actively involved in the Tableau community, like Tableau User Groups, for example? Amanda: I love the Tableau User Groups. In fact, we even have one we kind of unofficially host at Merkle. Just monthly meetings where all of our Tableau users, we get together and we talk about exactly what we're working on, different tips and tricks that might be helpful to others, bizarre use cases that might be useful. Tableau: What benefits have you experienced from your User Group? Amanda: It just provides a good place to meet face to face with people and to have conversations that might be more difficult to do over the phone or over e-mail with somebody who actually works at Tableau. You can have conversations about different ways that you might implement your server or better ways you might implement your server. And you can have conversations about kind of weird problems that you might be having and get a whole troop of people surrounded around a laptop to kind of talk through different issues."

        "content": "Mr. Tomoyuki Okawa, General Manager in Business Analysis Department, Corporate Planning says that Tableau enabled DARTSLIVE to work more efficiently, analyzing data from deeper perspectives\u2014in a shorter amount of time. Mr. Okawa also describes how Tableau helps them analyze millions of records of data sent from the machines everyday, delivering insight to improve their business. Tableau: Tell us more about DARTSLIVE. Mr. Tomoyuki Okawa, General Manager, Business Analysis Department, Corporate Planning Division: DARTSLIVE performs planning, manufacturing, and sales for online dart machines, and places them at a number of shops and dart bars. We also perform business by focusing on darts such as event planning and conducting, and management for dart bars, etc. Tableau: What kinds of data do you work with? Mr. Okawa: Millions of play results in dart games are coming in per day. We utilize Tableau by storing the data as raw data, and aggregating and re-using it by using the data warehouse for easy analysis, then, putting it in Tableau. The data is stored in the relational database, and a data warehouse is used in order to analyze the data. One of them, Yahoo! Big Data Insight, is used to store service data, sales data, and the related promotion data, etc. Then, the multiple data are divided from there and re-combined on Tableau with the data placed in a columnar-type database. Tableau: Was there a particular problem you were facing? Mr. Okawa: Absolutely, the files collecting the data were scattered around, and it was totally difficult to pull them together. Therefore, we try to solve the problems by using Tableau Cloud at the same time in order to collect the files of Tableau in one place. Tableau: What are the most important benefits of Tableau Cloud? Mr. Okawa: One of the major reasons for adopting Tableau Cloud is that the server and the infrastructure are provided without our preparation. I was also very attracted to being able to start from one license. Since it is easy to start it without significant costs, promoting this introduction is a big benefit now by decreasing the personnel cost in the infrastructure area and the in-house cost. Tableau: How has Tableau changed things? Mr. Okawa: Obtaining the data and reporting by using the data were as costly in time as a half day, and even one or two days if it's longer. However, because Tableau enables the one-stop access, it sometime takes only a few hours or less than one hour at the fastest to complete reporting. Therefore, the staff can work by looking deeply and multi-faced analysis in the data more efficiently by shortening working time as well as performing the work smoothly. Tableau: What roles? Mr. Okawa: We are currently in the stage of promotion to utilize it at the business department with emphasis on the marketing department. Our Development team is trying to perform A/B tests in order to see what new functions they have to create at the actual development site, and the Promotion team is trying to practice self-service BI using Tableau to evaluate the effects of their promotion activities as a part of so called PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle. Tableau: How would you sum up the effect of Tableau on your company? Mr. Okawa: Communications between our staffs were improved because we can use data to tell information in an easy-to-understand way, and it was the first benefit that we experienced after introducing Tableau. The great part of using Tableau is that each staff started being interested in data or having a data mind after they learned how to analyze data by themselves using Tableau. They started realizing that each of them should work on focusing how to utilize the data, as well as how to reduce the hassles to create the actual data effectively. I think that we can now obtain effective results by having the targeted predicated data and numbers without the unclear past experiences for our future business, our planning measures, and event planning or development. Tableau: What would your job be like without Tableau? Mr. Okawa: Well, if we do not have Tableau, we will keep the same work as last year and the year before. Tableau: What has been your impression of Tableau so far? Mr. Okawa: Because I can find ways to be able to perform, and how to practice and observe the data by using Tableau, I hope that it will very much become a step-up tool for my business performance and management."

        "company": "Bronto Skylift",
        "content": "This international market leader in aerial platforms for firefighting, rescue, and industrial applications needed a data rescue. Bronto Skylift was relying making decisions based on data that could be outdated or unreliable. Data lived in different systems, including an ERP system and spreadsheets. Compiling data from these various sources took too long and was resource-intensive. Worse, it could result in multiple versions of the truth. Bronto worked with the Finnish technology consultants Solutive to deploy Tableau to understand their data more clearly. Bronto now has one common, visually compelling approach for reporting sales, manufacturing, finance, and other important key performance indicators. When a fire breaks out 100 meters above the ground, emergency services providers call for a Bronto Skylift hydraulic platform. Finnish company Bronto Skylift is a global market leader in vehicle-mounted, aerial platforms for firefighting, rescue, and industrial applications. The company produces a range of appliances that extend up to 112 meters in working height. Bronto Skylift has net sales of $132 million (2015) and operates subsidiaries in Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.S. Bronto was experiencing a common challenge: the need to make reporting easier to produce, share, and understand. The company stored data across a number of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, including an IFS finance system; Lean System ERP platform from Tieto; a staff time reporting system; and other sources. This was a time-consuming, labor-intensive process that delayed decision making. Many other ad hoc, day-to-day business decisions were based on data sitting in spreadsheets, separate to the ERP system. The result? Different sources of the truth and decisions based on old and sometimes untrusted data. For example, reporting was typically completed on a monthly basis, so decisions about sales, manufacturing or service were often based on data up to 30 days old. As a stock-listed company, it was crucial to develop a forecasting process that would be faster and more reliable. \u201cIn the past, manufacturing production forecasts were produced manually,\u201d says Kimmo P\u00e4rssinen, Chief Financial Officer at Bronto Skylift. \u201cWe used to pull together data from manufacturing, customer requests for delivery, and invoicing schedules. It took one person a whole day each week to prepare the spreadsheet.\u201d These were just a couple of the situations P\u00e4rssinen was appointed to resolve. \u201cReports were developed for a single purpose,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhenever senior management needed to understand the manufacturing order backlog, for example, a spreadsheet would be prepared from the sales data. That report took a considerable amount of effort to produce\u2014and sometimes a considerable amount of effort to understand. We were missing a process-based way of thinking.\u201d And this challenge extended across the Bronto organization. For example, it was difficult to understand the specific situation in geographic regions. \u201cEverything from sales orders, invoicing and accounts payable, to production schedules, regional sales performance, and working capital management emanated from the same manual process. I sometimes felt you needed a Bronto crane just to lift all these spreadsheets.\u201d The Finnish manufacturer turned to Tableau. Working closely with a leading Finnish partner Solutive, Bronto has deployed Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server to see and understand data more clearly. P\u00e4rssinen again, \u201cWhen it comes to Tableau knowledge, practical experience and insight, Solutive are the masters. They have been great partners to work with throughout this deployment. It\u2019s thanks to the tight collaboration with the Solutive team that we have managed to achieve so much with this business intelligence strategy so quickly.\u201d A three-person core team in P\u00e4rssinen\u2019s IT department and finance create the visual analytics reports, working closely with the management team and sales managers to ensure the reporting is aligned with the business requirements. According to P\u00e4rssinen, this change in reporting has been transformational. \u201cUsing Tableau, our reporting has moved from the Stone Age into a stellar new age of fast, interactive reporting,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe now have one common, visually compelling approach for reporting sales, manufacturing, finance, and other important key performance indicators. And thanks to the visual-based reports, the answers are there for everyone to see. For example, if we look at production reports, we can drill down through the data to examine cost differences between work phases, discover delays or changes to production schedules, and determine delivery reliability. This was only possible in the past if we poured vast amounts of resources into the reporting.\u201d Tableau also answers the call for faster forecasting. Instead of taking a full day per week, \u201cNow, we simply use Tableau to distribute the data as a PDF\u2014and it only takes an hour,\u201d says P\u00e4rssinen. This success is indicative of the company\u2019s move to real-time reporting. Where before reporting was typically based on data up to 30 days old, now the sales figures are updated every two hours. That means decisions made looking at the Tableau visual analytics are based on data never more than two hours old. \u201cIt\u2019s as near real-time as we need,\u201d P\u00e4rssinen explains. The reporting is not only faster, it\u2019s more reliable too. For example, forward-looking manufacturing forecasts used to deviate by up to 20%, simply because these forecasts relied on out-of-date data, or the latest delivery schedules hadn\u2019t been integrated. Now these forecasts deviate by only a tiny fraction, reducing costs across the business\u2014from inventory and supply chain costs, to labor and capital equipment costs. The Tableau mapping feature has also streamlined and accelerated decision making. P\u00e4rssinen continues, \u201cFor the first time, we can click on a country and tap into a wealth of information about that region. In a few seconds, we can see how many units are sold in that country, the status of the receivables, where the customers are located and where the trucks are delivered to. We can even click on an individual truck and determine the after-sales service situation.\u201d P\u00e4rssinen and his team are so committed to Tableau, they have embarked on a \u2018kill list\u2019: eliminating unnecessary databases and spreadsheets that contain poor quality, out-of-date data. \u201cIf people have access to these sources of information, there is a danger they will incorporate the data into their reporting,\u201d he says. The company is close to replacing all PowerPoint charts and tables with Tableau content, for example, and Tableau is steadily becoming the standard reporting mechanism in the boardroom. P\u00e4rssinen adds, \u201cThe Board used to contact me and say, \u2018Do you have that sales report ready yet?\u2019 Now I just send them the link.\u201d"

Using their proprietary technology, the company specializes in helping customers with targeted advertising programs for mobile devices. Vpon\u2019s mobile advertising platform is growing rapidly, with over 450 million unique devices in Asia. The company\u2019s client base includes over 1,500 renowned brands like Citibank, Coca-Cola, and McDonald's. Currently Vpon operates in over 750 cities across mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. Vpon recently deployed Tableau, allowing the team to significantly quicken speed to insights, especially when working with large datasets. With Tableau, the team is also able to visually present their analysis and allow end users to interact with the information and find answers to their own questions. Meiyen Chen, PhD, is a senior data scientist at Vpon. Meiyen and her team and engineers work with more than 1 billion rows of data every day. In addition to a large amount of raw data stored in JSON format in Hadoop, her team looks at data stored in Google Analytics, Microsoft SQL Server, and more. \u201cWe found that it required a long time whenever we needed to produce a quarterly report that required us to query three months\u2019 worth of data directly from our Hadoop system,\u201d Dr. Chen explained. \u201cThe team actually aggregated and extracted part of the data, those that users commonly access for key metrics, in a Teradata data warehouse to quicken the process,\u201d she added. Also, they found additional challenges when presenting the reports to end users. She said, \u201cWe would place the analytical findings in Excel spreadsheets and send them across to end users. The problem was that end users would not be able to extract information from external datasets for comparison when they are accessing information in the spreadsheets. They would often come back to my team to clarify certain parts or make additional requests.\u201d Furthermore, some end users needed access to updated data insights while outside of the office. They were frustrated with trying to review Excel spreadsheets from a phone or tablet computer. This process of extracting and analyzing the data, generating the reports and working with end users to resolve issues could easily take up to six weeks, according to Dr. Chen. The team would receive more than 10 request tickets asking for ad hoc data queries each week. Dr. Chen and her team set out to find a tool that could help enhance productivity. They tested several data analytics and visualization tools before deciding on Tableau. \u201cExcept for Tableau, the other analytics tools require us to do quite a bit of coding or recoding, especially if we need interactive elements, and we did not want to invest too much time into programming,\u201d she further commented. \u201cWe also wanted a tool that provides varying application program interfaces (API) that allow us to connect to multiple data sources,\u201d she added. The team was pleased to see that Tableau offered a number of APIs. Additionally, Dr. Chen\u2019s team wanted to deliver visual analytics to their end users. \u201cEnd users can better make use of the information with data visualization. Tableau came across as a natural choice,\u201d she also said. Currently, Dr. Chen\u2019s team use Tableau Desktop to analyze data and create reports or visualizations using the software. Staff from business units like account servicing, finance, and business development situated across Taiwan access the reports to gain insights for their work. For instance, the account servicing team manages campaign operation data using Tableau and the business development team uses the software to visualize inventory data for display advertisement. Tableau adoption has gone so smoothly in Taiwan that Dr. Chen plans to have her team extend their services to business units at Vpon offices in Hong Kong, China and Japan by end of the year. Dr Chen commented: \u201cTableau has shortened our time to insights tremendously. We are able to aggregate the frequently asked questions into the Tableau dashboards so users can easily go to them and find their own answers. Our analysts can also synchronize their progress, update data automatically, and evaluate their own findings with the same dashboards. This has reduced the number of request tickets to the team by 80 percent, leaving us with more time for product development and other value-added services.\u201d \u201cOur engineers also found that we now get about 120 times improvement in time saving using Tableau compared to querying data directly from Hadoop, which we often need to do, like when they are working on the quarterly reports,\u201d she added. Many of the end users at Vpon also access the Tableau dashboards using mobile devices such as tablets. This allows them to conveniently look up important information, even when on the road. The team\u2019s data management platform has inspired a positive transformation in how staff at Vpon are leveraging and thinking about data. Dr. Chen is also looking forward to turning the internal success into product prototypes that may deliver similar benefits for Vpon clients. Lastly, she shared that she plans to join a Tableau user group to share knowledge and learn about best practices from other users. \u201cThere are many big data communities out there where people get together to discuss algorithm, data infrastructure, or programming language for analyzing data, but a Tableau group would be different as the focus is on conveying data visually to the audience,\u201d she concluded."

In this video, Richard Langlois, Enterprise Data Management Director speaks about his experience running Tableau and AtScale on top of Hadoop. Today, the team can analyze big data 10 to 20 times faster leading to better, faster decision making. Tableau: How big is the database that you\u2019re working with? Richard Langlois, Enterprise Data Management Director: The size of the database we're using, one table we have 57 billion rows. This is only for 25 months of data. So we do a rolling 25. So if you want to do all that on Hadoop\u2014even if you have something like Hadoop\u2014it's fast, but it might not be fast enough. Tableau: Can you talk about your experience with AtScale and Tableau? Richard: Actually, to connect Tableau to AtScale, it's like connecting to any other sources. And Tableau is quite good at connecting to a lot of different sources. And the job of that AtScale is to intercept the query that Tableau does, create, aggregate behind the scene, and rewrite the SQL that Tableau generates so that the user will never know. Now, but when you're trying to do analysis and you don't want to slow people's line of thought, right? They have something they're trying to solve. So if they can have an answer back much faster it's great. Tableau: How much time have you saved? Richard: And when we did that, we got anything from 10 to about 20 times faster. So on Hadoop, Impala\u2014that's the recipe\u201410 to 20 times faster using AtScale. So Tableau now just runs super fast on our implementation. Everybody is faster with that one. So by adding the AtScale pieces to it, the aggregates could give you a 10 times\u2019 improvement. So that's the point\u2014you're getting ten times faster, so the two minutes, one actually. In fact, it's even more. And so it's extremely responsive and we have been doing a couple of events because we're so happy with the result. Tableau: Can you tell us about your Tableau deployment? Richard: We're playing with different types of Tableau licenses. We have Tableau Cloud, we have Tableau Desktop, and we have Tableau Server. So we're working on the Server side for our on-premise Hadoop implementation. That's one of the thing we do...So for stuff that marketing produces, they produce an extract, put it (in) Online, and then the users can connect to it."

        "company": "Progressive Insurance",
        "content": "Progressive is one of the largest providers of car insurance in the United States. The company uses data in all areas of the company, from quotes and claims, to analyzing driver behavior. In video 1, Brian Durkin, Innovation Strategist, shares how Progressive chose Tableau over traditional tools, because it allows for rapid testing on large quantities of data stored in Excel, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Hortonworks Hadoop. With Tableau\u2019s native data connectors, the data science team can bring all of this data into one view. In video 2, Brian talks about Progressive\u2019s Snapshot\u00ae program, which allows drivers to save money through safe driving behavior. The data science team uses Tableau to analyze Snapshot data along with external sources\u2014helping Progressive understand how different conditions affect driving patterns. Tableau: How would you describe Progressive? Brian Durkin, Innovation Strategist: We're a data-driven company. So all of our leaders, our senior leaders, and all our analysts, and everybody in the company, really, they want to use data to inform their decisions. And so we've been, traditionally, a very hands-on type of company where people are using the Desktop version. Tableau: Who views Tableau dashboards at Progressive? Brian: Tableau is used pretty much across the board within Progressive. Our customers are everybody from our individual internal analysts up through our senior leaders that use the reports, and they use Tableau itself in order to analyze the data. So it's pretty widespread across the company. Tableau: How exactly do you work with data? And what types of sources of data do you have? Brian: Our marketing department will bring in data, we'll compare that against data from our policy servicing department. We'll also look at claims, we'll look at quotes, we'll look at all these different areas to mash up data. We use Tableau to do a lot of that. The technology used to store these things is also pretty diverse. So there's a lot of Excel, there's a lot of SQL Server, there's Oracle, a lot of DB2, and then all the new big data stuff. We store a lot of data in [Hortonworks] Hadoop. And Tableau, with all the connectors that it has, allows us to bring this data together and look at it in new different ways. Tableau: What\u2019s something Tableau makes possible or easier? Brian: Sometimes when you're using Hadoop to do data exploration, your datasets can be so extremely large that you need new tools in order to really analyze that data effectively. So we use Tableau and do subset sampling to do data exploration. A lot of times, we'll use it to analyze the aggregate data. But it provides us a way to rapidly test data and look for new things. With some of our traditional tools, it takes a little bit of work to set up your data analyses and figure out really what you're looking for there. Tableau allows us to rapidly iterate over that and do this rapid hypothesis testing to look for new things. And that's important when you're dealing with these really large datasets. You need to be able to change your views and the way you're analyzing it pretty quickly. Tableau allows us to do that. Tableau: What\u2019s the main value of using Tableau? Brian: I think it's somewhat hard to quantify the savings or the value that Tableau brings. A lot of times there's things we couldn't even do previously, using our legacy tool set. Tableau allows us to do these things now. And so comparing what you couldn't do at all to what is possible now, it's huge. It's night and day. Tableau: How has Tableau changed the way you analyze data? Brian: Being able to have the technology to analyze data, to fiddle with the data, to experiment with it, to play with it and just look at it in different ways has been amazing. A lot of our traditional tools don't allow us to do this rapid experimentation and exploration. Tableau's a great tool that allows you to do that, just to see what you have and analyze it, and figure out what you can do with it. Tableau: How important is data to Progressive? Brian: At Progressive, our company is built on data. That's our product. So we don't build widgets or cars or anything. Data is what we do. And so we're a data-centric company through and through. So finding the best data tools and technology to really leverage our key asset, what we have, anything there gives us a huge advantage. Tableau: What is Snapshot? Brian: Snapshot is a program at Progressive that allows our drivers to prove that they're safe drivers, and they can save money when they do it. Tableau: How do you analyze Snapshot data? Brian: Our data science team that's responsible for the new scoring algorithms and Snapshot is always looking for the next big thing, the next thing that they can use to score driving behavior. So they bring in all sorts of different external datasets, external to our company\u2014weather, traffic, and even datasets within different parts of our organization\u2014and join those up and look at them in new and interesting ways to see what shakes out of it. They don't always know what they're looking for in the first place. They want to improve our models and make things better. But sometimes there's the surprises when you just join this data and you start to do these data exploration experiments. And Tableau and some of our big data systems really allow us to do that rapid hypothesis testing, trying out new ideas and just look what shakes out of the data.

Before Tableau, Grupo Gente queried cubes to surface information. They found that the process wasn\u2019t user-friendly enough to roll out to the entire organization as a business intelligence solution. Grupo Gente wanted to empower people across the company\u2014the ones who needed answers\u2014to dig into the data themselves. In this video, Head of Technology, Data Warehouse Development and Implementation at Beto Te Presta, Cynthia Bola\u00f1os and Regional BI Manager, Amanda Urbina explain how Tableau led to faster decision-making, allowing people from all areas of the company to analyze data. (Video in Spanish) Tableau: What led you to Tableau? Cynthia Bola\u00f1os, Head of Technology Data Warehouse Development and Implementation: What made us try out Tableau was the ease with which users could implement it and become self-sufficient in terms of generating reports to make decision-making easier. Tableau: What kind of impact has Tableau made so far? Amanda Urbina, Regional BI Manager: When it comes to making decisions, by far the biggest impact we have witnessed is the empowerment given to the user\u2014to the analyst\u2014in terms of decision-making, and empowerment. Tableau: How\u2019s using Tableau for you? Cynthia: The number of people who use Tableau in terms of creation are non-tech savvy end-users, while these users are... the tool is so user-friendly that people can use it easily without the need for any tech support for the development of their own reports. The positions involved are users such as business managers in general management, directors, risk managers, trade managers, sales managers\u2014all kinds of different areas. Tableau: What was life like before Tableau? Amanda: Before we implemented Tableau in our organization, all the analysis was done using cubes. Now with Tableau, building up a dashboard, compiling data, analysis, viewing data\u2014everything is much quicker than it used to be. Cynthia: If we didn't have Tableau, we would have to compile reports using other, less user-friendly tools. Users would have to spend more time building reports, using less user-friendly tools. Tableau: How are you planning to move forward with Tableau? Cynthia: The next step for our company and Tableau is to grow in terms of users. Growing the use of the tool so that more users become more self-sufficient in building up their own dashboards and taking business decisions. Amanda: It gives us the ability to be able to interpret and explore data\u2014this huge volume of data we deal with\u2014assisting us in making decisions which gives us a competitive advantage in our business, within our industry. Tableau: What kinds of issues were you facing before Tableau? Amanda: Before implementing Tableau, one of the main issues we had were the end users. Making them comfortable generating, compiling, and at the same time processing information and analyzing information. This issue is now much smaller thanks to the ease of use, the user-friendliness of Tableau in our organization. Once we implemented Tableau, user involvement became much quicker than it was previously."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Kaho Musen runs a home center chain called \"Home Center GooDay\" with 63 stores mainly in northern Kyushu, Japan. The company\u2019s Executive Vice President, Mr. Takashi Yanase, wanted his teams to use the company\u2019s point of sale (POS) data to guide better decisions. From hypothesis testing to identifying issues and communicating with branch managers, Mr. Yanase knew better access to data was crucial. But using Excel to analyze such huge quantities of data was nearly impossible, and writing custom code took up to 3 weeks. After trying several different business intelligence technologies, the team decided on a solution of Tableau on top of AWS. Employees across Systems, Project Management, and buyers in the Sales department all use Tableau to quickly query up to 160GB of data. Employees use Tableau Desktop to author visual analyses, then publish to Tableau Server where others can access and interact with published visualizations. Today, Mr. Yanase estimates that analysis takes \u201c1/100th\u201d the time it took before\u2014and the company is enjoying a renewed commitment to informing decisions with data. Tableau: What does your job involve?\nTakashi Yanase, Executive Vice President: I am a vice president of a retailer of home improvement products called GooDay that has 63 branches mostly in north Kyushu area. My main job is to analyze data and that is on sales and expenses. Tableau: Was there a particular problem you were facing?\nMr. Yanase: Since we are in retail, we had a lot of point of sale (POS) data, but we were not able to utilize it. We wanted to somehow be able to use the data for analysis. Tableau: How has Tableau changed things?\nMr. Yanase: The time it takes for us to get an insight is significantly shortened. I used to use Excel for all this and it took forever to complete my tasks, but it feels like the time shrank to about one hundredth by using Tableau. Tableau: What does Tableau allow you to do?\nMr. Yanase: It's been a challenge for me to share the figures with branch managers whenever I visit our store. However, by showing them the graphs and the figures through this tool, the communication has become much smoother. And now, since we can tell where the problems are, we are able to take appropriate measures for them. Before, we weren't able to effectively utilize the data as the data was just too big. However, Tableau lets us clarify our target and allows us to visually analyze it, so the analysis takes much less time and our hypothesis testing in the stores is much, much easier now to perform. It used to take me about 2 to 3 weeks to write a program, but by using Tableau's Business Dashboard, it now takes me only few minutes to create a report, and it is much easier to perform daily analyses. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted you personally?\nMr. Yanase: It actually motivated me to proceed with my work based on data. Our new management policy is to gather data that we didn't before and to analyze them using Tableau. I believe that was the biggest change that this tool has brought us. Tableau: What encouraged you and your organization to check out Tableau?\nMr. Yanase: We started trying out different tools after receiving a suggestion from our System department to review the data analysis methods within the company. Among all of the tools we've tried, we felt that Tableau was the easiest to use and it took the least time to complete tasks...and so this is what we currently use. It is mainly the System department and Project Management department that use this. Buyers in the Sales department also use this. Tableau: Tell us more about your data sources and storage.\nMr. Yanase: We now use the POS data from the register and \"blend\" the product data and the information from our suppliers. We used to use the local database by Oracle, but recently we use services by AWS. We handle about 160GB of data in terms of size. Tableau: What are the most important benefits for you from Tableau Server?\nMr. Yanase: What's convenient about Tableau Server is that it creates a workflow where a well-informed person can prepare a graph on his own Tableau Desktop and share it with others via the Server with a few simple steps, and this makes everything extremely easier. Tableau: What\u2019s next for your company and Tableau?\nMr. Yanase: We want to increase the number of people who can analyze data through Tableau, and train more people with data-driven mindset."

Before Tableau, Business Analyst Gert-Jan Neeft remembers working with data in Microsoft Excel and Access. The process was time-consuming and the end-results weren\u2019t pleasing to Peter Appel Transport's business analysts or customers. With Tableau, data is now enjoyable and easy\u2014so easy that Gert-Jan was able to make his first business report on just his second day using the software. In this video, Gert-Jan discusses how data analysis is now faster, more efficient, and more enjoyable thanks to self-service analytics. (Video in Dutch) Tableau: What has been the best part of using Tableau so far? Gert-Jan Neeft, Business Analyst: If you have a question you ask it and the nice thing is that it is used in all time zones, so when I\u2019m lying in bed, the answer is, just say, being written. And the next morning I can go further with my question or with the challenge that I have. And that is simply fantastic. Tableau: What led you to Tableau? Gert-Jan: Our attention was actually drawn to QlickView by our accountant. We had a demo of it, but I myself found it quite complicated and not very intuitive for being able to do something with one or two data sets. I then went to the best known search engine, Google, and very quickly hit upon Tableau. I had never heard of it, but I could have a 14-day free download. I did that very quickly and I actually went to work without anything\u2013without training, without people that I knew. I was simply playing with it in the evenings. Tableau: Did you find Tableau to be user-friendly? Gert-Jan: Without ever having seen or used the tool, I had actually made my first report on the second evening. That's what made me very excited. I thought, yes, this is it. And then we really stopped the whole selection procedure. I went to my director, Peter Appel and told him we need this. And I must have a license and we must set to work. And that is like our philosophy: just do! And he said, yes, you are a specialist in this field and if you say that we need this then we need this and then we shall do it. Tableau: How has Tableau changed your job? Gert-Jan: I was working a lot with data and did it with Excel, Access, with all kinds of tools. And with Tableau, life became only more enjoyable and it is much faster, it is much easier, you can do a lot more with it, you can share much more easily with people, give access, authorize. The whole concept is really what I would like to have as a BI specialist within Peter Appel transport, yes it is available with the package. I receive data sets from customers, you read them in, and you can get to work. I can simply get to work myself. That makes life a great deal simpler and more enjoyable. I no longer have to wait for other people. I no longer have questions for other people because I can simply do it myself. And with the dashboards that I have made, I can very quickly give access to the right people within the organization. They can start working with the data. They sometimes come back with questions, such as, \"I would also like this, I would also like that.\" We go and sit with it for half an hour and it is drag and drop, \u201csleur en pleur\u201d in Dutch, and that makes me happy. Tableau: Have you found the Tableau community to be helpful? Gert-Jan: The community is so large, so you learn very easily very quickly each day. And as a result your dashboards become only better, even more beautiful, even quicker. I say, it is really a kind of a drug, actually. It is really a kind of an addiction. You only want it and you only want more. You only want to go faster. You will want to get everything out of the tool that you can. And I have now landed a little bit in that phase. I follow a lot of blogs and YouTube channels. I read, watch, save, and start working with everything that I can find about Tableau. Tableau: How has Tableau helped you accomplish your data goals? Gert-Jan: If I look at myself, I would be very busy preparing a report and that really provided a single insight and that was it. And sometimes a week\u2019s data came along and you refreshed it and that was that. But you want to go further, you really want to give it to the user, so that they can start working very interactively with that data. And can actually further increase their understanding. That is actually what I have managed to achieve with Tableau."

But time-sensitive decisions were delayed by out-of-date analytical tools based on pivot tables and Excel sheets, with no visualization capabilities. In this video, Chris Gildea, VP of Sales, North America talks about how now, with Tableau Cloud, he can consult his dashboards in meetings, and find answers to business questions within 30 seconds. This has inspired a new interest in gathering quality data from distribution channels, customers, supply chain, and finance. Today, the sales teams access Tableau Cloud dashboards on mobile devices, where they can answer sales and product questions and identify trends. As more departments adopt Tableau Cloud, Chris is confident that \u201ceverybody's going to be using it one day, we plan on that for sure.\u201d Tableau: How has Tableau Cloud changed your daily work at Wheaton? Chris Gildea, VP of Sales, North America: This is the first time in my career over the past two years, where I can snap my fingers on a dashboard and determine what it is I need to know within 30 seconds. In the past, I'd have to go to the literature, I'd have to research it for a week. I'd have to say something out loud as an opinion in a meeting and then go find the data to prove it. Now, with Tableau, I can find that information before I even leave the meeting room. So I can make a justifiable business decision before I get out of the chair. And everybody in the entire board organization will say, \"Let's go with that.\" Because you have the data to prove it. I didn't have to go research it. And it increases the speed at which we can do business. Tableau: How does your scientific background contribute to your work with Tableau? Chris: As scientists, we want to find the result that is the most truthful result that we can tease out of the experiment. On the business side, it's the same thing. So we put our life science world together with our business world and we can answer questions for our customers and for ourselves using the Tableau environment. Tableau: How did you do data analysis before Tableau? Chris: When I started at Wheaton, we were using spreadsheets for the most part. A lot of very large pivot tables. And data was not a culture at Wheaton. We had a lot of opportunity to look at the data that we were collecting from our distribution channels as well as from our customers, and even some of our supply chain metrics and financial metrics and said, \"How do we take all of this and put it in one little, compact bucket that we can look at from a senior executive standpoint as well as a field sales associate or marketing?\" And when we decided to move forward with Tableau, which is something that our sales and commercial organization decided to do, it was like a breath of fresh air. We could see our data, we could visualize things happening on maps and find trends in our data as well. Tableau: Why did you choose Tableau Cloud? Chris: When we looked at [Tableau] Online, it was an easy choice. We had the ability to upload some basic data sets and manipulate them, make them what we wanted them to be, and then publish it to the world and then get immediate feedback. Tableau: Why did you choose to analyze Salesforce data in Tableau? Chris: So we love Salesforce and it does a great job as a CRM and a lot of what it's supposed to do, but at the same time, the analytics aren't so sexy. So we like to pull everything out and put it in Tableau. Tableau: How did you get started with Tableau Cloud? Chris: So it started out as a sales platform. And we wanted to communicate where sales were occurring, what sales were occurring, what types of products. It was answering the questions who, what, where, when, how. And we could push that out in the cloud. Tableau: Has use of Tableau Cloud expanded beyond the sales organization? Chris: So we enabled our selling organization on mobile devices. They all have iPads. They have their Galaxy Notes. It was a way for us to just push legacy sales data out so they could look at the past. We started looking at it from the standpoint of there is more functionality in this business that we can use data for. So we expanded it from sales to marketing to finance to supply chain. And it continues to percolate through the organization. We're going to get there. Everybody's going to be using it one day, we plan on that for sure. Tableau: What kind of problems were you looking to solve when you found Tableau? Chris: Without internal communications, with factual data, we were useless. When Tableau came on board, the ah-hah moment was we can now communicate with each other, which means that we can ask our customers what they need as well. And that was very important for our future. Tableau: It seems like communication is a critical aspect of your Tableau installation. Chris: We said that we want to make sure that we can communicate. The number-one thing that we need from ourselves is to communicate internally, that's how a business moves forward and that's how you treat customers the way they want to be treated. Tableau: Did that change how you worked with your customers? Chris: Customers were not necessarily giving us verbatim what they wanted, but they were giving us Internet-based data, cloud-based data that we could then take, interpret, and run it through a marketing logarithm that we could figure out what it is that we needed to do to advance ourselves and become a company that stays around for another 120 years. Tableau: Can you explain the \u201cinternet-based data\u201d your customers were giving you? Chris: They were giving us this feedback through Google, through all different types of web-based platforms that we could gather data and collect trend-based information, so when someone searches for a glass vial, what is it that they're looking for specifically and what can we take from that data to determine what we would come out to market with? Tableau: So how do you use Tableau on a daily basis now? Chris: I'm going to test it. If I don't like it, I'm going to change it. And I can do that very quickly with Tableau Cloud, even simply changing the title on the dashboard is very easy for us to do and we manage it all within our own commercial group."

Before, teams within the General Auditing department at Banco Nacional were consuming large volumes of data in Excel files and SQL tools, limiting their ability to make quick data discoveries. Processing information could take days. They knew that they had to find a system that could handle their large dataset and provide faster insights. After several recommendations, they trialed Tableau. They realized that with Tableau, they could immediately start querying their data. Today, Banco Nacional can surface information in a matter of hours. The quick turnaround time allows the General Auditing department to collaborate with other departments, providing data to the users who need it most. (Video in Spanish) Tableau: How has Tableau changed things for Banco Nacional? Nelson Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Ram\u00edrez, Specialist Auditor, Continuous Auditing Management: The utility of Tableau is impressive in terms of visualizing data. It's a whole different ball game. Instead of looking at a table of numbers or structured information, we get to see a graphic where you can take decisions almost immediately. Where you can spot trends or make comparisons between offices or products or see if the financial goals were achieved or not. Tableau: What are your data needs? What were you doing before Tableau? How did the transition go? Nelson: Our organization deals with a very high volume of data. We already had tools to use, but they were unable to cope with this large amount of data. So we performed a benchmarking test on various tools available on the market. They all had very high dependency in terms of IT. We wanted to find something that would be a better match for trade expert requirements. We had a look at Tableau, as it came recommended to us. We made initial contact and carried out a concept trial. This trial gave us impressive data in a variety of areas. There was no tool configuration process to go through. We didn't have to seek out an IT technician to go through it for us. Installation was immediate. It only took a minute. Tableau: How has Tableau made a difference for your business? Nelson: We have been able to work with the relevant parties on our own terms and, working hand-in-hand with business, we feel we have become more efficient in what we can offer all areas of the organization. Before, it took days to process information. Now, in a matter of hours, we already have the information practically ready for analysis. Tableau: What would happen if you couldn\u2019t use Tableau anymore? Nelson: If we couldn't use Tableau, we would be put back to where we were some time ago. Like a couple of years ago. We would have a fairly large workload in terms of processing data. We would have to see how we could fragment information to run it through the tools we had at that time, which were Excel and other SQL tools. But this would mean turning back the clock to a process that took days to prepare information for analysis. Tableau: What would you say to someone considering Tableau? Nelson: I would recommend everyone who wanted to use Tableau. First install it and try it out. They'll see what an innovative process it is. How it is so user-friendly and powerful. It gives people a better understanding of data. This is going to be a great benefit to any organization in which it is used."

Arby\u2019s used Tableau to map customer behavior using point-of-sale data, discovering that remodeling locations led to increased sales. With this knowledge, Arby\u2019s executed five times more remodels within a year. Automating the Financial Planning and Analysis group\u2019s 6-hour reporting process in Tableau helped operations track promotion success and spot issues, impacting field responses and saving money. When Arby\u2019s Restaurant Group was renovating their chain of restaurants, they faced some questions. What happens to the customers when a restaurant closes for renovation? Where do they go? And do they come back when the restaurant reopens? Mapping point of sale (POS) data in Tableau, the Business Intelligence team monitored the flow of customers to nearby locations during renovation periods, tracking remodel progress by week and overall return on investment. \u201cIn the remodel, we plotted the stores, their latitude and longitude, on a map in Tableau. We would animate it over time, and as a store closed for remodel, you would see sales grow for the stores around it,\u201d said Karl Riddett, Manager of Business Intelligence and Analytics. When the restaurants reopened, they saw customers flocking to renovated stores, proving that a fresh look attracted more business. \u201cThe remodel dashboard specifically allows our CFO and VP of Finance and development officers to see how well the remodels are performing,\u201d said Karl. \u201cThe data showed that we need to spend more money remodeling our restaurants, freshening up the look. That it really has helped the business.\u201d Based on this knowledge, Arby\u2019s executed five times the amount of remodels within a year and continued this effort throughout the following year. In addition to remodels, the team uses Tableau to correlate evaluation data and qualitative scores. For example, Arby\u2019s combines point-of-sale and guest experience data to understand whether customers have had a positive brand experience\u2014and to predict if a customer is likely to return to the store, use a coupon, etc. Arby\u2019s used this quantitative data to track the success of their \u201cGive a Dollar\u201d charity promotion where a customer would give a dollar and get a $2 coupon in return. Karl recalled, \u201cOur controller came to me and said, \"Hey, could you see what we can do with Tableau because we're seeing some funny things with the data coming in.\" They could tell something wasn't right, but they didn't know what it was.\u201d With Tableau, the team could spot the issue, take action, and distribute the data to the field to make the necessary changes. \u201cWe produced the dashboard, we put it out in the field, and the directors in the field made changes. And you could see that we got the issue corrected. So we're seeing operations actually make changes because they're able to see the data and see what was going on.\u201d \u201cThere was a real financial impact that saved the company some money and saved our foundation some money as well.\u201d After seeing the success of the remodel dashboard, Arby\u2019s Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) team approached the analytics team about their six-hour Excel reporting process. With Tableau, the FP&A team eliminated the six-hour process and gained deeper insight into finance data. For example, the team can now track how remodeled restaurants impact existing restaurant sales\u2014enabling accurate forecasting and data-driven decision making around franchise planning. These Tableau projects inspired Arby\u2019s to create an analytics committee, which meets monthly to discuss the vision for future analytics efforts. The committee encourages departments to explore Tableau Server to source inspiration for new dashboards. These efforts increased collaboration between teams and created one centralized repository for accurate data, which didn\u2019t exist before Tableau. \u201cIt gives one place for people to go to and see what's going on. We didn't have that before at Arby's. I think the real ROI that we're seeing is with certain people being able to really fully express themselves and what they want to do in their role and answer questions.\u201d"

        "company": "Michigan Medicine",
        "content": "Michigan Medicine is home to one of the largest health care complexes in the world, with three hospitals, 40 outpatient hospitals, and more than 140 clinics. Michigan Medicine\u2019s Fast Analytics team serves the data needs of over 30 internal groups. With Tableau, automated reporting saved the health system over 5,000 hours on four different projects in a year. What was siloed information is now accessible to over a dozen people across teams, leading to faster decisions. A charge estimate dashboard built in Tableau sped up a four-and-a-half hour process into a four-and-a-half second query. These time savings allowed Michigan Medicine to reassign headcount to more strategic projects and disseminate data across the organization. Previously Michigan Medicine\u2019s analytics team managed a large, \u201carchaic\u201d billing system. To produce reports, they either had to do the coding themselves or pay large fees to an outside vendor, and the final output was often late or incorrect. \u201cTo get a report out that we needed, we either had to code it ourselves in an obscure language, or we had to pay the vendor to do it for us. It was very costly,\u201d explains Jonathan Greenberg, Director of Fast Analytics. \u201cHalf the time, even when we paid the vendor, we would find out later that delays and other problems with their internal processes would keep us waiting far past the estimate, the cost would always be higher, and it wasn't an efficient way to run the reporting section of our group.\u201d As Michigan Medicine shifted its billing system to Epic, the organization realized the need for a faster, scalable analytics platform. \u201cWe knew we needed something quick. We knew we needed something efficient, and we knew we needed to have a product ready once Epic rolled out and folks were starting to look for their data again.\u201d To counter these challenges, Michigan Medicine implemented Tableau and the Fast Analytics team was born, tasked with assisting over 30 groups with their dashboards. Jonathan explains how \u201cthere are at least four projects that [the Fast Analytics team] completed that have saved over 5,000 hours in the last fiscal year,\u201d with help from Tableau. Initially, the Fast Analytics team created a report for an internal customer that eliminated 48 hours of work per week. Additionally, more teams have access to the dashboard, allowing for more creative, data-driven problem solving. \u201cShe was reassigned to a much higher level of work, and not only was that dashboard available for the ED department where it was needed, but with a dropdown we were able to give filtering to all the departments. And so now, 19 groups can use it instead of just one.\u201d The team created a charge estimate tool that better assists customer service staff in providing estimates to external customers about healthcare services. \u201cWe took a four-and-a-half-hour process that involved a number of tools and high level of expertise and turned it into four and a half second query,\u201d said Jonathan. This tool has become a \u201ccritical component\u201d of their customer service business model as self-pay becomes more prevalent. These dashboards are now more readily available across the organization, leading to faster reporting and better resource allocation. \"We used to have two people who could do this process, and now we have 17 because it's so simple.\" Jonathan shares how Tableau allowed Michigan Medicine to automate 85 to 92 percent of their reconciliation and provided a baseline to quickly reconcile the remaining portion\u2014which wasn\u2019t possible before the software. \u201cThe time impact was huge. It's actually immeasurable because the old number was infinity. We never really were able to reconcile an entire month prior to this tool being created by my team.\u201d When the Fast Analytics team built a request for the executive strategy group, they combined over 50 data sources into \u201cwell over 60 visualizations.\u201d The executive management team continues to use these dashboards to track success against organization-wide metrics and goals. In addition to serving Michigan Medicine\u2019s reporting needs, Jonathan explains how Tableau integrates with existing systems to keep data secure. \u201cTableau gave us the ability to integrate with our native identity management system, which is all through Active Directory. One of the advantages of using Tableau is that we can create Active Directory groups that can be managed outside of Tableau, put that work and that management in the hands of our customers, and we get out of the data access business.\u201d Aside from onboarding efforts, the Fast Analytics team empowers teams to dive into their own data with Tableau. This allows the analytics team to work on high-level projects and gives 30 internal teams the ability to find insights in their data. Jonathan says, \u201cThere is no doubt that we are in an ROI far beyond what we paid for the software.\u201d"

Ciena first adopted Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server internally as enterprise business intelligence solutions. After success with the platform, the company created an analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) offering to customers, powered by Tableau Cloud. With Tableau Cloud, Ciena delivers market-differentiating analytics to customers, including insights about market trends, equipment needs, and market share. Instead of waiting up to a year for an executive engagement, sales teams now have direct communication with executives from top accounts. Ciena adopted Tableau as its enterprise analytics platform across several departments. Business intelligence teams use Tableau to analyze orders, revenue statistics, regional statistics, maintenance contracts, and more. Hundreds of employees share results and collaborate using Tableau Server. After solidifying internal analytics processes, Ciena leadership turned its attention to customer-facing analytics. Previously, Ciena consultants would create manual reports for each customer. Simon Brueckheimer, Leader in the Field Analytics Office, remembers losing weekends developing and adapting spreadsheets for customers. VP of Global Accounts Keri Gilder recalls spending up to a year trying to get an executive engagement with a customer. To respond to growing data demands, Ciena adopted Tableau Cloud as an AaaS offering to customers. With their own Tableau Cloud logins, Ciena\u2019s customers rest assured that their data is secure, and Ciena can provide the right level of governance with a permissions model by site and project. With Tableau Cloud, clients can dig into their individual dashboards to understand market trends, project service and equipment needs, and make strategic decisions about how to win the most market share. \u201cThe analytics that we are using to provide effective consultancy are really winning people over among our clients,\u201d explains Simon Brueckheimer. Today, Ciena consultants can identify meaningful trends, outliers, and dive into details like never before, giving Ciena a competitive advantage. Instead of long weekends spent in spreadsheets, consultants can now update data within a matter of minutes. And the sales team is already seeing results. Instead of calling upon clients, executives from client accounts often directly request meetings to discuss their data. \u201cWe're enabling [Sales] to extract insights they would otherwise not be able to achieve,\u201d explains Ian Harris, Senior Director. \u201cIt enables us to partner with their customers rather than just sell to them, and that's extremely valuable and extremely differentiating.\u201d With Tableau, \u201cCustomers look at their services and see what the go-to-market options are for them in order to be successful,\u201d shares Keri Gilder, Vice President of Global Accounts. \u201cThere's no question that the demands on our clients mean that they have to be a lot more agile. And by using Tableau, we can be a lot more agile, and I think that's to the benefit of both of us in partnership.\u201d Ciena chose Tableau Cloud to power its AaaS offering because of the flexibility it provided the company and its clients. As a fully hosted solution, Ciena can get quickly onboard customers as needed, reducing downtime and delivering insights as fast as possible. \u201c[Tableau Cloud] means that we can project those valuable data sets and analytics results out to our customers in real time. We can provide updates; we can help them add users; we can provide all of the dynamic usage capabilities that the cloud inherently provides,\u201d says Simon. \u201cThe fact that we can design something and have a seamless delivery mechanism\u2014I think that's the real power for our clients.\u201d Today, Ciena delivers reports to any customer, anywhere, confident that the data is secure as well as beautiful. No more spreadsheets, no more lost weekends. \u201cIt's smart, it's clean, and the data is very fresh. There's no software installation, no consultant has to go to site. And intuitively, people understand it.\u201d"

The company has experienced tremendous business growth in recent years. This strong growth generates a large amount of data on sales, finance, and marketing. Antonius Hermawan, Management Information Systems (MIS) Manager at Paramount Enterprise, leads a team that supports many of the company's business units. His challenge was to utilize this data to improve the business. They decided to leverage Tableau\u2019s rapid-fire data analytics and visualization capabilities to take advantage of their data. With Tableau, Paramount Enterprises has experienced: Employees in several business units at Paramount Enterprise previously used Microsoft Excel to create reports. They regularly worked with hundreds of spreadsheet files, accessing data from different databases, and they would often need to blend data from multiple sources. The person in charge would manually consolidate data provided by the business units into one report. The process was time consuming, with potential for human error. Additionally, the data was presented as plain reconciliation reports in a tabular format, making it difficult for users to get any real insights from the information. The Paramount Enterprise team realized that they needed an easy-to-use, fast data analytics and visualization solution. They decided to adopt Tableau. \u201cAt first, many of my colleagues thought Tableau was just a reporting tool. They realized that it could do so much more, like data analysis and visualization, when they tried it,\u201d said Antonius. With the buy-in of the company\u2019s management, Antonius\u2019 team got to work implementing Tableau from the ground up. Part of this implementation involved training business users on how to best leverage the tool to get results. They conducted demonstrations and worked with users to help them quickly get up to speed with the tool. The management team at Paramount Enterprise turns to Tableau dashboards delivered over Tableau Server to get the latest business and operational updates. They also have access to Tableau Story Points, used to walk them through reports. Furthermore, they can access the information on the road using tablets running on Android or iOS platforms. Today with Tableau, most of the reports are largely automated, as the software refreshes reports and visualizations when there is new source data available. Automatic updates ensure that reports contain current data. Tableau has increased speed and reduced human error at Paramount Enterprise. \u201cOur manual reporting process was time consuming with a chance of unnoticed data error. Tableau helps us to generate the report faster and more accurate, giving my team more time to focus on other important aspects of the business,\u201d commented Lucy Puspa, Associate Director of Finance at Paramount Enterprise. Tableau visualizes the finance and sales data that was previously presented in spreadsheets. This allows users to quickly grasp important information and identify trends. Paramount Enterprise Chief of Corporate Technology Yongki RS said: \u201cWe used to put out finance and sales reports that were plain tabular reconciliation tables. Now with Tableau, the reports come with graphical elements and they are much more impactful visually.\u201d \u201cWe believe the entire team at Paramount Enterprise has benefitted from Tableau. The company can now leverage data, tapping into it for more informed decision making,\u201d added Yongki."

        "content": "The Christie NHS Foundation Trust is a specialist cancer center that treats over 44,000 patients a year. It\u2019s the largest single-site cancer center in Europe. In the past, nurses had a hard time surfacing noncompliance issues. By the time the issue was identified, either the next day or next month, the window of opportunity had already passed. Today, nurses access data on their nurse assessment dashboards, published on Tableau Server. In video 1, Daniel Tibble, Business Intelligence Manager, explains how nurses track patient assessments in real time, on a ward by ward basis. Active Directory allows the business intelligence team to manage permissions and keep the underlying data safe. In video 2, Daniel shares how other departments in the hospital create and share dashboards, leading to more data discovery and engagement. As Daniel explains, professionals who \u201cpreviously saw working with technology as incidental to their role are really engaging with it to be able to deliver better patient care.\u201d Tableau: Tell us about the Christie and how you\u2019re using Tableau. Daniel Tibble, Business Intelligence Manager: The Christie is a specialist cancer center. The dashboards in the Christie are created by a combination of my team, the business intelligence team, and there's also users out there who are comfortable using Tableau as a tool, who are able to interrogate the data, make their own findings, and produce dashboards off the back, which we can then surface using Tableau Server. A lot of our reporting comes from the operational side to make sure that the operation managers and the teams know what's happening on a day-to-day basis in the hospital. We've also got a number of clinically focused dashboards. We've got some dashboards that are focused for nursing assessment care. We're also trying to surface some clinical outcome data within Tableau and working closely with our clinical outcomes team to do that. Tableau: Have you had any \"wow\" moments with Tableau? Daniel: The biggest wow factor so far with Tableau Server has been our nurse assessment dashboards. This has meant that the nurses can track which patients haven't had assessments on a ward by ward basis in real time. By surfacing the data in real time, it means that the nurses can deal with any noncompliance issues before it becomes a problem. Previously, if you're surfacing that the next day or the next month, the period of being able to do the assessments within the six-hour window has already passed. Tableau: How do you keep sensitive healthcare data safe within those dashboards? Daniel: We synchronize Tableau Server with Active Directory, which allows us to very quickly manage people's access, not just to Tableau, but also the underlying data sources and our report provisioning software. This dashboard is by far and away our most used site on Tableau Server. We get around 500 hits a month. It's a great example of a role that previously saw working with technology as incidental to their role to really engaging with it to be able to deliver better patient care. Tableau: What\u2019s your own take on self-service BI? Daniel: I'm a massive advocate of self-service BI. BI should be decision-focused. And decisions are made in real time, they're not made on a schedule, which is how a lot of BI tools deliver their information. If users can go and get the information at the point they're making the decision, it means that they can become an agile, strategic, decision-making organization. It means they can make the decisions in a more agile manner. Tableau: Has Tableau helped save time and increase efficiency? Daniel: So not only has Tableau Server reduced the turnaround time for requests because people can go and get the information themselves, it has also led to more detailed, better questions. A big benefit of Tableau is that we don't have to have dedicated developer resource. This means that users who know the data and are used to using it can interrogate it themselves and can create their own dashboards, which then can be published. We also found a really powerful tool for data discovery in workshops. You can, unlike other BI tools, you can sit there with service managers and operational leads and people who really know the data they work in through the hospital and look at the data and discover trends, efficiencies, and any potential improvements that can be made. Tableau: Has Tableau given you new insights into your data sources? Daniel: A great benefit of Tableau is it allows you to interrogate data sources before you build the underlying data structure. We've learned a lot about our data warehouse data structure by interrogating the source data first in Tableau, which when you're trying to build a data warehouse using agile methodologies is a really important tool."

        "company": "The Information Lab Netherlands B.V.",
        "content": "Before The Information Lab, Martijn worked in the field of web analytics. He recalls extracting data from Google Analytics and other sources, analyzing the data in Excel or directly in the databases using SQL. Monthly web analytics reports could take up to a week, especially if the customer was multinational. With Tableau, he can connect to these web data sources (and others) with the web data connector. The monthly reporting process that once took a week, takes one or two hours in Tableau. He can complete trend analyses in just a few clicks and digging deeper into the data is equally simple. Tableau: Why do you enjoy using Tableau? Martijn Verstrepen, Consultant and System Integrator: So why use Tableau? I think that it makes it much easier to gain insight from your data and then take actions based on those insights. For me, that would be the main reason to use Tableau. And now I also have a lot more time to concentrate on letting the visualizations speak more. For me, that is really the biggest plus point. Tableau: What tools did you use before Tableau? Martijn: Before I used Tableau, I actually used a whole range of tools. Because I came from the field of web analysis, I mostly used web analysis software. I worked a lot with Google Analytics, Piwik (which is an open-source web analysis tool), Adobe Omniture. But that\u2019s specifically on the web analysis side. As the data emerged from these, I usually went straight to a tool like Excel or even just raw databases, which you can try MySQL via SQL to resolve the analyses. Say you have 50 sites and the customer is a multinational. All of the web statistics had to be imported from 50 different websites once a month to allow the monthly reports to be issued. That easily took an entire week. Tableau: And how has your experienced changed now that you use Tableau? Martijn: With Tableau, you can do that with web data connector, for example, or in the case of Google with the integral connector. It\u2019s a one-off task to set up the connector and after that, the process can be run again every month. It\u2019s one press of a button, and it fixes itself. So, from a week\u2019s work every month to around one to two hours\u2019 work a month to generate the same report. Tableau: What would you say to someone who was considering Tableau for their company? Martijn: The reason I would advise someone to start working with Tableau is not only the convenience in the time that you save doing all of those boring tasks that you have to report every month, but on the other hand, simply the enormous quantity of extra insight you can obtain from that data. For example, trend analyses that normally you would have great difficulty generating in Excel, can now be done in 3 clicks. You have the picture and if it appears that there is a peak or trough somewhere that you want to investigate further, with five clicks you are much further on, and you immediately have the answer to the question of what precisely is going on. Tableau: How would you describe your journey with Tableau? Martijn: I am now noticing that with Tableau, I can continue to learn in it. Every day there is something new that I think, 'oh that\u2019s not possible,' but it is if we do this, that, or the other. You actually continue to, let\u2019s say, trigger yourself constantly but with new, cool things that ultimately appear to be excellent in Tableau."

        "content": "The University of Birmingham is a university in the UK, focused on encouraging \u201cbold, independent thinking\u201d from students. In the past, the business intelligence team at the University of Birmingham struggled with inflexible reports, making it difficult to incorporate feedback from colleagues. Compiling information for their research excellence framework\u2014a crucial dataset for operations\u2014used to take up to 20 people to analyze the data in Excel, produce statistics, and share the data with managers. Today, the university uses Tableau Desktop & Server to compile, visualize, and share important information across teams. The research excellence framework that used to take 20 people, now takes an hour. And they hope to make data even more accessible. The business intelligence team is working on a university key performance indicators dashboard built on Tableau Server, allowing more people to engage with reports on a daily basis. Tableau: How does your team use Tableau? Rob Andrew, Head of Business Intelligence: One of the ways that we now use Tableau is, assuming that we've got the right data source and we've got the right data, we're able to produce visualizations very quickly from that or be able to make visualizations that can be adapted very quickly based on our user feedback. Tableau: What was the situation before Tableau? Rob: So in the past, we might take quite a lot of time to build reports and then publish those reports. And if you got feedback, it's probably quite difficult to go and change it because it had been built in such a specific way that they actually became quite inflexible. Tableau: And how has that changed? Rob: Whereas with Tableau now, we find that we can produce a visualization and adapt it very quickly and also the ability for us to be able to produce those visualizations in the first place is much more rapid. And it also means that we can change the way that sometimes we go about a process. Tableau: Do you have an example of a time where you sped up the process because of Tableau? Rob: So, one example that we found recently was we were getting some information about the research excellence framework for 2014, which is a key piece of information for universities. We got the results in December. So five years ago when we did that same exercise, we had a batch of 20 people geared up to be able to use Excel, to be able to download the data, to produce some initial statistics, and then went around the university with Excel spreadsheets trying to inform our managers about what was going on. And then we got the situation where actually as a result of the initial analysis that we provided, there was some request to get some additional measures and metrics produced in time for the next data results coming out. Now, if this had been five years ago, we'd have been not in a position to be able to produce that additional analysis. Whereas this time, by creating some extra calculations overnight, we're then able to load the data within an hour, the next day, and also produce the analysis straight away without the 20 people required to do that process. Tableau: What did that experience show you? Rob: So, for us, it was a real demonstration about the fact that the software tool allowed us to start doing rapid analysis in a way that we hadn't been able to do before. Tableau: What were you using before Tableau? Rob: We've used a number of different tools. So that's ranged from Access, Excel, et cetera. And IBM Business Objects, and in the last few years, we came across Tableau. And the thing that we particularly like about Tableau is the fact that it engaged users because of its visualizations. And we do think it's a tool that we would like to work with because it actually gets people to start looking at reports and engaging with them rather than just maybe just glancing over them, not really taking in the content. Tableau: Can you share a little bit about how you implemented Tableau at the university? Rob: We've implemented Tableau over the last three or four years now to be across the university. So we've got a Tableau Server implementation. We've got access to professional services staff and also to our academic community staff, so that's heads of schools right down to professional services staff. Tableau: Are you seeing more people interact with data now that you have Tableau? Rob: People are engaging with those reports more than they would have done. And we are getting feedback from that as well. And, recently, we've been developing a university key performance indicators dashboard, and that's been going through our council for approval and executive board for approval. And I think people have come back and said this looks really good and they like the visualization. And they're very pleased about the output that's been produced. And I think that's an example of people then starting to engage with the data and appreciate what it looks like and then they'll start using it. So I think there's a growing appreciation of what the visualizations can do. And I think we ourselves are learning how to best use Tableau in a way to actually increase that user engagement. And so what we're doing is we're trying to set up our own user community to make sure that people adopt best practice, they get enthused like we are about using the product. Tableau: How has Tableau changed the way that you approach data? Rob: With the Tableau software, we find that there's more opportunities to actually explore data and present it in different ways. And so we can take the feedback as to what are the important issues around the data set or a business area and then try and reflect that data back."

In this video, Anne Lutgerink, Project Manger and Communications Advisor for EP-Nuffic, describes how the transition from print to online has addressed the existing needs of the organization and revealed where they can take their business in the future. Tableau: What does EP-Nuffic do? Anne Lutgerink, Project Manager and Communications Advisor: We work on internationalization in education. That means that we are constantly engaged in seeing how we can make Dutch education more international, but also how we can take Dutch education abroad. Tableau: What version of Tableau are you using? Anne: We use Tableau Public to give everyone access. We also don\u2019t want to impose any restrictions on users, so we use Tableau Public and embed it in our own website. Tableau: What tool did you use before Tableau? Anne: We previously did not use any tool because we simply prepared a PDF publication. So a colleague collected all the data, wrote a nice piece about it, that went to the designer, and eventually a publication emerged from it. But now we actually have that whole process in one. Tableau: Where does your data come from? Anne: We work with 20 sources from UNESCO, OECD, DUO, CBS (Statistics Netherlands); a whole lot of organizations collect information about international students, and we try to combine all these sources in order to derive a useful report. Tableau: Tell us more about the report you create. Anne: Previously we issued a publication that we called \u2018Mobiliteit in Beeld\u2019 (\u2018Mobility in Images\u2019) and it gave the exact numbers of how many students came to the Netherlands and how many went abroad. It was really an annual publication and it contained graphs and an analysis of all those mobility trends. The problem with it was that moment you sent that thing to the printer, it was in fact already out of date. And, you are also tied to paper and you cannot put everything in a paper publication. So what we had in mind with Tableau was that we could make something very interactive. Tableau: How has your process changed with Tableau? Anne: The process of making the book took several months. Now, as soon as we receive a new source, we can import it [into Tableau] and everything is adjusted [on the web site] at the same time. Tableau: That is a big change. How is it working for you? Anne: Working with Tableau is very enjoyable because with all the data that you put it into it you immediately start making new combinations and discover how you can design something even better. Tableau: Has Tableau Public brought other benefits to your publication? Anne: Yes, we have started with giving an insight into mobility statistics, but internationalization is so much more than that. So we are already investigating which subjects we can present more visually. At present it is concerned only with higher education, but primary education, secondary education - we could also give an insight into all that information with Tableau. Tableau: What has surprised you? Anne: Tableau has shown me personally that it can be very easy to present complicated data in a visually attractive manner. And that has helped me greatly as project leader for this project, in actually reaching the goal of the project. Making the mobility flows apparent."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "FastLane Automotive Intelligence (FLA) is a market intelligence provider for automotive and finance industries, based in Gurgaon, India. The company has been operational since 2010. Since September 2014, FLA has access to pan-Indian vehicle registration data from the Road Transportation Authority (RTO) of India sourced from a legitimate government source. The team at FLA combines this data with existing industry expertise to provide customers with key industry insights and data that create a lasting impact on their growth strategies. Using Tableau, FLA has been able to deliver reliable industry data and competitive insights to its customers in the form of interactive reports, heat maps etc., which provide visibility into data and trends. Tableau enables FLA to generate these reports without significant time investments. FastLane has access to data on any new vehicle registration\u2014passenger and commercial\u2014for all types of vehicles. Using this information, FastLane has the ability to provide specific data to customers to help them establish better service networks and decide on growth strategies. For example, FastLane helps customers compare their market share with the competitor market share in a particular region. The region can be defined as a pin code or locality or state. This helps customers gauge the potential/opportunity to grow in that particular area. The company also supports banks and financial institutions with the data they need to approve loan disbursement. Banks cannot process loans unless they have authentication details from the Road Transportation Authority. FastLane provides the required data. When FastLane started offering these services, the company needed a tool that would enable it to provide effective insights to clients in the form of dashboards, graphs, and interactive reports. For the reports to be useful to customers, they needed to be interactive. For example, if the value changed for a particular number in the table, the maps and dashboards needed to automatically recalibrate to reflect the change. The tool also needed to enable online report sharing with customers. At the same time, it was necessary that it work well with Hadoop, since all company data was stored in a Cloudera Hadoop framework. The company considered using Cognos, but Abhishek Bhardwaj, Head of Business Technology at FastLane India, had used it in his previous organization and was unhappy with the quality of output, especially the level of interactivity that the dashboards allowed. Also, the fact that report generation in Cognos required some technical skills was a drawback. Given his past experience with Tableau, Abhishek recommended that the company invest in Tableau to analyze its 200 million rows of raw data (approximately one terabyte of data). Fastlane worked with Bangalore, India-based firm, Data Semantics Pvt. Ltd for this implementation. FastLane began its engagement with Tableau in the form of a single Desktop access. Over the last few months, FastLane has added four more Tableau Desktop licenses. Currently, there are three people authoring Tableau, with data being accessed by about eight users. FastLane provides customers about five to six types of dashboards using Tableau. For example, one of them is an open opportunities dashboard. There are three reports as part of this dashboard. One is a heat-map of the region, the second is a basic table and the third is a map of the area. As Abhishek explains, \u201cIf we want to illustrate the open opportunity in any region to our client, we showcase parameters such as the national average, regional average, and potential for sales. We calculate the performance potential of the market based on some KPIs. We also provide insights into the projected sales that the company needs to generate in order to meet its projected growth numbers.\u201d Two of the most useful characteristics of Tableau are speed of report generation and the fact that users can publish reports without the need to master any additional technical skills, according to Abhishek. Additionally, its direct connector to Cloudera Hadoop and built-in functions such as table calculations and predictive analytics makes it extremely valuable for FastLane\u2019s sales team. Reports that would otherwise take about 10 hours to generate, can be generated in an hour or two, using Tableau. FastLane also extensively uses Tableau\u2019s mapping capability. This not only cuts cost but also eliminates the burden of sourcing compatible map software from outside. \u201cBut for Tableau, our report deliveries would have been delayed considerably and our time-to-market would have increased,\u201d said Abhishek. \u201cOur customers also appreciate the fact that we provide informative and interactive reports with an accurate physical representation.\u201d As its business grows, FastLane plans to invest in additional Tableau licenses to support its requirements. While Tableau is currently being used mainly to support FastLane\u2019s automotive business, plans are underway to extend its usage to the financial business arm as well. The company also plans to invest in Tableau Server to meet some its client requirements."

        "content": "Cranfield University is a research-based university in the United Kingdom. Cranfield is one of the largest academic settings in Western Europe for strategic applied research, development, and design for the aerospace field. The university also excels in areas such as manufacturing, transport systems, and technology. Dr. Uyioghosa Igie is a lecturer in the School of Aerospace, Transport, and Manufacturing at Cranfield. His research students analyze data to determine engine behavior and patterns to help optimize performance. When Dr. Igie started looking for a data analysis tool for his class, he needed an engaging tool that would show the research journey\u2014without the labor of intensive data formatting. After Dr. Igie saw students\u2019 positive reaction to Tableau, he chose it as the preferred tool for his research classes. Igie estimates that his class has reduced the time spent on data analysis by half and says that now students have time to exceed expectations and \u201cdo thing that really matter.\u201d Tableau: Can you tell us a little bit about your job at Cranfield University? Dr. Uyioghosa Igie: I'm in the School of Aerospace, Transport, and Manufacturing. I'm more into performance. I'm involved in research and teaching at the university. Basically, within the School of Aerospace, Transport, and Manufacturing, we're looking to gas turbines. And then we typically get data from operators and try and investigate engine behavior and patterns. Tableau: How are you using data in your classes? Dr. Igie: It's our job, really, to look into this data and work out how much the engine has actually lost in terms of performance. So when I say gas turbines, I'm talking about gas turbines for aerospace, gas turbines for stationary application, power generation, and also gas turbines for mechanical drive application. My research students will typically have an engine data from a power station. The most recent one we have, actually, is from a power station with about four engines. And the interesting thing is to try and quantify the impact of, let's say, an online wash or, for example, quantify the degradation: how much the engine is actually losing. And it's also always very useful to try and not just show results, but then take the student through the journey of actually achieving those results is very important. Tableau: How does Tableau help you achieve that? Dr. Igie: Tableau is just brilliant in terms of trying to engage a class. Again, using things like motion charts, it's like we're running the engine all over again. Again, it's also raised the bar as well. It's important that we actually try to focus on things which really matter, to our partners as well. I think it's really empowering when we, as a university, tell operators how best to do things. And I think that's really wonderful. Tableau: Have you noticed any time-savings? What impact has Tableau had on your classes? Dr. Igie: We've actually cut down the time we spend, about half actually, and my students now do things which really matter as opposed to just trying to get data in the right format. But what I'm trying to say here really is that Tableau has a way of actually engaging students, you know, in the material itself. It's a very intuitive software. And students are able to go just beyond what you normally expect from them using Tableau."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Polkomtel is one of the largest mobile communications operators in Poland, operating under brands such as Plus, Plus na Kart\u0119, Mixplus, and Plus Internet. Before Tableau, Polkomtel dealt with static reports, with teams relying on spreadsheets or disparate systems for their data analysis needs. By the time that reports reached the hands of decision-makers, they were outdated. When Business Intelligence Partner Grzegorz Szalachwij and the BI selection committee at Polkomtel were evaluating a new tool to solve this problem, they chose Tableau for its intuitive platform and the ability to drill down into data on the fly. Today, Polkomtel has approximately 300 Tableau users, including analysts, business users, and employees \u201cin every corner of the company.\u201d For example, financial analysts use Tableau by integrating with the SAP HANA platform. Teams at Polkomtel also analyze data processed on a Hadoop platform, along with Tableau Data Extracts that are used for speedy data discovery. Tableau is most present in meetings with directors to monitor sales and marketing performance. Instead of days or weeks, Szalachwij says that insights are ready ten times more quickly than before they had Tableau. Tableau: Tell us about Polkomtel. Grzegorz Szalachwij, Business Intelligence Partner: Polkomtel is one of the largest mobile communications operators in Poland marketing its services under brands: Plus, Plus na Kart\u0119, Mixplus, Plus Internet and offers combined services with media brands like Cyfrowy Polsat and Ipla as the member of Cyfrowy Polsat Group. Polkomtel's offering is continuously being extended into electricity services, financial services (Plus Bank), and VAS services. We pioneered innovative mobile technology services in the Polish market, including being the first company to offer UMTS and LTE service. Tableau: What was life like before Tableau? Grzegorz: Our reporting was static. Marketing, sales, customer service, and other teams all relied on spreadsheets or on classic reporting suites for their reporting. The problem was that it was very labor-intensive to integrate the data, investigate it, develop the reports, and finally be able to explain reporting numbers in detail. And of course, all these task took time, so by the time the data was in the hands of the decision-makers, it was often outdated. Tableau: So what did you do? Grzegorz: I was on the BI selection committee that was thinking of introducing new tool to answer these problems. We really liked the intuitive nature of the Tableau platform; the ability to drill down in near real-time to the data, and of course the visual presentations. However, we realized that the best way to get to know Tableau wasn\u2019t through some laboratory exercise, but by deploying it into the heart of the company and giving the tool to the hands of analytics users. And so we did. Tableau: Who uses Tableau in Polkomtel? Grzegorz: Right now we have approximately 300 users, comprising data analysts and business end users, across almost every corner of the company: Sales, Marketing, Operations, Finance, Networks and more. The original use case was to deepen our insight into sales and marketing performance and it\u2019s still used a lot there. Over time though, the use of Tableau has spread to other lines of business, primarily because it\u2019s so easy to use and so popular with the users. If you walk through the company now, you\u2019ll see Tableau on PCs, supporting management reporting, geomarketing, data mining analysis, and financial analysis. The last one is made possible by the integration with the SAP HANA platform. Tableau also analyses the data processed on the Hadoop platform. We also use Tableau Data Extracts to take a snapshot of the data for even faster data analytics and data discovery. Tableau: Tell us more about some of the use cases. Grzegorz: Tableau is probably most visible during the regular director-level meetings, which monitor and report on retail sales and marketing performance, demand for data services and other metrics. Insights can be ready in real-time compared to postponing answers for next days or weeks. So I can say we are ready with our insights at least 10 times more quickly during these meetings now we have Tableau. Executives can even ask questions \u2018on the fly\u2019 and receive immediate answers during the meeting itself. The time to insight has dropped dramatically, on almost all our reporting\u2014from sales forecasts right down to granular call detail reports. For example, if a director asks, \u2018How is our Plus prepaid discount campaign currently performing in the Warsaw region, versus in Krakow?\u2019 it only takes a few seconds to explore the results of the promotion, and drill down into the demographics of the audience, their geography, and existing relationship with Plus. Beyond this use case, you\u2019ll see Tableau being used in classic analytical processes through to advanced predictive analytics in fraud detection, call center KPI reports and many other situations. Tableau: You\u2019re saying you can now get to answers 10 times more quickly than you could before. What does that mean to Polkomtel? Grzegorz: It means business agility. It means increased competitiveness. And it means business growth. We can now respond far more quickly to sales, marketing, and other opportunities. That business opportunity might be hidden somewhere in our data, but Tableau exposes it immediately. Tableau: What do the users say about Tableau? Grzegorz: Tableau is a complete analytical tool. It\u2019s simple to use, intuitive, and the visualizations impress everyone who sees them. From a single app, we can visualize our retail data, geo-location data, and so much more. And of course, we are able to connect with multiple different and complex environments to get these answers, including Teradata, MS SQL Server, SAP HANA, Hadoop, and SAS. Tableau: What role has AstraFox played in your success? Grzegorz: It was AstraFox that delivered this Tableau solution at Polkomtel. Our expectations were high when we involved them on our Tableau deployment. We weren\u2019t disappointed."

        "content": "Hult International Business School offers global programs for business students. Hult\u2019s network of seven campuses in international markets gives students an opportunity to study in a variety of business settings and cultures. In the past, Hult served campus decision makers with ad hoc reports, created in Excel. Zeeshan Zuberi, Technical Director at Hult, was tasked with making data available to staff members across the organization. The catch? The new solution had to connect to Hult\u2019s Salesforce data, as well as their learning management system, available on Amazon Redshift. He also had to avoid the steep development effort involved in creating a central reporting system. When Zeeshan discovered the ease and convenience of Tableau Desktop, he decided that it would be the tool of choice at Hult to help create a culture of self-service analytics. To manage permissions, the IT team at Hult implemented Tableau Server. In Server, the team could apply relevant user filtering for each campus. Today, Hult distributes many dashboards through Tableau Server, including their automated sales and marketing dashboard. The dashboard is currently helping leaders and C-level officers make educated decisions on a daily basis. Tableau: What made you interested in Tableau? Zeeshan Zuberi, Technical Director: Last year, I was asked to look into how we can make data available to our staff members all across the organization. When I saw how easy and convenient it is to look and visualize data, I immediately thought that this would be our tool of choice at Hult International Business School. Tableau: How did you roll out Tableau across the organization? Zeeshan: We started partnering with other departments where we had data end users and we tried asking them to start becoming comfortable with Tableau Desktop. While doing so, we were also rolling out the visualizations that we built on Tableau Server for these people to benefit from. And this is how we started rolling out Tableau slowly across the organization. Tableau: Are you receiving a positive response from employees? Zeeshan: The adoption for Tableau has been fantastic. So I would say I never saw any other software package adopted that fast. And with that, we were also able to surface dashboards very rapidly. So compared to traditional reporting systems where report developers are too worried about formatting the report their selves, not just about preparing data. Tableau: Can you give an example of a dashboard that you share through Tableau Server? Zeeshan: One of the first dashboards that we built on Tableau was about our sales marketing curves, which has been developed on Excel in the past and it has been used for years. Tableau: How has that sales and marketing report changed now that it\u2019s a Tableau dashboard? Zeeshan: Once we automated that dashboard on Tableau, we got this \"wow\" from the whole organization. And currently, the consumers of those dashboards involve most of the C-level officers and our regional heads, which essentially lets them look at how their weekly sales are doing. Which was impossible previously without churning lots of data every Monday morning where a couple of individuals who used to wake up so early in the morning, now we don't have to worry about that, it's a completely automated process. And for that reason, we were specifically looking for bringing the culture of self-service analytics, and this is where Tableau helped us. Tableau: Where do you store your sales data and how do you pull it into Tableau? Zeeshan: So like any other typical educational institution, we have got a CRM, which is cloud-based CRM, and Tableau, thankfully, has a connector already available. So at times, we directly connect through the connector available with Tableau. We have learning management system, which is also cloud based, and they have their data warehouse available on Amazon Redshift, we connect to that as well. Tableau 9.1 has been something really wonderful because we connect to lots of Web-based data sources. And right now, because we don't have the ability to connect directly to those data sources, I believe it's going to save us some tremendous effort."

With more than 25 million downloads and managed a daily active user base of more than 2 million, the team at Playlab has a great deal of data they could analyze to enhance game play. \u201cWe did not want to spend time to develop our own data visualization tool,\u201d said Thomas Andreasen Chief Growth Officer (CGO) and co-founder of Playlab Games. The Playlab team now uses Tableau regularly to analyze and visualize over 10 million records daily. They can quickly gain insights into gaming behavior, track moves, and monitor purchases and payment\u2014all of which allows the team to improve designs and plan game levels. Playlab employs more than 100 people and also has production teams in Bangkok and Manila. Additionally, the company has an office in Singapore that handles game distribution. Playlab mobile games are so popular that there were more than 2 million active users accessing the games on a daily basis. The company has been actively collecting and analyzing a large amount of data using third-party analytics solutions. Playlab was tracking metrics including: how long users take to progress to a certain level, the number of moves left before the completion of a certain level, the average score users receive when they fail to complete a level, as well as in-game purchases and payments. At first, the Playlab team was pulling CSV files and extracting insights from spreadsheets. This process usually took a couple of days and it was difficult to get the full perspective surrounding their data. The team soon found that they were not able to get the information that they desired. The third-party analytics tools they were using, including Flurry Analytics, did not provide them with data visualization. They also wanted to look at the data from different angles, which was not possible on a spreadsheet. The team considered building its own data visualization tool, but Playlab Chief Growth Officer (CGO) Thomas Andreasen wanted his team to focus on designing and developing quality games. A primary consideration was finding a solution that could handle not only today\u2019s data deluge, but also could scale enough to manage future growth. \u201cWe went on the Internet searching for data visualization solutions and came across QlikView and Tableau among others,\u201d said Andreasen. \u201cWe then decided to go with Tableau because it fits our requirements better. We also have staff who have had some experience with Tableau,\u201d he added. Currently, the Playlab team regularly pulls data stored in Google BigQuery and PostgreSQL databases. There are also data stored as JSON and CSV files. They still use Flurry to pull the data from the different sources, then feed everything into Tableau to come up with easy-to-understand visualizations. On any given day, they could be analyzing over 10 million individual records. Furthermore, Playlab is exploring the use of Tableau beyond analyzing gameplay and enhancing the gaming experience. Staff in the Finance department, for instance, has also started to experiment with the software to analyze sales data. Andreasen estimates that the Playlab team has been benefitting from time savings of 200 to 300 percent since deploying Tableau. \u201cHow we worked with data was extremely manual before Tableau,\u201d Andresen commented. \u201cJust getting some information from the data then could take as long as 48 hours compared to about half an hour now with Tableau.\u201d \u201cTableau is a very easy to use visualization tool with drag and drop functions. You can visualize data in so many ways. This is especially useful in our game design as the charts can reveal if something is wrong in a split second, whereas in the past, we would have to look into the data of each level in a granular fashion to find errors and correct them,\u201d he said. With Tableau, Playlab is making it easier for its game designers to make correct evaluations on how to adapt and balance the game design by referring to insights gained from the data visualizations. Andreasen is pleased that the team found Tableau as it enables his staff to continue focusing on their primary efforts\u2014game design and improvement\u2014while enjoying access to data visualization to help them in the work. When asked what advice he has for organizations sourcing for a data analytics or visualization tool, Andreasen said it is important for them to be aware of how much their data might grow in the long run. He stressed that it is important that people work with analytics tools that can cope with a significantly larger amount of data, as their needs will likely evolve as their businesses grow."

In the Estonian pharmaceutical market, competition is high and shelf space is limited\u2014getting product stocked in premium supermarkets comes at a premium price. The Magnum Group wanted to improve decisions such as product placement, but limited business intelligence resources meant that information was closely-held within the senior management team. In this video, Business Development Project Manager, Alo Arro discusses how Magnum is now using Tableau to\u2014among other things\u2014make the most of their investments in shelf space. They are blending sales data with shelf layout specs from their operational systems to identify trends and differences between pharmacies. And data is now used across the company, helping people outside the senior management circle. Today, Tableau dashboards have helped The Magnum Group improve retail layouts and come up with a new store concept that is being rolled out across two countries. Tableau: Can you tell us about the Magnum Group? Alo Arro, Business Development Project Manager: I come from Magnum, which is the leading pharmaceutical wholesaler and retailers in the Baltics. We operate roughly 200 pharmacies of our own, and a couple of hundred franchises. Tableau: How did you get started with Tableau? Alo: My first Tableau analysis or Tableau visualization was a test of the hypothesis or a test of a proof of concept that we should tie our profitability data, heightened profitability data, and relate that to the amount of space we allocate to different product groups at our pharmacies. The amount of shelf space we have at premium locations is one of the biggest constraints we have. The competition among pharmacies is huge in Estonia. It's a ridiculous amount of money we have to pay to get into a premium supermarket. So the ability to use the space efficiently is, I think, quite crucial. Tableau: How did Tableau help you dig deeper into this issue? Alo: We pulled together our sales data or profitability data, and we pulled together our shelf layout specification, basically a few Excel files or CSV extracts from the operational systems, tied that together, added a couple of charts to see trends and differences between pharmacies. We got amazing insight from that and actually it started or help start a completely new initiative of renovating or renewing all of our pharmacies. We have actually developed a whole new pharmacy concept, which is now being implemented all over Estonia and Latvia, and this analysis was major input into that development. Tableau: Have there been any outstanding moments with Tableau? Alo: A real wow moment I think with Tableau was actually to see people growing from the organization and becoming Tableau analysts or Tableau developers. Tableau: Has there been a difference before and after Tableau? Alo: I think Tableau has actually helped open up the organization quite a bit. Before we had Tableau, most of the information was basically kept only through the senior management team. So I think now we are actually much more open and we're actually spreading information much more freely than we did before. And you have to keep in mind that we are an organization with no BI capabilities. A year and a half ago, we have no data warehouse, no BI team, and even no idea of what you can do with modern BI tools. So it really has been quite quick for us."

Ark Schools is committed to the idea that \u201call children deserve a great education,\u201d accepting children from unconventional economic and educational backgrounds. Leaders at Ark use data to determine program success and track student progress. The old process of compiling relevant data and building dashboards took months of effort from several departments. In video 2, Joshua Perry, Director of Program Support speaks about how Ark needed a system that was fast and flexible, so that teachers and leaders could use the data to affect daily decisions. To solve this need, Ark established a browser-based system on Tableau Server, where users can access analytics from almost anywhere. In video 1, Joshua describes how they built their \u201cgovernor dashboard\u201d in 2 minutes and 22 seconds and it continues to be a key visualization across the organization. Users can see a holistic view of the network of schools or drill down into an individual school to identify areas of opportunity or improvement. Tableau: What\u2019s your data storage situation and how does Tableau fit in? Joshua Perry, Director of Program Support: Our team has for many years now built and maintained systems that our schools use to understand data. We've improved and refined some of the techniques. But, essentially we have a data warehouse that takes data from all of our schools, from multiple systems. So we have something we call our governor dashboard and it's a key visualization within Ark. It shows people progress and attainment over time and our governing bodies and senior leaders use it to understand how our schools are doing. Now when we first built that, we built it in the way that we always used to build products and it took us around a month to build it. That's a month of elapsed time, but probably about a month of effort time when you add up all the people that contributed to that process. But the eureka moment for us was when we tried to recreate that in Tableau. And we have ourselves on video doing it and it took us 2 minutes and 22 seconds. Tableau: That\u2019s a dramatic difference. Joshua: If we can create visualizations in Tableau it's so much quicker, it's so much faster, and it will push us towards the best practice in what a report should look like, what will actually get great results from the users, and a better understanding of what that data is telling people. You're not just looking at it for fun. You're not just looking at it to create pretty pictures. You're looking at it to make different management decisions. Now why am I talking about that in the context of Tableau? It's because the visualization aspect of Tableau over what traditional tools have been able to provide in data\u2014where there's much more tabular data\u2014is that it just gets you to the conclusion much faster, and therefore what action you should take. And I think that's been hugely valuable to us, but I also think it's something we can bring to the wider education sector. Tableau: Tell us about Ark Schools. Joshua: Ark is an education organization with the purpose of transforming children's lives. We work in the UK and internationally. I guess what we're best known for is that we run schools as academies in the UK. We're international in our focus. But then alongside the schools, we also run education programs that have the goal of improving education outcomes. Tableau: How do you use Tableau? Joshua: So we use Tableau, my team builds and maintains some systems that all of our people in our schools network use to look at and understand data. Essentially the goal is to make it as simple as possible for users to not just understand the data\u2014which is what Tableau does\u2014but also to access the data. And Tableau is great for that too, through the Server functionality. Tableau: Who uses Tableau at Ark? Joshua: Our vizzes are used by, I think it's fair to say, literally everyone in the school's organization from trustees through to trainee teachers. So we have deliberately built our suite of Tableau reports so that in theory, the data that people are seeing really has to do with the level of aggregation that's appropriate for their role title. So if you're a trainee teacher, you're interested in data that has to do with the class that you're teaching right now and the relative progress of the people in that class. But, if you're a trustee you care about that detail. You just care about it in a greater level of aggregation. You care about what's happening across the network, but you still want to be able to drill down to see what's happening in an individual school or even further. Tableau: Where do people use Tableau? Joshua: Well, we produce as a team browser-based analytics tools that we deliver to all of our users\u2014whether they're in schools, or a central office, or wherever they are, as long as they have credentials to log in. So it may be that they're looking at it at home on a personal device. It may be that they're looking at it on a staff room, and like I say, as long as they know and understand their own secure credentials, they can use it either way. Tableau: Why is this flexibility so important? Joshua: That flexibility and where you can get access to the data is really important for our teachers, because as I've said this is really a tool that we want people to use to improve the outcomes for the children in their class. In order to do that, you need to have very regular access to that data. You need to be able to look at that data as you're planning curriculum for the next day, the next week, the next month, the next term. And you could be doing that from anywhere. So our teachers need to be able to get access to that data from anywhere. What that means for a teacher is when they're not in their classrooms, so when they're in a staff room or on their personal device, they can log in and they can see visualizations of their class data and act upon that information."

        "content": "EMC helps diverse companies work with big data and make the jump to cloud computing. The company gathers a great deal of data about customer experiences from surveys, forums, and simply from the day-to-day interactions. While planning for the EMC's upcoming annual conference, EMC World, a company leader challenged the Customer Experience group to help customers understand how they use that data to deliver improved experiences. Oh, and two more things: the demonstration should be interactive. And it should be cool. So Director of Global Quality for the Total Customer Experience Group, Jenny Beazley, and Consultant Program Manager for CS Analytics, Steve Scales turned to Tableau. With Tableau\u2014and a couple of touchscreens\u2014they were able to create an interactive data experience at the EMC World booth. Customers could intuitively build their own visualizations in seconds, while booth workers could point out how EMC is using the data to further enhance the customer experience with EMC. Tableau: How has Tableau helped with customer service?\nJenny Beazley, Director of Global Quality, Total Customer Experience Group: In May we had a big event, EMC World. It runs every year, and it showcases our new products, and how we work in the organization to our customers. So our Vice President of Total Customer Experience, Carolyn Muise, came to us with a directive this year saying that she wanted it to be interactive in our TCE booth. She wanted us to show and demonstrate to our customers how we're using data to drive continuous improvement to their experience with us. And she wanted it to be cool. So Tableau was the first thing to pop into my mind. Steve Scales, Consultant Program Manager for CS Analytics: We did several different visualizations for EMC World. So we had big touchscreen televisions where the customers could come up. And then they could interact with their data, the data that we have for our customers, and they could drill in and do different things with the data on those screens. We wanted them to walk up and just do it intuitively. And that's what Tableau was able to do for us. Tableau: What was the reaction?\nJenny: The customers loved the analytics experience center. It drew them in, just seeing the flashing colors on the screen. We used the Pages feature in Tableau to really capture their attention. And as they were using the dashboards, we were able to step in and interject with their interactions on the screens, work with them to talk about how we were improving their experience based on data that they fed back to us in the form of surveys, forums, and data that we just capture with our day-to-day interactions with our customers. It made me feel really proud, proud of the work that Steve and I had developed in Tableau, proud of the look and feel of the booth, proud of showing our customers what we did with their data to drive improvement."

        "company": "SuperData",
        "content": "SuperData is a privately-held market intelligence research provider specializing in the video game sector. With customers ranging from Wargaming and Trion to payment firms and game publishers, SuperData has become a go-to source for learning what\u2019s up in the gaming world. The startup, founded in 2009, found that an Excel-based product simply couldn\u2019t scale efficiently when the job at hand is to crunch data from more than 40 million video gamers each month. And customers had to work to dig the insights out of the multi-spreadsheet reports. After testing their concept with an open-source business intelligence solution, SuperData chose Tableau and Amazon Redshift for its Arcade gaming intelligence product. Today, customers can log into Arcade (in Tableau Server) from any browser. Once in, customers can securely interact with intuitive data visualizations that delight both existing and prospective customers alike. And it\u2019s not just customers enjoying the change. SuperData analysts can now work faster\u2014freeing up time to answer more interesting questions. Each month, the SuperData team collects, cleans and aggregates transactional data from nearly 40 million paying gamers. The data is gathered directly from the game companies themselves. \u201cData providers share anonymously and learn about the industry that\u2019s relevant to them,\u201d explains Sam Barberie, VP of Product and Business Development at SuperData. Analysts combine the transactional data with relevant data from other sources. From there, they develop tailored models that deliver reports, which speak to the broader industry. As a small company\u2014SuperData employs fewer than 50 people\u2014working efficiently with big data is crucial. Unfortunately, the analyst team\u2019s Microsoft Excel-based process was not as efficient as Sam would like. \u201cDelivering just the standard data sets\u2014no custom work, just custom splices of existing data\u2014would take a full day of an analyst\u2019s time to ship out,\u201d explains Sam. And as a rapidly growing start-up, the team at SuperData needed to free up time for more strategic efforts. \u201cAs we scale the business, we want to spend more time on models and custom research rather than on putting together things in spreadsheets,\u201d Sam says. And while some of SuperData\u2019s customers are extremely technically-savvy, with advanced Excel skills, others were far less interested in crunching data to understand the content. \u201cSome of our customers don\u2019t want to leaf through hundreds of thousands of data points to figure it out,\u201d Sam notes. This was particularly true for prospective clients. \u201cIt was hard when we would say, \u2018Here are ten different spreadsheets with samples across different platforms and areas of the industry.\u2019 And it would be up to them to leaf through it and see what kinds of insights they could pull from it,\u201c he says. The team at SuperData began to look for a solution to engage both current and prospective clients. One important consideration was ensuring the data would be seen only by authorized people. \u201cData security is huge for us. We use every industry standard to keep the data secure,\u201d explains Sam. Initially, the team looked at Tableau, in part because many of their clients were already using Tableau in their own organizations. At the time, Tableau seemed like a more robust investment than SuperData was ready to make on an untested idea. Instead, they opted to build out a Beta solution using the open source solution, Pentaho. \u201cIt proved the case internally\u2014we knew this approach could drive things forward,\u201d says Sam. \u201cBut we quickly realized the limits of Pentaho meant we wouldn\u2019t take this as far we wanted.\u201d The team reevaluated Tableau and decided they were ready to make the jump. \u201cWe seemed to have the bandwidth on the client side and lack of bandwidth on the analyst side in terms of how much more they could scale building these custom Excel spreadsheets. It was the tipping point.\u201d The SuperData team developed Arcade, game data intelligence reports built in Tableau. For the first major iteration and for a few substantial changes, the team relied on Tableau partner USEReady. \u201cThey are experts and immediately grasped what we wanted,\u201d says Sam. Today, SuperData analysts author visualizations in Tableau Desktop. They connect to data stored in Amazon Redshift using Tableau\u2019s native data connector. Analysts then publish completed dashboards and vizzes to Tableau Server, where customers and internal users can log on to view and interact with the data. \u201cArcade is a web-based dashboard. People log in with their ID and password, and then have access to either the entire offering or whatever splices or platforms they have subscribed to,\u201d says Sam. \u201cJust having the knowledge that a lot of our clients were already using Tableau, and knowing they trust their data with it was comforting. Because they really guard that stuff!\u201d he says. Since adopting Tableau, the team at SuperData has seen a number of benefits including:"

Its goal is to report current events, explore topics of interest, and deliver information to the public. The media group stands for freedom of information and decisiveness of action. The increase of digitalization brings risks and opportunities alike, and the media industry is no exception. The NZZ data analysis team, led by Markus Barmettler, used a Microsoft Excel-based reporting solution in combination with ad-hoc analysis when necessary. In October 2014, the team replaced its system in an effort to be able to quickly react to market opportunities and chose to migrate to a modern Tableau solution. Today, 35 people in the marketing and product departments use Tableau analyses and dashboards to: Markus Barmettler, Head of Analytics and Market Research at the NZZ competence center for data-driven and analytical value generation, says the user feedback is positive: \u201cWe highly appreciate the flexibility, simplicity, and performance of our new Tableau solution.\u201d Before the NZZ team could reap the rewards of new and profitable insights, it needed to redefine and automate its in-house data collection process. \u201cAs we were coming from an Excel-based reporting system, we needed to first set up a data warehouse,\u201d says Barmettler. \u201cOnce we had laid that foundation, though, we were ready to go. With Tableau Desktop, we were able to efficiently explore our data after just one day of introduction.\u201d NZZ regularly analyzes a variety of local and online data sources based on SQL Server, IBM BigInsights, Adobe Analytics, flat Excel files, Amazon S3, and Apache Spark on Amazon EMR, among others. Tableau brings flexibility and a range of capabilities, adding value to the NZZ on a daily basis. \u201cThe main advantage is how efficiently we can do our daily data analysis work. Tableau offers a wealth of native connectors for various data sources. You can also combine data, or do data extracts, which helps a lot in speeding up ad-hoc analysis. It\u2019s all very efficient,\u201d says Barmettler. The successful implementation of the new analytics solution inspired NZZ to plan an expansion and start its own training program to build up the skills of its staffers. \u201cOur goal is to enable each department to independently perform their own ad-hoc analyses. In short, we are aiming for self-service BI. This will make us even faster and help us to retain or even increase our edge over the competition,\u201d says Barmettler. Being able to use native connectors to connect to virtually any data source and make everything available for analysis, was a welcomed feature of Tableau. \u201cHaving Tableau as great tool for quickly analysing new data sources is extremely helpful. We don\u2019t have to set up a whole ETL process to gain insights from the data. Now we verify the value of the data first and only then automate data processing and integrate it into our data warehouse,\u201d adds Barmettler. Using this method, Barmettler\u2019s team recently discovered the high-value of download counters and usage statistics of their ePapers offered online. This information hadn\u2019t been considered all too important before. Integrating Tableau into the automated analytics processes allowed the team to generate daily insights about its target audience and their preferences."

Estamos Juntos works with clients from a variety of industries including government, insurance, and banking. In this video, Carlos Sampaio, Partner at Estamos Juntos discusses how they have used Tableau on their projects in Angola. In video 1, Carlos speaks about how Estamos Juntos uses Tableau in their project with the social security ministry in Angola. In video 2, Carlos explains how Tableau is accessible and easy to learn. The training period is short, allowing clients to make their own reports in minutes\u2014with beautiful results. Tableau: Tell us a little about where you work? Carlos Sampaio, Partner, Estamos Juntos: Our area of work right now is Angola. We are expanding to other African countries in the near future. Maybe later it will go to other regions, but for now, we are centered in Africa. Tableau: Can you describe your current project? Carlos: In this particular project, we were working for the Ministry of Employment and Social Security in Angola. So they are building this concept, all the structure of social security to cover a region that has over 20 million people. Angola is a country that suffered from a very long and hard civil war for 30 years. The concept of social security for us is something that we take for granted. But there it's something new. People are really starting to have hope in the future. Tableau: And how does Tableau fit into this project? Carlos: So those who are learning, those who are making, those who are seeing in all the hierarchy of that institution, really love Tableau for everything that Tableau has given to them. And it's very gratifying to see that with Tableau, we are actually doing something to meet those hopes of those people. Those people now go to work; they are not afraid to leave home to go to work. And they know that when they retire, they will have an institute, an organization, government organization that is managing their money that will provide security in the future. Tableau is part of this. People don't know that, of course, that's transparent for the people, but it's there. It's providing the knowledge to make this organization trusted and robust, and this really has a positive impact in this country. Tableau: What has the response been to your work in Tableau? Carlos: We believe that Africa has a great margin of progression for Tableau. We are a tailored software company. We work mainly for Angolan market. We develop projects of great scale for the government of Angola. Tableau: Why did you choose Tableau? Carlos: Tableau has some amazing characteristics that we all know very well. And they apply very well in Africa. It's simple to use. Anyone can use it. Even someone without a technical profile may use it. And we can see that whenever we show a proof of concept, whenever we show a new chart that we make, a new report, when we train people, when people make their own report in two minutes, and they say, \"Wow, I did this in two minutes. I don't understand anything of business intelligence, but I was able to make a beautiful report showing the payments of pensions to the people. I made that in two minutes, and the result is beautiful.\u201d Tableau: What makes Tableau unique in a market like Angola? Carlos: Less is more. And in Angola, this is more important than usually. They really want something simple and relevant. They don't want visual pollution. So instead of making complex reports, we make many simple reports. So they only show the information that matters, so it's not in great volume. It's not very complex, they load very easily, and that's also important. Tableau: In your opinion, what is one of the biggest benefits? Carlos: They have this independence in terms of capability to produce. And that's very important there too, because they really value this kind of independence."

Founded in 2001, the company boasts a yearly revenue of more than CHF 230 million, delivering services to customers such as Swisscom, Manor and Sanitas. Moritz Schneider leads Operations within their Interactive Team. Staffed with approximately 20 people, this team is responsible for providing online ad campaign services from consulting, planning, and execution, to analytics and reporting. Mediaschneider collects large amounts of media data, including web and social media campaign metrics. Previously, employees tracked these metrics in complex spreadsheets\u2014leading to a time-consuming reporting process. \u201cIn the online sector, we are receiving current server data regarding impressions, click, and conversion rates of our web and social media campaigns at virtually the push of a single button. However, processing and report generation for our clients used to be time-consuming and prone to errors, because we were doing it using large and complex Excel spreadsheets,\u201d says Moritz Schneider, Head of Team Interactive. The ad-server hosters provided a wide variety of KPIs, but the team felt that the calculations from which they were based weren\u2019t always trustworthy. Consequently, Mediaschneider decided to implement their own data warehouse to consolidate all the relevant data for online campaigns and run their own, independent KPI calculations. Mediaschneider secured the support of D1 Solutions, a Tableau partner. As Moritz Schneider had already had a positive experience using Tableau during his marketing studies, and there was a huge amount of data to report and visualize, they decided to implement a Tableau solution. After initial performance problems with the on-premise IT, Mediaschneider decided to use the Amazon Redshift cloud infrastructure to build their data warehouse. \u201cAs of today, we have no idea where we might be able to go with this in the future,\u201d says Schneider. \u201cFor now, we are only storing online campaign data for our reporting in there. But if we see good results, we would love to also integrate the other media sectors: TV, radio, cinema and print. The virtually limitless scalability of a cloud infrastructure is the ideal basis for that. And Tableau can handle all sorts of online and offline data sources anyway.\u201d But the Swiss media expert is aiming even higher: \"Going forward, we want to enable our customers to immediately evaluate the success of their campaigns. With cross-channel analysis, for example, they could determine the most successful campaigns and channels, allowing them to plan and use their marketing budgets more efficiently. These kind of services aren't offered at any media agency at this moment. It would go a long way towards increasing customer retention for us.\" Tableau Cloud allows Mediaschneider employees to quickly access large amounts of data on the web\u2014speeding up report generation and increasing productivity. \u201cUsing Tableau Cloud, we can provide internal and external users alike with quick web access, without worrying about capacities or CPU performance. My team makes sure we deliver dashboards that provide exactly the information, KPIs and interactive analyses needed. Compared to the report preparation in Excel we used to do, this frees up significant amounts of time and capacity we can direct towards new challenges,\u201d says Schneider."

With Tableau, ExxonMobil has: In video 1, above, data quality advisor John Ossege and data analyst Ebony Weddington discuss how they are \u201cputting the power back into the users\u2019 hands\u201d by sharing dashboards on Tableau Server. In video 2, John shares how an intern was able to create a data quality dashboard for management\u2014with no prior Tableau knowledge. Tableau: What has Tableau done for ExxonMobil? Ebony Weddington, Data Analyst: Tableau gives us the ability to instantly see those problem areas. So time saving is just huge. Tableau: How would you describe your data needs? Ebony: We want to ensure that our engineers and our geoscientists have quality data that's readily available so that they can go off and make key business decisions that are going to affect our entire corporation. Tableau: How do you make your data readily available? John Ossege, Data Quality Advisor: We had this thing that we started called our Gallery of Dashboards. When we build a dashboard we put it out in our gallery. It's just out there on the server. And everybody that we have trained up in our roll out period, they can have access to those dashboards. So they can pull them off the server, take them, and do whatever they want to them. We strongly encourage that. Tableau: What led you to Tableau? Ebony: Our previous tool, our users wanted more flexibility. They wanted something that was easier to use, something more intuitive. John: So we went out and started looking, and that's when we discovered Tableau and we started using it. Ebony: We have a project area that we've created that we store our dashboards within our data quality center of excellence, and we support those dashboards. So we publish them out to the Tableau Server. Tableau: How does Tableau empower people to use data? Ebony: We can give them an actor role where they can actually go out and interact with the dashboard. They can pretty much utilize all the filtering, they can see the underlying data, which is really important. We're putting the power back into the user's hand. It's not just us doing this, 'we're going to give you licenses,' but you'll be able to go in, you'll be able to tweak the dashboard, you'll be able to edit it. So it's not like it's a stale report that you can't touch . They're able to go in. They can customize. They can do whatever they need to do to meet the requirements of their business. John: Let me give you a perfect story about this. We taught some people in Buenos Aires on our basic rollout how to go ahead and build dashboards. And we showed them our basic dashboards and we didn't hear from them. A couple of weeks went by. Part of our rollout philosophy is we want constant communication with our customers so we can monitor their progress and help them get over any hurdles. So we finally got a hold of them they said, well, we kind of built a dashboard. We said, well, can we see it? And we called it up and we looked at it and it didn't look anything like the one we had created. But, man, was it powerful. It sat there and it had everything they needed to do and the answer was instant, right. The guy looked at me and he goes, you know, by using this dashboard we estimate we're going to save 95 percent of our time. And I thought about that for a minute and I used to basically do what they're doing now and I believe that's really an accurate number, because here's what they had to do. Tableau: What were they dealing with before? John: They had to sit there and run a report from the corporate repository. The report was not user-friendly. They then had to take that report and put it into Excel. They had to clean it up. I mean excess rows of dashes, multiple header lines, clean all that up, then they took it into Access and from Access they went ahead and ran their queries against it and got their information. All that goes away. All we've got to do is get our data out of the application, out of the repository, put it into Tableau, the dashboard is built, numbers are right there. It saves 95 percent of their time. Tableau: What would you say is the strongest aspect of Tableau? John: I think one of the real strengths of dashboarding in Tableau is the visualization aspect. Let me give you a perfect example. And this addresses a lot of areas. We brought in a summer intern back in late May/early June. He had never even heard of Tableau. We explained to him what we were doing, and we asked him to actually work with our end users, our data consumers. So as soon as he'd pick up a little bit about Tableau, understood what we were doing, looked at the dashboards we designed, we were ready to take that next step. And so he went over, and he started working with the data consumers, and he asked them, \"what it is you want to see in a dashboard?\" Tableau: Can you tell us more about this project? John: One of the things that came back was they wanted to see a summation. Instead of running like 17 or 18 different business rules, and I'm looking at \"is this data is clean, this data is valid, this data needs work\"\u2014management doesn't have time to look at all that information. They're mostly concerned about just show me the result. So what our intern did was he went ahead and took a weighted average of all the individual tests and produced one number, and that number represented the quality over a given area, and this would be geographic area. This was in the Gulf of Mexico. He then went and got what we call lease blocks into the Gulf of Mexico. He plotted that on a map. Then he took all the work he had done in Tableau and he had it now down to one number, which represented the percent, converted it to color, plotted that color inside those blocks. Tableau: That's awesome! What impact has that had on the company? John: So now management can take a look at this map, and they can see exactly where the data quality problems are and the overall quality of all the data in the Gulf of Mexico. Ebony: This dashboard has become the tool of choice for them to monitor how well they're doing on that project and that data cleanup initiative, as well as in the future on monitoring how they're doing from a data quality standpoint. So it's been key there. John: The most important thing that everyone in support that can give management is more time. So I can save them tens of minutes just by looking at this one display and they can realize exactly either where the good data is, or the bad data is. Tableau: What do you use for data integration? Ebony: So right now, within this particular rollout, we're primarily using Oracle. Oracle connections. And that has been really helpful because it's allowing us to connect to Oracle, have the data in there, but visually we're able to see the data. Tableau: How has data analysis changed over the course of your career? John: I've been working in data for a long time and I mean I was working back when we had to sit there and go into huge rooms and pull up reports and look for things. It took a long, long time. Well, fast forward about 10 or 20 years. Here we are today. We've got this stuff right at our fingertips just like that. It's incredibly rewarding to see where we have come and what the future is going to bring."

        "content": "Mappy is a software publisher that largely focuses on cartography. Mappy designs maps, calculates routes with directions for cars, public transportation, bicycles and on foot, and enables users to search for points of interest, restaurants, hotels and shops via the Internet, from a tablet, cell phone, or a GPS device. Visualizing data is important to understand what Mappy\u2019s 10 million unique users are doing each month and how the data behaves. Every day at Mappy, around a dozen people need to find answers to questions about the product, features, and more. For example, Mappy\u2019s analysts needed to look at how users behave, how many times a point of interest (POI) is viewed on a map, the number of times that users click on a point, and even how many times the POI address is shown. With 4 million POIs available on Mappy, the team\u2019s ability to answer questions was quickly outstripped by new requests. The previous system used was long, complicated, and tedious. The team knew it needed to rethink how Mappy was collecting, viewing, and understanding data. \u201cIn the past, we were doing BI like in the 1980s. We used a processing chain with the server logs composed of an aggregation stage written in Python. The aggregated data was then stored on Microsoft SQL Server. To visualize the data, we used Excel, which pointed to SQL server cubes that we had to recompile every night. This process added hours, if not days, to data analysis. Finally, PDF exports were created so analysts could have a direct image in order to visualize the data\u201d \u2013 Nicolas Korchia, Business Manager. Each day this represented 150 GB of data produced by the company\u2019s 120 operational servers. Faced with this continually increasing volume of data, Mappy had reached the upper limit of its vertical scalability with its old system. The platform needed a major redevelopment. The Business Intelligence Manager decided to take a radical turn that would enable analysts to obtain and visualize data in a simple and effective way. Mappy completely overhauled its system\u2014moving from a SQL Server platform to a Hadoop platform coupled with Spark SQL. This redesign made it possible to speed up processing of queries submitted through Mappy. During the redesign, the issue of data visualization cropped up. They needed to find a solution that would integrate easily with the system. \u201cTableau is well known and, as a result, it has very quickly appeared in the top 10 solutions on Benchmarker. We asked Actinvision, a company that specializes in implementing solutions, to help with decision-making. They were quick to recommend we use Tableau.\u201d Actinvision provided the Business Intelligence Manager at Mappy with the necessary means for testing the solution. After this test period and handover, Tableau became the obvious choice,\u201d says Nicolas. \u201cTableau was quick and easy to implement. After the skills transfer, members of the Mappy team were able to become independent very quickly,\u201d adds Olivier Catherin, Chairman and CEO of Actinvision There are about ten Mappy employees using Tableau today. Some come from the technical department, the analysts, and others are more on the business side\u2014people who are asking questions about the product and its features. \u201cI provide the tools that will allow them to answer questions by themselves, and this is what Tableau is allowing them to do right now,\" said Nicolas Korchia, Business Intelligence Manager at Mappy. Tableau was very quick to install. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly intuitive tool, so users can be trained to use it very easily and independently. In less than one week, we managed to upload incredibly interesting visualizations,\u201d Nicolas says. \u201cFor us, visualizing data is important, so we can understand what our users do and how our data behaves.\u201d In the video below, Oliver Catherin, President and CEO of Actinvision, talks about partnering with Tableau With Tableau, Mappy has improved the way it visualizes data. \"We\u2019ve saved a lot of time. Since changing system, moving to a Hadoop platform which allowed us to prepare the data and Tableau on Dataviz on top of that, my business team is completely independent.\u201d Tableau users can find their own way through the masses of data. \u201cThey no longer have to ask me questions because they\u2019re directly connected to the data. Users are a lot freer with Tableau, it\u2019s much easier, looks better and works a lot faster!\u201d On a daily basis, understanding data becomes much more fun for the users. Naturally, they are looking for new answers and asking new questions, which wasn't possible with the older, complicated system. \u201cFollowing performance metrics and the results of automatic tests or worse still, understanding 4 million POIs, well, it\u2019s not much of a laugh. Now with Tableau, it\u2019s become much more fun.\u201d Users want to create new visualizations, create new dashboards that make it possible to draw many more conclusions about the data and gain a much better understanding of how Mappy is being used. \u201cThe data is interesting now, people are no longer frightened\u2014quite the opposite in fact, people are willingly using this data.\u201d"

        "content": "Decision Resources Group (DRG) helps pharmaceutical and medical technology companies manage and use their data. DRG is an OEM partner that embeds Tableau into its products. Before Tableau, the DRG team was looking for a tool that was flexible and easy to use\u2014but powerful enough to handle their technical needs. In this video, Chief Data Officer Brigham Hyde speaks about how Tableau has helped DRG: Tableau: What are the data challenges of your job? Brigham Hyde, Chief Data Officer: One of the key factors for us is how to continue to communicate value to our clients. It's no longer good enough just to have the data and leave them with the responsibility of turning it into value. And we're constantly looking for ways to respond to their questions and come up with new solutions for them. Tableau gives us a great way to do that. We do a lot of rapid prototyping of ideas with clients in Tableau and customize many deliverables through it. Tableau: Tell us more about your company. Brigham: Decision Resources Group is a healthcare information firm. We provide unique and valuable data to broad pharmaceutical companies and medical technology companies and the life science industry. We also advise our clients, through service engagements or consulting engagements, and we provide report content. Tableau: What led you to Tableau? Brigham: I think first, we wanted to look at having a tool that was formidable enough to handle our technical needs: both rigorous quantitative models and statistical power, but also the ability to play with the data and explore different hypotheses quickly. And of course, really easy to use, easy to adopt, click and drag sort of modern feel to the application. Tableau: So you\u2019ve found Tableau easy to use? Brigham: It's very quick to engage. You can get quickly to deployment. And there was just a lot of satisfaction on the analyst's part when that happened, and there were a lot of instant fans, I would say. Tableau: What are some of your main uses of Tableau? Brigham: We're a product company, and in some cases, we need to use Tableau to create products. The OEM system within Tableau is fantastic for that. You know, scalability and again, ease of entrance, make it something that doesn't have to be the Magna Carta of deals to get started. But there's support to expand as you need to and as you need to grow. So I think they've been great on flexibility and helping us figure out how to adapt rapidly and keep pace with our users who start to create things really fast, as soon as you give them the Desktop licenses. Our clients' reactions that moment where you reveal your dashboard\u2014it's like revealing a work of art that you've created. I think we can really communicate complex ideas with them. And we've talked about a wow factor. Usually their reaction is, \"How'd you do that?\" Tableau: What were the data needs of people at DRG? Brigham: Having analysts in the healthcare space that are extremely quantitative, the things that they focused on were: having the capability to do the high-end analyses they wanted to do, the analytical models, the statistical packages, but also being able to experiment with data. Tableau: And how would describe the impact of Tableau? Brigham: The impact that Tableau has had on the health industry, I would say to date, it has started to take us out of the Stone Age. Healthcare suffers from different data challenges than other big data areas: siloed data kept separate, historically and by regulation\u2014and now needing to blend and combine data sources and solve complex problems. The ability to get rapid prototypes, test hypotheses, and explore data is almost as critical as the ultimate analysis. We spend a lot of time focusing on predicting how disease treatment will be carried out, and whether or not a drug is going to work. Tableau enabled me to do things that turned that power over to the user. So focusing on your assumptions and the quality of those in the medical sphere as opposed to just the numbers, and spending your time on those key details as opposed to working with the data ad nauseam is a much better use of time. Tableau: How does Tableau compare to other programs and tools? Brigham: I think a lot of database tools really lack that play factor, which is where a lot of great ideas come from. That and the user experience being very click and drop and modern gave it advantages not only over the way we were doing things, but over other BI tools that we tried. Tableau: Did Tableau spread within the company? Brigham: Something we saw organically having multiple BI tools, no matter what we tried to make them do, they migrated to Tableau, and you've got to listen to the people. Tableau: What makes Tableau so person-friendly? Brigham: I think the reason that Tableau is the people's champion if you will, is that you get an easy win right away. Everybody can make a dashboard in the first 30 minutes, without having to know complex database technology or without having to know completely the data inside and out from a domain perspective. So there's a rewarding feeling of making your first dashboard. And I think after that, the reason it sticks is that the transparency of the tool lets people explore things and learn on their own. So to a certain level there's not much training that's required, people teach themselves, and I think those two things make it really satisfying to use. Tableau: Was communicating with clients a factor too? Brigham: Yes. Being experts in the healthcare arena but having to use advanced modeling techniques through Excel and other database programs, we sought a better way to communicate our results to our clients."

His company and Tableau Alliance partner, Key Data Consulting helps clients find data solutions for their business needs. Dave also uses Tableau in his personal life, collecting data for his competitive dragon boat team, the Manly Dragons, hailing from Manly, Australia. The Manly Dragons have succeeded in a variety of competitions, including the Australian Dragon Boat National Championships in Perth, where they won eight gold, six silver, and three bronze medals. The Manly Dragons use tracking devices to measure paddling power, twisting, angles, and speed. They visualize the data in Tableau Public and share it amongst team members. With Tableau, the team identifies areas of improvement and makes adjustments to their technique\u2014a process that helps them succeed in world-class championships. Tableau: Can you speak about how your dragon boat team is using data? Dave Keys, Principal: Our club, Manly Dragons, we've now had gold medals at two consecutive club crew world dragon boat championships. One of the challenges we had was moving away from gut feel on how we should be coaching and getting into something that was a bit more scientific. Tableau: How did you move towards a more scientific approach? Dave: I joined the committee and we started spending a little bit of money on buying devices that measure things like paddle, how much power is being applied on a paddle, twist, what angle the paddle's at, also speed on the boat, so we measure what the boat's doing. We're now going through a process of iteratively taking that data and using it to tell us more about the way that we're able to improve our paddling technique and get better starts and individualized training for individual athletes. Tableau: How are you visualizing that data in Tableau? Dave: We\u2019ve now got a visualization we're using that allows us to compare and contrast different paddlers and the way that they're doing padding technique It makes it much easier to let that paddler know how they're doing something that might be right or wrong, and to let them visualize what they're doing. Tableau's the best tool for visualizing this sort of data. Tableau: What has been the biggest benefit of using Tableau Public? Dave: Return on investment for our club is quite huge, because we're using Tableau Public, so we're able to put the results from our analysis in sports science and publishing it on Tableau Public and that doesn't cost our club anything. Tableau: Have you received positive reactions from your Tableau Public vizzes? Dave: We're also now getting a lot of feedback from other people that are interested in what we're doing. We've got a university that's interested in using some of the data we're collecting for their sports science fourth year student studies. Tableau: Where would you be without these Tableau visualizations? Dave: Without Tableau we would not be where we are in terms of the way we're taking the data and turning it into a sports science project. We can apply the science behind the data and make it so that the club members can see how we can improve as a club. And as a result of that, we can see noticeable improvement on a lot of the things we're doing in our sport. There\u2019s no other product comes near it from my perspective. We'd still be in the old style coaching where the coach would be running on gut feel. We've turned it into something where we're applying sport science to the way we're training as a team, to the way we're looking at individual paddlers, to the way we're starting our races and coming up with individual training routines for individual paddlers. It's changed the way we're doing things.  Tableau: Can you give an overview of your experience with Tableau? Dave: I think that Tableau is the best tool around for making the data talk to you in an easy-to-use way. I first bought Tableau in August 2007, version 3, and I've been using it ever since. I've been a partner more recently, and I've used it across so many different use cases\u2014it's nuts. And there's no other product comes near it from my perspective. Tableau: How does your company approach data? Dave: Our focus is taking data and making sense of the data, and using the data with Tableau to come out with new insights. So we transform what for a lot of companies and sporting organizations is unintelligible data and we make it something that's very useful and can be used to drive actions. Tableau: What has been your biggest \u201ca-ha\u201d moment in Tableau? Dave: There have been a lot of \u201ca-ha\u201d moments. I enjoy some of the types of graphs that we can produce with Tableau. Tree maps are a favorite of mine. They allow me to pull data out in ways and change the way we're looking at data for different clients so that they haven't seen something like it before. The color coding, I did a Stephen Few course not long ago about visualization best practices, and Tableau just does that stuff second nature. It's been built to incorporate those sorts of things in. So we're getting very good value out of it from that point of view Tableau: Has the partnership been a good experience so far? Dave: I'm finding Tableau an excellent partnership. I'm working with a couple of the sales girls and they're great to work with. We make a good strong team, I think."

Michael Conroy, Head of Insight and Innovation: Tempero is a global company. We have clients and staff in about 50 different countries around the world. So I guess the availability of Tableau Cloud and the way that we work works really well together. Tableau: What was your goal when you first started using Tableau? Michael: One of the things we really wanted to do with Tableau was reduce the amount of static reporting that we did. The PowerPoint slides, Excel worksheets, all that sort of thing, because we were doing some PowerPoint slides\u2014PowerPoints that were hundreds of slides long. Tableau: How did you solve that with Tableau Cloud? Michael: The way that we make Tableau Cloud the center of what we do and the way that we deliver it to clients is we publish it directly to them and they actually log on and have a look at the views that we've created for them. And so rather than, for example a client that has 22 markets and hundreds of products needing a hundreds of slides report, we now have one view and then we can facilitate diving into that data with the interactivity that Tableau offers. Tableau: What does that client experience look like in Tableau Cloud? Michael: Clients log on. They play around with the data. It's actually resulted in something that's more like a conversation around the data, rather than just sending a report out. Tableau: How long did it take to put together all of those static reports? Michael: That could take us two weeks to put together, in terms of getting all the data together and then visualizing it all, and also running the analysis and then delivering that. Now we can do that in a couple of hours\u2014maybe even two hours. Tableau: Wow, you\u2019ve saved a lot of time! How else has Tableau changed that process? Michael: So rather than broadcasting a report out to them and saying, \u201chere's your report, here's your 100 slides, get back to us in a month when you've read it.\u201d What we do now is we invite them into the office, we put Tableau Cloud up on the screen and we're like, \u201cokay, here is the data that you asked us to prepare for you.\u201d That's been a really important development for us and it's really improved the relationship that we have with our clients."

Data prep for one report could take up to a day and results were hard to read and inflexible. The bank embarked on a proof of concept with Tableau, turning to Inekon Systems, Czech and Slovak Tableau Partner, for help with technical consultation and training. Today with Tableau, Komer\u010dn\u00ed banka can: The analytics team at Komer\u010dn\u00ed banka spent a great deal of time analyzing and reporting data for use by various business units. For example, creating an analysis of new and lost clients\u2014a regular report for the marketing department\u2014took many steps. The team first had to prepare data through SQL queries, aggregate it, and then consolidate and analyze the results in Microsoft Excel. This took a full day. Even then, the final results were far from user-friendly. To actually answer business questions, employees needed to be able to use advanced Excel functions, such as pivot tables. Decision makers struggled to understand the analytics reports. And answering ad-hoc questions was nearly impossible, as analyses were limited to the data identified in the initial query\u2014following hunches or looking into outliers was often impossible without an additional reporting request. Decisions were delayed, as teams struggled to understand the spreadsheets or waited for additional analyses. \u201cThere were up to several weeks of delays between analytical data processing and management decision-making,\u201d says Karel \u0160taud, Business Insight expert at Komer\u010dn\u00ed banka. The analytics team heard about Tableau and decided to tackle a real project during the free trial period. \u201cIt was important for us not to only thoroughly get to know the system, but especially to try it out on a real pilot project that would run at least for several weeks and that would have serious predictive value,\u201d Karel explains. He and his team decided to bring in a partner, Inekon Systems, to help them with this. Inekon Systems helped Karel\u2019s team extend the free trial to complete a full proof-of-concept. Inekon Systems also offered technical consultation and user training for users of various levels. \u201cI consider these trainings, in particular, to be very helpful,\u201d says Karel. Inekon trainers worked with business users who would view and interact with completed dashboards published to Tableau Server. They also took advantage of more in-depth training for employees responsible for building the visual analysis dashboards in Tableau Desktop. \u201cWe created a relatively simple report that provided clear and cogent information on the growth of the number of our clients, the popularity of our products and attractiveness of accompanying services,\u201d explains Karel. The analytics team was pleased that Tableau allowed them to connect directly to databases through an online connection. This allowed the team to avoid the heavy hardware requirements of a data warehouse. The team gave the Tableau analysis to several managers, who responded positively. These managers quickly got used to such regular, easy-to-understand results. \u201cAfter the end of the free trial license, it was then much easier to justify the purchase of the software,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, leading managers and analysts can simply and easily investigate various decision-making\nvariants during a single meeting, because they can get the necessary answers in real time,\u201d Karel says. The analytics team has expanded its use of Tableau, tackling a new project: marketing campaign reporting. They have created analyses that show which campaigns are under preparation and which campaigns are currently running. It also visualizes campaign sizes and targets, which products they promote and more. This analysis helps managers understand how to prioritize campaigns, identify where campaigns might overlap or even compete with one another, and judge campaign success. The campaign committee now uses this report to decide which projects will continue and which will be realized at all. \u201cWe have discovered new, previously unknown potential in the tool,\u201d says Karel. \u201cIf there has ever been a system that provides its users with outputs they can easily understand, accept and present, then that system is Tableau.\u201d Overall, Komer\u010dn\u00ed banka is enjoying a number of benefits from its decision to work with Tableau and Inekon Systems, including: Faster analyses. The analytics team can create data analyses much faster than before\u2014Karel estimates that a comparable analysis is completed in just \u201ca few tens of minutes.\u201d Deeper, more fun analysis processes. Karel says that Tableau\u2019s ease of use, visualization functions and continuous displaying of results has \u201ctruly changed the way of thinking of everyone who became familiar with Tableau.\u201d For instance, analysts can now assess the meaningfulness of a query or answer basic questions much faster. They can also operatively adjust monitored KPIs so that the results can really tell the whole story. Self-service. Business users are not simply handed the answer to a question, but rather can interact with visualizations to ask more questions for deeper understanding. \u201cHe or she can apply filters, remove or add data or display additional details, all on his or her own,\u201d says Karel. And while the data interaction is much more in-depth than before, employees are finding the process much simpler. \u201cIf you know how to browse the internet, then you are capable of working with Tableau analyses,\u201d says Karel. The easy-to-navigate, interactive tables often inspire managers to reach conclusions that would never be attainable from an Excel table, Karel notes."

After introducing Tableau, they found that business users and analysts enjoyed the speed and flexibility of Tableau dashboards. After successfully testing Tableau on a variety of source systems, including SAP HANA and Microsoft OLAP Cubes, s IT Solutions was confident that Tableau was the right tool for the job. With Tableau, The Erste Group has been able to: Tableau: Please provide us with your personal details and information about your company.\nRichard Reiling, Head of Group Datastore: My name is Richard Reiling. I am the head of Group Datastore and work at s IT Solutions. s IT Solutions is a service provider for Erste Group. Erste Group has about 40,000 employees and around 17 million customers. Tableau: What is the Tableau solution used for in your company?\nRichard:We are currently in the initial phase. We have conducted proof of concepts and will use Tableau mainly for prototyping and larger data-warehousing projects but also in the areas of data quality and project management. Tableau: What data sources do you use?\nRichard: The benefit of Tableau is clearly in the fact that it can be used on all kinds of source systems. We have also tested it on SAP HANA and Microsoft OLAP Cubes. SAS is still pending, but that's the benefit and our reason for using Tableau. Tableau: How satisfied are your users?\nRichard: The customers are very satisfied. The analysts really enjoy working with the tool. It is very visual and easy to use. I'll put it this way: I have known the market for about 15 years, and it's the Ferrari among BI tools. Tableau: What do users particularly like about Tableau?\nRichard: The speed, the easy operation and, above all, the visualizations and dashboard switching. Tableau: What benefit has the solution brought to your organization?\nRichard: The main reason for using Tableau was the fact that we had a large number of document analysts, i.e., business analysts, who mainly created documents. We also have a major data-warehousing project scheduled over the next five to six years, so we urgently needed to train the business analysts in data analysis. Above all, this meant one thing: understanding data. Tableau also makes a very good contribution here. Our hope is that we can also bring the business analysts to the next level in understanding data in the shortest period of time. Tableau: What is the outlook like for the future?\nRichard: In a way, we're building an onion. We are starting small at our Data Warehouse Department. Then, the whole system will be rolled out to the Group Center Functions, which is one departmental level higher. The next layer, of course, is the specialist unit. The layer after that serves to roll out the same thing in Romania, Croatia, Hungary, Czech Republic and so on, as presented by us at a group conference."

In this video, Head of Business Development, Michael Muirhead and Principal Information Development Manager, Jamie Gray discuss how Tableau has helped NHS Scotland: Tableau: What does Tableau enable you to do? Jamie Gray, Principal Information Development Manager: Tableau has offered a whole new medium by which we can engage our customers in NHS Scotland. Michael Muirhead, Head of Business Development: Tableau has allowed us to visualize data with a much more modern interface. It's making a lot more information a lot more accessible in an understandable way to a lot more of our customers, which has been really great A lot of the data that flows through the NHS comes to our organization. And we're responsible for the definition, the collection, the collation, and dissemination of all this information to support the NHS as it carries out its duties. And our Department of National Health Services provides a range of functions, for example, blood transfusion, the payment to doctors, GPs, dentists and pharmacists, national IT infrastructure and procurement, a whole range of things. The department that I'm involved in is around the information aspect of the NHS. And we're in a sense maybe the national information collection agency for the NHS in Scotland. Tableau: What kinds of projects are you using Tableau for? Michael: And as part of a program to modernize the way that we present our information back to our customers, we started to use Tableau. We're using it to develop a product called Discovery, which is really a product for our customers to use. But we're developing it very much with them. Jamie: It was a server-based solution that we needed because we didn't want to put the onus on the end user to have to procure any software or do anything different. So that kind of browser-based offering through the server was a nice option for us. Tableau: How does that work? Jamie: They can now actually get their hands on their own data that we've prepared for them. But the way they can cut, dice, and splice that and make it meaningful to them\u2014I think it's re-enlivened the whole relationship between us as an information provider and them as the end user. So it's been really encouraging. Michael: And our mission statement is turning information into evidence for action to support the health and well-being of the people of Scotland. And in that journey from data to information to translational intelligence is really important for us and we see Tableau as being really a crucial component of the armory that we have to allow us to achieve that. Tableau: How has Tableau changed your relationship to data? Michael: I think with the advent of Tableau our relationship with IT is a much more constructive, positive relationship. We've got much more cooperative, collaborative working partnership. We can do a lot more on our side of the fence, maybe from the business side. So in a sense we found using Tableau allows both sides of the organization to play to their strengths a lot more and it's much more efficient and effective way I think to do business. And our analysts who are working on Tableau have really embraced it actually. And once you go over the initial, 'this is different from how we normally do things,' they really embraced it, which is great to see. Tableau: How do you keep data secure? Jamie: An individual makes a request to a particular service that our organization provides, one of those being the Discovery service. And then in that they also request what level of access that they require. And then they have to give a reason for the local authorizer to approve it or reject it. So it's dynamically changing as the business thinks, 'okay, we've procured it for this,' but now we're thinking about how else we could use Tableau moving forward, and as a significant part of our toolset in the organization."

Senior Manager, BI and Analytics Team: We want to enable the business to move at the speed it needs to move to be competitive in the market. But at the same time, we also want to make sure our data is secure. So how do you balance that? Well, you balance it by having a seat at the table and starting the conversation of how do we do one metric, and then work from there. Tableau: What type of collaboration does this involve?\nWendy: To have something successful, it really starts by having three teams together at the table. And that's the business, that's BI and analytics, and that's IT, working together. Not 'This is mine, this is yours, and this is ours,' but saying, 'We have this business problem we need to solve. What are the best tools that we have in our space, and how do we go about creating something rapid, accurate, and sustainable?' Tableau: And how does Tableau help?\nWendy: I think with Tableau what that does is it enables people to learn about their data. More importantly, it tells them how their business processes are doing, how their initiatives are performing, and whether or not they're reaching their goals. So from that standpoint it allows the business owners, it allows management, it allows the line managers, all the way down to the individual contributor to see how am I doing, and how am I helping the business succeed from that standpoint. We use Tableau; we brought in Tableau because we needed a way to explore our data. And there was nothing else on the market that could do what Tableau does today."

They provide Web Analytics Implementation Tag Management Systems, Reporting & Analysis, and Testing & Optimization services for international brands such as Hallmark, 7-UP, and Intuit. In video 1, Ryan Sleeper, Director of Data Visualization & Analysis discusses how Evolytics uses Tableau to add interactivity and value to the reports that he creates for clients. In video 2, Ryan talks about his personal blog, OSMguy.com. He originally started the site to talk about sports and try out Tableau Public, but realized that his blogging skills could also apply to his working life. Tableau: How do you make data visualization useful for your clients?\nRyan Sleeper, Director of Data Visualization & Analysis: On the marketing agency side, is data visualization an important aspect of reporting to our clients? You know, we're a third party. We're trying to partner with different companies to provide them good analysis and end up with actual recommendations. Tableau: Do you ever get any feedback on these reports?\nRyan: Data visualization has always been a part of it, but there's kind of this culture on the marketing agency side where people are developing their reports, usually it's in Excel. They're pretty manual to create. They're not very actionable all the time, and you get that sense that you're sending out these weekly reports, monthly reports, and you wonder, \u201cIs anybody actually looking at this?\u201d Tableau: Did that change when you began using Tableau?\nRyan: When I was introduced to Tableau, I knew there'd be exciting opportunities to make them more interactive, help tell stories with data. Clients would be more apt to stick with them if they saw it and interacted with it. It's just a lot more exciting and it's definitely helped progress data visualization and the adoption of its value. In the beginning of my career, data visualization was based on static charts. And Tableau helped me by providing opportunities to make them interactive and more valuable for our clients. I would say absolutely. There's just so much more data that you can pack into the same amount of space if you can provide that interactivity like filters or tool tips and different types of interactions. It just provides so much more detail for the clients. Tableau: What specific needs led you to Tableau?\nRyan: I run a blog on the side. It's a personal blog called OSMGuy.com. And it really was invented out of a passion for sports and sports data. I just started to kind of try to answer some of my own questions by using Tableau Public. It's an amazing free tool that almost has all the same capabilities as Tableau Desktop. Tableau: Was there any overlap between the skills you developed while writing the blog and your professional life?\nRyan: Sports is a great data source to use with Tableau Public because the data is open and you're not hurting anybody's feelings by sharing that data. It truly became my sandbox for developing my skills in Tableau. I might make something a little more fancy or try to apply a little more innovative approach in my own personal blog that might not be as well received on the corporate side. But what I found is as I was able to use my own personal blog and Tableau Public as my sandbox for developing those skills, it almost always now kind of trickles down to the corporate side. So I get to kind of try and fail and try and fail in Tableau Public. And once I catch onto something that works, I can apply it in my day job. Tableau: Have you enjoyed being part of Tableau?\nRyan: I like to look at the data on how many shares it gets and that speaks volumes to me on whether or not something was successful, look at the traffic, where it's coming from. And, definitely, I've had people reach out from all over the world. The Tableau community is amazing. I'm just as accessible and happy to help as anyone and it's been really neat to establish some of those relationships beginning with the blog, taking it offline, and then eventually meeting them at the conference and things like that in person. It's been awesome. "

        "title": "Gutefrage.net answers questions in minutes instead of weeks",
        "company": "Gutefrage.net",
        "content": "Gutefrage.net is an advice website, supported by user-generated content. It is one of the widest-reaching websites in Germany, with up to 100 million visits per month. The company uses Tableau to monitor key performance indicators in specialist units and to make sound decisions based on confirmed data. Tableau enables employees to work quickly and independently, giving them more time to work on other projects. With Tableau, gutefrage.net found that reports are often available within minutes instead of weeks\u2014increasing productivity and reducing the time it takes to complete daily tasks. Tableau: What does gutefrage.net do? Dr. Franz Graf, Senior Data Scientist: gutefrage.net is Germany's biggest advice portal. It is a platform where users can ask questions about everyday life and receive useful answers within a short period of time. Tableau: How are you using Tableau at gutefrage.net? Dr. Graf: Tableau is used nearly every day. It offers quick, usage-relevant access to key data and independent access to data. Above all, the IT bottleneck has been dramatically mitigated, meaning that product owners or individual departments can work in a much more independent manner. Tableau: What do you like about Tableau in particular? Dr. Graf: The biggest benefit from the perspective of the users is certainly the fact that they no longer rely on IT for all tasks. They can work independently and access data quickly. In particular, they can quickly analyze data in an explorative manner and make quick, data-driven decisions. gutefrage.net benefits from Tableau as a BI analysis tool, because we have significantly reduced the round-trip times for answering analysis questions, partly from a matter of weeks in typical ticketing to a matter of minutes or hours. In the area of sales, we\u2019ve also made savings. A half-hour investment in Tableau workbook creation can result in savings that are in the man-day double-digit range. And savings are also easily made due to the fact that sales people can directly access data quickly and easily, where they would otherwise need to keep writing tickets to IT. Tableau: What was the situation like before you opted for Tableau? Dr. Graf: Before Tableau was rolled out, we didn't have a dedicated BI. Basically, we had no dedicated BI system. Consequently, analysis questions were passed on to IT, whether it was to the product owner or via tickets. Of course, this resulted in long round-trip times and long response times. Because the users were also used to having such long response times, they didn\u2019t even ask many relevant questions. This has changed thanks to Tableau. We went through a larger evaluation process at the end of last year, during which we evaluated several candidates. Ultimately, the great user-friendliness, intuitive use, and quick operation, but also the price and license model, were great plus points for Tableau. Tableau: Are there any other key aspects that should be mentioned? Dr. Graf: One thing I really like about Tableau is the fact that it gives me the option to involve my colleagues in the analysis process. That means our colleagues can work independently, which gives me more time to invest in other projects. Tableau: What is the Tableau solution used for in your company? Dr. Graf: The users covered via Tableau are, above all, data scientists and product owners, but department heads also use Tableau to make data-driven decisions. We currently have about ten Desktop users working with Tableau. Added to that are about 15 Tableau Server licenses, which are mainly used by department heads. Tableau is mainly used in several areas. On the one hand, we use it for data science and data analysis to establish interrelations between data and run visual analyses. On the other hand, we also use Tableau in pure dashboarding, or in other words, when tracking KPIs, which are important to the company to get quick access to relevant data. Another example of an area where we use Tableau is for product owners who want and have to test quickly\u2014whether they are developing the features for the correct KPIs or tracking the right KPIs to test whether the features work correctly and have the right impact. Of course, we also use it across the company in the areas of controlling, marketing, and sales to quickly access data and make these jobs easier. Tableau: What data sources do you use? Dr. Graf: At gutefrage, we currently use several data sources for Tableau. The MySQL database, where the master data is stored, is the main source used, but we also use Google Analytics as the tracking source and the source of events. The Google Analytics Connector of Tableau was an essential part of the evaluation for us because Google Analytics is a very common, deeply rooted tool. This also means that it was very important for Tableau to integrate well into the Google Analytics environment. Also important for us, of course, is the connection to AdSense so that we can check sales at all times. Another matter that is becoming increasingly important for us is event tracking, which comes directly from the website. This means that the events are saved in Hadoop and also back via the feedback loop to the Hadoop or Tableau users. This means that for all analyses run, MySQL is accessed directly, and the data is interpreted with Tableau. In terms of product owners, they definitely also use it at least several times per week and even daily, as the events and KPIs need to be permanently tracked in this case too. In terms of CEOs and CTOs, we\u2019re certainly in the range of weekly usage: Company KPIs are also permanently tracked. Moreover, pure Tableau Server users, in other words, the individual departments, use it several times per week. Tableau: What is the outlook like for the future? Dr. Graf: We certainly plan to expand the use of Tableau in the future. On the one hand, we plan to connect more users to Tableau, which will allow even more users to make data-driven decisions, etc. And on the other hand, we are planning to integrate Tableau into the data warehouse and the entire Hadoop environment in order to quickly and efficiently analyze this data set, too."

The company holds billions of indexed, digital records and has standing relationships with historical societies and government archives. Before Tableau, Ancestry.com was looking to establish a data-driven culture to improve communication and understanding. Bill Yetman, VP Commerce, Data & Analytics wanted to find a powerful tool that his team would be excited to use. With Tableau, Ancestry.com has been able to: Tableau: What made you look for a tool like Tableau? Bill Yetman, VP Commerce, Data & Analytics: You know, the quicker we can get to an insight, the quicker we can communicate, and we can tell the story with our data\u2014 the better off we are. As an executive in the organization, I want everybody to have their hands on everything. We were looking for different tools to work with to make the company more self-serve and be much more data-driven. Tableau: What made Tableau stand out from other Business Intelligence tools? Bill: I was looking for something that the organization could get excited about and get them reaching towards. It's easier to bring something in if somebody reaches for and pulls it towards them than if I am as a management team, pushing it at you. Tableau\u2014people responded to, reached out, pulled it in, and embraced it. And that\u2019s been the real surprise. Tableau: Can you describe that decision-making process? Bill: We did a Tableau demo, a two-week demo where we had 30 people go in, and they created about 130 reports. The hard problem was once we gave it to them and said, okay, this is just a free trial, they kept coming back and saying, \"how do I keep this turned on,\" right? So you've got a very addictive tool that gets into the people, and they just want to keep using it. Tableau: What kind of data do you visualize in Tableau? Bill: It\u2019s helped us a lot to communicate what's actually happening, and that's where Tableau has been huge. What are our users doing on a site, how often do they subscribe, how long do they stay with us, how often do they engage? And by that I would mean, how they search, do they accept a hint, are they building trees, what they are doing, how often do they come back. And that's what we're showing with Tableau. Tableau: Have there been other departments that have embraced the tool? Bill: The other team that was interesting to see change was our financial planning and analytics guys. They lived and died in their Excel spreadsheets. And when we got them to use Tableau, they converted over really quick and didn't want to let it go. It was amazing. With the previous tools we had, we had people that would look at them but not use them, and they'd go back to their Excel spreadsheets. They jumped into Tableau, and they stayed in Tableau. Tableau: How do you connect to your data in Tableau? Bill: Our main data warehouse is Matrix. It used to be Power Cell. So it's an MPP system, and really, really fast. We\u2019ve got some tables in there that have billions of rows. We have one that's 220 billion. And when we're hitting it with Tableau with those queries, it comes back quick, and it allows us to do some really cool visualizations with that data. That\u2019s the key. Just having access and pulling it up is one thing, but being able to take a look at it and see what the trends are, get an understanding so that we can make a strategic decision for the company\u2014that's a key."

When it comes to compiling \u2018trunks\u2019 on a daily basis, data is key to keeping stylists on track and clients happy. In video 1, Brian O\u2019Connor, Senior Director of Business Intelligence speaks about how Tableau has transformed the culture of operations, illuminating the data and driving friendly competition between teams. In video 2, Meagan Colbenson, Senior Manager of Business Intelligence talks about how Tableau is \u201ctailored for data lovers,\u201d quickly putting data in the hands of the users who need it most. In video 3, Brian talks about how Trunk Club balances data governance with self-service analytics. Tableau: How does Tableau fit in at Trunk Club? Brian O\u2019Connor, Senior Director of Business Intelligence: Our philosophy is we help men look great, and Tableau is the perfect partnership in helping us make our data look great. We're e-commerce, but with a personal touch. Tableau: How long did it take to roll out Tableau across the organization? Brian: We rolled out Tableau in roughly like three months, so Server and 30 licenses of Desktop, and it's been great. It's been absolutely wonderful. We learned from our mistakes and what we wanted to do better\u2014and we had a second opportunity to do it. So, it's been a lot of fun. Tableau: What kind of data are you visualizing in Tableau? Brian: One of the things that's great is that we collect a lot of information, around what guys like, what they've seen, what they don't like, what fits and what doesn't fit. We collect all that data. Tableau: How has Tableau made an impact at Trunk Club? Brian: We\u2019ve made an impact in a lot of areas. I think the two areas that have really, really had the most impact are the operations\u2014the warehouse. So before they were tracking what they did pretty much on spreadsheets, things like that, and it was a lot of work to really figure out what they had done. And we've now illuminated all that data. We have dashboards in the warehouse that tell people how each team's doing. So it's created this competitive nature of, \u201chey, we're going to do better.\u201d And so literally people are coming back from their lunches early and packing boxes faster. So it's kind of this fun game part of that. Tableau: Has Tableau impacted any other areas of the business? Brian: On the sales side, which is really, really crucial to our business\u2014you know, how we interact with our customers and how we service them. We\u2019ve been able to show the sales directors who have a team of stylists underneath them how everyone's doing, how their team's doing in comparison to other people, and maybe the things that they need to focus on. Having that data in front of them\u2014refreshed whenever they want, instead of having to go pull it and think about it\u2014has really been able to have them turn back towards the customer. You know, interaction and customer satisfaction is the primary piece that they do every day. Tableau: Can you share a specific moment where you saw the value of Tableau? Brian: One of the exciting parts of my job is being able to see an Excel jockey who's very, very sophisticated in all things to do with Excel and those are great. But then turning them onto Tableau and watching like their life change and all of a sudden they're in early at work and late there at night because they're excited to work with the product and excited to uncover things. It's fun when you give someone a Tableau license and then a month later they stop you in the hall, and they open up their laptop, and they're like, \u201cyou have to see what I just created, you have to see it.\u201d There\u2019s nothing else out there like it. You know, I've looked at pretty much everything, and there's no competition. Tableau: Who is doing most of the reporting at Trunk Club? Meagan Colbenson, Senior Manager of Business Intelligence: I'm pretty much doing most of the data publications. We've got a really small development team, so we're pretty scrappy. I work directly with a lot of the end users and making sure I understand what they need and we code it up in SQL and create data publications. Tableau: What do you like most about using Tableau? Meagan: To have a tool that's so tailored for data lovers is unbelievable. I mean, it's nice because it doesn't force you to rip apart everything that you have. It just kind of complements things you have, whether you have a big, bloated SAP implementation or something else. Like, it just kind of works nicely in whatever environment you have. And so for me, it's nice to be able to very quickly get our data in the hands of the end users, and they're super excited. It's so rewarding. I mean, having that quick turnaround makes you feel so good about your job. Tableau: What was the situation like before Tableau? Meagan: Working on big data warehouse projects, which I've done, like, year-long implementations is just tedious and it takes a long time to see the reward. And by the time you get there, it's like the questions are so irrelevant now. And everybody's frustrated and they've all done their own thing. Tableau: In your opinion, what is a benefit of using Tableau? Meagan: It's nice to be able to try to keep up with the pace of business questions and new tech features and things like that in Tableau. I'm an Excel jockey, self-professed. And I'm like the hotkey queen, which everybody on my team kind of makes fun of me for. But that said, I could not figure out graphs in Excel to save my life because it's so not intuitive, right? Like, you have to know which graph makes sense based on your data, you have to play around with it forever to try to figure out what makes sense. And Tableau just takes all that complexity away. Tableau: How is Tableau different than Excel? Meagan: It adds additional visualizations that you wouldn't have even thought of or Excel might not even have available. And, you know, they're trying to catch up now. But I think for me that was the hugest\u2014when I first started with Tableau, that was the big selling point was, like, wow, it just looks at the data I have, and it says, \"You should do these things.\" And that was awesome. Tableau: Do you have an example of a time where Tableau saved you time? Meagan: I think the big thing for me is when a user says, \"I want to be able to report on this thing. It's not in the source data at all, but I have an attribute that I'm tracking in Excel. I only update it monthly, it's not a big deal.\" We don't even have to bug the source team right now. I can pull it in, blend it together even in SQL or we could do it in the data publication and kick it out. And that could be done in a matter of days versus a matter of weeks\u2014a month that it would take to take it through the full implementation and bug the source team, do ETL, all that jazz. I mean, that's been the huge, huge increase in productivity on our side because it might not even be that important, they just don't know, right? So we have to get it in there, get it in their hands, they can prototype, and we decide if it's worth putting it into production and taking it to the next level. Tableau: How has your team reacted to Tableau? Meagan: You can save weeks, really. And then you can kick out another one, and another one and you serve more people and everybody's happy. They love Tableau. Tableau: Why do you use Tableau? Brian: I like Tableau because you know, it's a more agile process. It puts the power in front of the end user who really understands what they're looking for and what they want to say with the data. And we partner on it now. So it's not us and them\u2014it's more a partnership. Tableau: How have you instated self-service analytics at Trunk Club? Brian: We're not really under the IT umbrella. We\u2019re in between the business and IT. So, you know, if the business is blue, and IT is red, we're the purple people. And I think by us working directly with power users without a middleman has been crucial to our success. Hearing it directly from them, turning around an extract with a couple of changes in it, immediately getting feedback and getting the UAT right, you know, literally immediately. And then be able to make those into a product, has shrunk down our execution time tremendously. So I think that's one of the keys is positioning your team to be the voice for both sides. I think is really key. Tableau: On the subject of self-service, how are you empowering your users? Brian: The other side of the coin with self-service BI, allows you to be able to knock down these walls, get insights into these things\u2014but you can also end up with a mess on your hands, right? And it can be a free-for-all and things like that. I think one of the things that we've found is that the best way to use this product, the best way to empower these users is to literally let them do whatever they need to do. However, have some type of governance before things get released to executives, before they get released up top. Have sandboxes, have playground environments that you can publish to, they can consume\u2014but only the best and brightest of those then move up and out. Tableau: What has been a benefit of using Tableau at Trunk Club? Brian: You know, obviously being able to publish things and having to fill out a form in triplicate and like getting it approved is not the style of BI anymore. There's some looseness to it but I think with looseness you get the greatness that you never would have gotten before, and I think that's the best part."

        "content": "Indiana University (IU), a leading research university and Santa Barbara Community College (SBCC), a beachside community college are radically strengthening their educational programs and student resources with data. With Tableau, university staff can drill down into data sets to understand the factors that impact student success\u2014including enrollment, course offerings, and classroom sizes. Today with Tableau, both universities can now take corrective action quickly, opening up new courses or intervening when a student is struggling. Indiana University (IU) enrolls more than 100,000 students, operating two core campuses, several satellite campuses and online programs, and offering more than 500 academic programs. The student body is highly diverse, coming from different parts of the world, at different times in their life, with different academic and professional goals. Bridgett Milner, Senior Associate Director of Strategic Planning and Research in the Office of Enrollment Management researches undergraduate student recruitment, enrollment, and retention to drive projects related to student achievement. Among all of their responsibilities, the office uses Tableau to identify trends and gaps within course offerings that could potentially impact student success. \u201cMy job is monitoring and ultimately proposing courses of action to help IU become an even more amazing place,\u201d shares Bridgett. When the team adopted Tableau, they were surprised by how quickly they could start analyzing data. \u201c[What\u2019s impactful is] getting that data in Tableau and uncovering trends easily. Things that often took us hours now take us mere seconds.\u201d Bridgett\u2019s role requires creating reports and building predictive models, regularly sharing her findings with senior leadership and policy makers to drive strategy around admission and scholarship offerings. \u201cHaving a tool where we can easily break things apart when we're making decisions is powerful,\u201d says Bridgett. \u201cCollege is this great place,\u201d says Bridgett. \u201cMy job is ultimately proposing courses of action to help become a more amazing place. Ideally, we're recruiting and enrolling a great class that then graduates.\u201d Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) is one of the oldest colleges in California, enrolling between 17,000 to 20,000 students annually. Some attend school full-time during the day, while others attend school part-time at night. Despite the fact that each of these students are unique, all of them need to enroll in the right course at the right time to achieve their academic goals. SBCC\u2019s Institutional Research and Planning department is a small team responsible for understanding the scope of classes the student body needs to be successful. The team relies on data to make critical decisions about course offerings, classroom sizes, facility needs, and more. SBCC also uses Tableau dashboards to evaluate overall academic performance against peer institutions in California and nationwide. For example, SBCC staff use data to understand how students\u2019 course schedules impact grades and ultimately, graduation rates. \u201cRight away, we built things that were useful and revealing. And for a small department like ours, that's huge,\u201d said Robert Else, Senior Director of Institutional Research and Planning, Santa Barbara City College when asked about Tableau. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that having Tableau contributes to the success across campus,\u201d says Robert. In addition to understanding granular data, the team also uses Tableau to gain a 360-view of college operations, \u201cYou break down silos, and you're seeing the college as a whole, which any organization really ought to be doing. Tableau has helped the school to make better decisions that affect student success.\u201d For instance, Deans can now manage course enrollment at the department level with Tableau dashboards. They rely on data to determine when to open additional courses, update course descriptions, or cancel classes altogether to reallocate resources. That means, SBCC students, regardless if they attend school full-time or part-time, can trust the courses they need will be available to them. SBCC counselors also use Tableau to quickly identify the students that may need additional assistance outside of the classroom\u2014allowing them to actively reach out to students before they lag behind."

Tableau: What is the Tableau solution used for in your company?\nSven: Churn rate, retention and our number of MAUs or monthly active users. What are the most-watched offerings on our service? What channels are popular at certain times? What shows are popular, broken down by age group and gender? These are the initial KPIs we want to analyze to begin with. That\u2019s what we\u2019re building dashboards for. Going forward, we\u2019ll also carry out complete funnel analysis in the marketing team. In other words, what campaigns did the user arrive by? How many clicks did each campaign generate? And how many sign-ups? Which valuable users came from certain campaigns? So basically, which campaigns were ultimately the most effective? Tableau: What data sources do you use?\nSven: In Vertica, and ultimately in the data warehouse, we tap into various data sources. These include the Hadoop archive but also some data from Google Analytics and campaign tracking. We have a partner called Adjust, which provides us with the data, and we use an API or server callback to pull the data to our data warehouse. Generally, Tableau is connected to this data warehouse\u2014to Vertica. It contains everything about usage. In that regard, we\u2019ve already progressed a lot so that the management team analyzes daily Tableau exports or uses live dashboards to clarify management-related questions. Tableau: How satisfied are your users?\nSven: Recently I received an email from the head of HR. She saw Tableau and used it for the first time about a month ago and immediately sent me an email with \"Tableau Lover\" as the subject line. Everyone who sees Tableau at our company is immediately enthusiastic about it. Therefore, the satisfaction levels are relatively high, simply because the dashboards are so nice or because they can be built so nicely\u2014and also far more intuitively compared to the old Excel monsters we used to have. Tableau: What do you like about Tableau in particular? Sven: I am the main user of Tableau, and what I like in particular about Tableau is the ease of use and the speed of analyzing things. I used to have to pull the data out of Hadoop, import it to an Excel table, and analyze the data or generate some plots with Air scripts. It took ages, and when I made a mistake, I had to start over. This is a lot faster with Tableau\u2014an extremely important point. Another point is the variability and interactivity of visual illustration. I can click on things, change the KPI, set the dimensions and filters differently and thereby save a lot of time on my way to gaining insight. What I personally enjoy a lot about Tableau is simply playing around with it. I have a hypothesis and just go wild playing around with the data to see what happens. Ultimately, this creative process is a lot easier with Tableau. And I really appreciate that."

        "content": "Blogger and data journalist Ingo Levin from Berlin spends his free time analyzing and visualizing every single shot made in the German Basketball league BBL. His shot charts are embedded into his articles published across various blogs and internet platforms for the basketball community.His interactive and easy-to-use dashboards allow for detailed comparison of players, teams, shot positions, shot percentages and lots more. His weapon of choice is Tableau Public, a data visualization and publishing tool available free of cost for non-commercial users. Levin has come to appreciate Tableau Public especially for its excellent user support provided by support staff and the Tableau community alike. Tableau: Please introduce yourself briefly. Ingo Levin, Data Journalist and Blogger: Hi, I\u2019m Ingo Levin. I\u2019m a blogger, or what Tableau people call a data journalist. I work a lot with basketball data. I am a passionate basketball fan and have set myself the task of visualizing lots of data related to the sport with the orange ball. I write for a variety of blogs, but my own blog is korbrechnung.de. This is a mix of hoops and calculations, and calculation matters can be visualized. We also have another small project, giveandgobasketball.de, where we make a video show and podcasts about the sport in general. I regularly contribute to courtreview.de, the biggest German language basketball community, where I also embed Tableau statistics or Tableau visualizations on a regular basis. Tableau is my tool of choice.. Tableau: What exactly are you doing with Tableau solutions? Ingo: This currently involves, since the beginning of this German Basketball League season, the recording of all players' shots during a game. This includes recording what position they were thrown from and whether they went in, which player made the shot and at what time. I prepare the data, aggregate it and create entire charts for players and teams so that all of their shots can be seen over the course of the season. It is possible to see that one player shoots particularly well from the left corner, for instance. Player A gets to the basket very frequently. He makes 60 percent of his shots close to the basket but scores only 20 percent of the time. I provide these analyses in my blog so that people can really say precisely for every player and every team what their preferences are and where they may not play so well. To do this, I use Tableau Public. It\u2019s great for me because it gives me a great number of options with which to visualize things. Also, what is good here is that for someone like me\u2014or for a journalist\u2014it\u2019s publicly available without me having to pay thousands of Euros in licensing fees. Tableau: What sort of feedback do you receive with regards to your Tableau visualizations? Ingo: The feedback from the community is consistently positive. It must be said that analyzing and leveraging data in basketball in Germany is still not very common. People now have a tool that lets them explore the background in a way they might not have known before, so the feedback is extremely positive. Tableau: Are the actual teams making use of your Tableau-analyses? Ingo: I know from some people and team officials that they have actually used them. I couldn\u2019t say whether they are used during daily training or in game preparation. However, I know that they know about it. I know that people are very open and positive about this and that it could certainly give you a slight advantage over other teams in preparation. Naturally I hope that they will be used even more in the future. Tableau: Which visualization features of Tableau are the most important or useful to you? Ingo: For me, the best things I\u2019ve made with it are these shot charts. These are scatter plots where I\u2019ve projected the basketball pitch as the background image. Tableau: How would you describe your experience with using tableau? Easy or difficult? Ingo: The learning process never ends. This is also because there is a very big community. There are also websites for Tableau Public where all the visualizations and work folders of other users can be viewed publicly. This always provides new inspirations. Tableau: Which aspects of the Tableau environment are especially important to you? Ingo: For me, one of the key aspects in the entire Tableau portfolio is the fact that Tableau Public is freely available for private individuals. This isn\u2019t just about saving costs. It also offers a very simple entry point into the entire world of data visualization. There are so many people writing interesting articles, but in the end it\u2019s only text. This text would be so much more valuable if it was backed up with an informative chart. I sometimes get the impression that a lot of people would like to do this but simply don\u2019t have the tools available. Moreover, a lot of people can\u2019t program, create JavaScript files, charts, etc. So, it\u2019s ideal that such a product exists. It fills a real market gap so that normal people with a certain level of data and technology knowledge can use it to provide a more interesting context. For me, that's really a super thing about Tableau. The company really focuses on data journalists as its target group. It wants to support them and offers them invitations and is always available when questions arise. Tableau: What are your plans for using Tableau in the future? Ingo: I certainly have some future plans for Tableau. So far, I\u2019m really just scratching the surface. As someone who is often dealing with business-intelligence technology in a professional context, I certainly have a lot of experience. I recognize where there is still potential, including for the things I\u2019m currently doing privately with basketball shot-statistics analysis. I also have various new visualizations in the pipeline. I\u2019m currently testing how I can best implement them using Tableau. So far, I can say that everything I want to do can be done with Tableau. For the start of the next season, I will certainly be able to provide new charts and new visualizations for the community. Hopefully they\u2019ll be received as well as the last ones were."

        "content": "The University of Western Sydney (UWS) is a research-led university with six campuses spanning across Greater Western Sydney. UWS is top-ranked institution, serving over 40,000 students in the region. Higher education regulations in Australia are changing. To remain competitive, UWS uses Tableau to monitor the education market in Sydney. With Tableau, UWS has been able to: Tableau: Has higher education in Australia changed over the course of the years? Neil Durrant, Associate Director, Business Intelligence and Institutional Research: We're in a really interesting situation at the moment in Australian higher education because it's gradually being deregulated. It used to be that the universities kind of had a cap on student numbers. And so every university would just kind of fill their quota, and that would be it. There's competition for different kinds of students, but really, in terms of numbers, sheer numbers, everyone just went to their quota and that was it. Tableau: And how does that compare to now? Neil: That was removed in 2012. So there's a bit more competition between us. You could have as many students as you could manage. So the universities started competing harder for students. And right now, there's a bill before our parliament to sort of deregulate higher education further and allow universities to set their own price. So there will be even further competition. Tableau: How have those changes impacted UWS? Neil: There's a whole bunch of things that we have to know now that we didn't need to know before. One of the things that we have done is we've looked at geographic kind of analysis of the market in Sydney. It really helped people to plan what they're going to offer where. So some of those market dynamics have been really interesting. Tableau: How has UWS used Tableau to prepare for these changes? Neil: The other interesting thing that we've done with Tableau, which is not really a visualization thing, but we've had to go through a process of thinking about what prices we might set when the deregulation happens. And we've had some models built in Excel that produce some outputs in terms of the competition for students if we went to this price, what we might lose, what we might gain, et cetera. Tableau: What does that look like in Tableau? Neil: I wanted to make that stuff easily available and accessible. So I built the model in Tableau, the pricing model, which has got a lot of calculations and it's got a lot of numbers, but it gives people that interactivity. A school dean, for example, could just check out his school and see if he set a particular price, what the consequences might be for revenue, for cost, for profitability, for student intake. Tableau: What other UWS groups are using Tableau? Neil: There's a committee responsible for the student experience. Typically, we have this commencing student survey that we run every year that goes out to 8,000 students. And it used to be that we'd have an analysis of the commencing student sentiment by sort of three-quarters of the way through the year, which is a bit too late really to do anything for them. What used to happen is the chair of the student experience committee would sort of print out a couple hundred pages of survey comments and take them home and read them over the weekend and, in their mind, try to figure out what the themes were or what things we could have tried to address for our commencing students. Tableau: And how are you tracking that in Tableau? Neil: One of the things we did do was try to visualize survey responses using Tableau. And we've also got IBM just text analytics underneath, which sort of reads all the free text comments and classifies them into groups. So we came up with a design to visualize that. Tableau: What benefits have you seen? Neil: You can imagine, by the time all that's done, they're not commencing students anymore. So what we've done is we've turned that around to the sixth or seventh week of the first semester. We have some results available and all those survey comments visualized. And so people can see at a glance for a particular course what the best aspects are, what the worst aspects are, what needs improvement, what students are sort of dealing with at that particular time in the first four weeks of their experience. The committee has got access now that they just never had before. It enables us to formulate responses and try to address students' concerns much faster. Tableau: How much time have you saved? Neil: If you multiply that out\u201470 or 80 people spending a couple of days spread out over maybe a couple of weeks. Then trying to just get the baseline sorted for them to think about how to write a report on the course performance. We now have a process where we have one analyst who spends a few weeks putting the back-end data together. Using Alteryx too\u2014it's really a couple of hours for one person to get all of that published into a dashboard that is accessible. Tableau: How do employees interact with that dashboard? Neil: If they set a different price, it'll change and show them the consequences of that price. So if we come up with a new pricing scheme, we can very easily update all of that and have that available. So that's been a brand new thing that we've done, which I think is pretty cool and really relevant to the university as it sort of tries to navigate these new environments. Tableau: Has Tableau set you up for future changes? Neil: With the changes to the higher-education environment, we are going to have to take a more businesslike approach. So I see Tableau as well as our other parts of the BI platform, as providing that businesslike information for managing the university Tableau: What are your plans for the future? Neil: The next big thing for us is trying to provide the school, faculty executive management, with that single point of access for the data that they need to manage their part of the organization effectively."

        "content": "Aeria Games develops its own computer games, adjusts existing games to the needs of regional users and operates its own server platforms for the game on the Internet. The company currently has about 70 Tableau users in order to obtain new findings about its online gaming customers and their preferences. When Aeria Games was taken over by ProSiebenSat.1 GmbH in February 2014, the company benefited, in particular, from Tableau's ability to standardize the most varied data records and sources and make them available to its users in a convenient manner for any evaluation or analysis. Tableau: Please tell us a little bit about what you do at Aeria Games. Stefanie Neubeck, Business Intelligence Analyst: My name is Stefanie Neubeck. I have worked at Aeria Games for about a year. I'm employed there as a business-intelligence analyst for data analysis and statistical evaluation. Aeria Games is a so-called online game publisher, which means we take finished games from the Asian market, for instance, and localize them for the European market. In other words, we take care of the marketing and adapt game content. Tableau: How are you using Tableau in your company? Stefanie: We use Tableau, above all, for matters in our department, which is Business Intelligence. There are five of us. We take care of processing reports, preparing them and forwarding them to various departments. Currently, about 70 people work very actively with Tableau every day, and I think about 100 to 120 people rely on the data that is released and forwarded as email reports, for instance. What we hope to achieve from this use of the data is far greater insight and, above all, quick insight to make quick analyses. We use Tableau, on one hand, to forward very general reports to all employees. On the other hand, we also try to enable special departments, such as our Production or Marketing departments, to do this, or give them the opportunity to explore the data themselves, run their own analyses and, for instance, try out in-game data and analyze various things. They can also see the data visually in graphics, possibly make various assumptions about this, and get back to us so that we can check those assumptions jointly. Tableau: What data sources do you use? Stefanie: Above all, we use Amazon Redshift as a data source. This is the main location where our data warehouse is based. There are some projects where we link to the games and into the database directly. This can, for instance, involve MySQL or various databases. Tableau can be used in very different, individual ways. We have not yet arrived at a point where we haven\u2019t been able to get on top of a database using Tableau. That's why we're so flexible. Tableau: How satisfied are your users? Stefanie: The first users at our company, the Business Intelligence team, are enthusiastic about Tableau. We can see how easy it is to use Tableau. We enjoy our work. When we pass on our reports, I will mention the end users in the company, whose initial responses are mostly about how nice Tableau is to look at and how easy it is to use the filters. We still need to convince some people to work less with Excel and more with us and with Tableau. We're just getting involved in the process, but generally the feedback we're getting is very positive. This is thanks to the simplicity and beauty that Tableau offers. Tableau: What do users like about Tableau in particular? Stefanie: The nice thing about Tableau for our users is the fact that they can access it very easily. They can access the data from anywhere using their tablets or computers. They don\u2019t need to know much about it nor do they need to spend a long time familiarizing themselves with Tableau, because it\u2019s very intuitive. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t need much time for training sessions, etc. Tableau: What benefit has the solution brought to your organization? Stefanie: We have been using Tableau at Aeria Games for about 18 months. Also, we were acquired by Prosieben about a year ago. There was a major project to standardize all data. Tableau was a great help here, because we managed to standardize all data sources and everything else in Tableau. In other words, end users only have to use a single tool to obtain all of the data. Consequently, it was one of our greatest successes to create standardized data and convince users to search for data using one tool. What\u2019s more, to save time, we are no longer at a point where we need to compare data. We have a tool that we trust. It\u2019s quicker to get to know this tool. I would say that providing fewer training sessions and getting people to work with Tableau quickly is a huge savings in time for us. It has really saved us a lot of time. Tableau: What is the outlook like for the future? Stefanie: We are currently at a point where we have expanded our standard reporting. We have encouraged all our employees who rely on the data to work with the data and look into it independently. What we plan to do in the near future is to enable end users to understand the data structure, run statistical analyses there independently, make independent forecasts and independently discover trends to an even greater extent. This would take the workload off our Business Intelligence team a little so they can have more of a support role in order to assist other companies or other departments. This is only just starting now and will be a process lasting several weeks. However, this is what we are aiming for: more end users being able to run their analyses independently. Tableau: From your perspective, are there any other key aspects for which you'd recommend Tableau? Stefanie: Particularly important for me about Tableau is the following: I have only been using Tableau for one year. I was given little training. I was thrown in at the deep end. But I still enjoy it. I still familiarized myself with it quickly. One of the greatest gifts for me is that I go to work and enjoy myself. I believe that I\u2019ve got a good thing going when I can enjoy going out and telling people about Tableau, even in my personal life."

I manage Business Intelligence at Stylight. Stylight is a platform that combines content with e-commerce. Every day our editorial team picks the latest and best in beauty, lifestyle and fashion, and aggregates it to inspire our customers. Customers can then shop for fashion directly on our website. Tableau: What is the Tableau solution used for in your company?\nDr. Wemh\u00f6ner: We use Tableau in the Business Intelligence Department, where we prepare reports for the various departments and provide assistance in decision making. We currently have four active users in Business Intelligence who prepare reports, but various departments receive the reports via Tableau Reader and Tableau Cloud. Ultimately, it involves more than 50 people. Tableau: What data sources do you use?\nDr. Wemh\u00f6ner: As an e-commerce business, we have many online data sources, of course. We use Tableau to integrate and combine various data sources to create information that wasn\u2019t previously available in that form. We support management using key financial indicators and our Marketing Department with performance data in terms of users. Also, in fashion-tagging for products\u2014specifically how we tag\u2014reports on how well certain products are tagged, etc. Our main data source is currently Amazon Redshift, which we use as a data warehouse. Furthermore, we integrate Google Analytics and data from online platforms like BuzzStream or Google AdWords via various custom-written ETL scripts. Tableau: How satisfied are your users?\nDr. Wemh\u00f6ner: Users are very satisfied. Tableau allows end users to further focus on specific data in the reports we prepare at Business Intelligence and go into greater detail. The rollout was very simple, and the product is very intuitive for our users. Tableau: What do you like about Tableau in particular?\nDr. Wemh\u00f6ner: It's the fact that users can access the data themselves instead of receiving static reports in PDF or Excel files. They're not just confronted with data but can search for new information in an interactive manner. The departments have, of course, a far deeper understanding of their work, and we support them with the initial preparation. The decision-making process, however, takes place in the department. Tableau: What benefit has the solution brought to your organization?\nDr. Wemh\u00f6ner: In the first year of using Tableau, we managed to reduce the manual work previously required when aggregating data from various sources in Excel or Google by more than a hundred hours. This means the departments can save more than a hundred man hours. They can use this time to actually do the work they want to do and not just update Excel sheets. In terms of information we can generate far deeper insight by aggregating data sources that we previously couldn't connect with in this way. In particular the integration of Google Analytics with our in-house data is a great help. Tableau: What was the situation like before you opted for Tableau?\nDr. Wemh\u00f6ner: I've been with Stylight for one year, and Business Intelligence at Stylight was sort of established at the same time I started. Before then, a lot of reports were kept in Excel and Google spreadsheets. Updating those spreadsheets involved a lot of manual tasks. Our challenge was to find a tool that would support us in making these manual tasks easier, and which also provided the option of communicating easily between the different offices we have in London and New York. And that was when we came across Tableau. Tableau: Why did you opt for Tableau?\nDr. Wemh\u00f6ner: When I started working here, we took a two-month period to collect information about solutions that would help us visualize our data and distribute it between continents. We tested Tableau over a period of two weeks, and it was really helpful that the entire setup and management of the server system was handled by Tableau. This enabled our team of back then only two people to provide a company with two hundred people with the reports they needed. Tableau: Are there any key aspects that should be mentioned?\nDr. Wemh\u00f6ner: Over the course of our work with Tableau, we've noted that there is a very active community. Many of our questions were answered by the community within a couple of days, if not hours, or they had already been answered online. This is very helpful for us, and we have the impression that Tableau is being used by more and more companies. The exchange between various companies and sectors shows us use cases that we've not seen previously, and helps us continue our development as BI."

Kreditech uses the Tableau solution mainly for management reporting but also for product optimization in individual areas of marketing and in finance. Due to the good results, quicker analyses and lower acquisition costs, Kreditech plans to expand the solution to other applications in the near future. Tableau: Please provide us with your personal details and information about your company. Sebastian Ranzinger, Head of Business Intelligence: My name is Sebastian Ranzinger. I work for Kreditech. This is a company in the financial technology sector. Tableau: What is the Tableau solution used for in your company? Sebastian: Generally, we try to provide Tableau to everyone. Our developers in the areas of business intelligence and data science are the main users at this moment. We also have individual users who come directly from internal customers, particularly from controlling or management. We use Tableau predominantly for management reporting but also in individual areas of marketing for product optimization and in the finance area. Tableau: What data sources do you use? Sebastian: We have a relatively complicated or complex setup with an open-source Postgres database, a MongoDB database and a non-relational database as well as various external data sources, along with manual input. In other words, nearly anything you can imagine. We use Tableau every day, including for real-time reporting. Tableau: How satisfied are your users? Sebastian: We looked at several BI solutions in advance, of course, and Tableau consistently got the best feedback. We regularly still get feedback today that\u2019s very positive. It's just very easy and intuitive to use. Tableau: What do you like about Tableau in particular? Sebastian: I would say that users most appreciate its intuitive use, as I just mentioned, and in particular the attractive presentation of the data and the speed at which we can analyze data that we couldn't previously achieve. Tableau:What benefit has the solution brought to your organization? Sebastian:We use Tableau intensively in marketing. We've managed to achieve very good results in that area. In channel optimization, we have core KPIs, such as the costs per acquisition, which are very important in online marketing in order to make significant savings, and also in central markets and key channels, simply from the fact that information that used to be invisible to users is now available. Tableau:What was the situation like before you opted for Tableau? Sebastian:Before we used Tableau, we didn\u2019t actually have a functioning data warehouse. Back then, we used Cognos, but only to a very limited extent as the implementation cycles were far longer than with Tableau and we hardly even achieved initial results. We then decided to go for greater speed with Tableau. Tableau:Why did you opt for Tableau? Sebastian:It goes without saying that we had a look at several alternatives and ultimately opted for Tableau. It wasn\u2019t a difficult decision, as the speed of the implementation on one hand and the speed of how users can obtain data and run analyses on the other hand is simply unmatched by any other tools. Tableau:What is the outlook like for the future? Sebastian:We are growing and are currently at 200 employees and growing rapidly. So, we naturally want to make Tableau available to everyone. Accordingly, an expansion is planned."

Using Tableau, Bridgei2i\u2019s client was able to: The strategy team of a global technology company approached Bridgei2i to help improve its market forecasting processes. Historically, the client organization relied on a global team to prepare the overall market forecast. This involved multiple, static reports primarily delivered in Excel spreadsheets and .CSV files. And since the insights were not region-specific, each regional team developed its own forecasts as well, using local reports. The lack of a unified view of data across the organization created confusion around the true numbers. Example of Bridgei2i's market forecasting visualization The client asked Bridge i2i to build a solution\u2014using 100MB of data\u2014 that would deliver a single version of truth for its market share/size forecasting. This information would be used by 900 executives working in roles such as strategy, sales planning, marketing strategy, product management from departments including Global Strategy, Marketing and regional country level Marketing. Because all of these executives would have different questions of the data, the solution would need to allow custom drill-downs at each level of the product/region/business unit. Bridgei2i has been successful in delivering business solutions in 12+ projects using Tableau. It has deep expertise as well as knowledge of visualization within the organization. The team chose Tableau for this project mainly due to the software\u2019s ease of use and ability to customize reports on a regional/product level as required by different business users. For this project, Bridgei2i suggested creating a master version of the market forecast report that would deliver intuitive, flexible insight into the data. Executives would be able to drill into the data, answering their specific questions and filtering views by parameters such as region or product line. A team of 30, including consultants from Bridgei2i, worked on the implementation. The implementation was carried out in two phases each spanning about 45 days. Bridgei2i accesses data from the client\u2019s Web Portal, from where it can be downloaded in an Excel format. The data sources include Google Analytics, MySQL, Flat files, MS Excel as well as MS Access. The reports are developed and maintained within the client firewall with VPN access and the authentication is completed using Active Directory. Bridge i2i analyzes roughly 100-500M rows of data that using Tableau. Once the analysis is complete, Bridgei2i uploads the final report on SharePoint in the form of a Tableau Packaged Workbook. Client executives can then access required information using the Tableau Reader. The solution is extremely user-friendly, and works on more than 50 devices and across platforms such as iOS and Android. Bridgei2i is now closely tracking utilization and working on fine-tuning content for its client. \u201cWe were able to use Tableau\u2019s visual analytics capabilities very well to deliver great market forecasting insights to our client,\u201d said Sandip Saha, Strategic Marketing Manager at Bridgei2i. The client earlier spent approximately $300,000 per year on various analyst reports specific to each region. With the implementation in place, the investment in the entire market forecasting process has been cut down drastically, to 1/10th of the original amount. And the time taken to produce the market forecasting reports has been cut down by ten days per quarter. Overall, Bridgei2i\u2019s solution using Tableau has been able to show a drastic improvement in the market share process for its client."

The AeroM\u00e9xico network spans over 80 cities across the globe; the airline owns over 120 aircrafts. Previously, AeroM\u00e9xico dealt with several data sources and formats. The bulk of analysis took place in flat Excel files\u2014limiting the insights that they could find in their data. Now with Tableau, teams create dynamic dashboards, allowing them to manage large amounts of data with \u201cpractically a single click.\u201d In this video, Subdirector of Information Security, Jes\u00fas Vega Lopez and Internal Audit Manager, Julio Magdaleno Maga\u00f1a discuss how Tableau allows AeroM\u00e9xico to: Tableau: How would you summarize your thoughts about Tableau? Jes\u00fas Vega Lopez, Subdirector of Information Security: This kind of tool is really vital. Having dashboards and the detail of the data in a practical, user-friendly format and in real time has definitely helped us. It's extraordinary! Tableau: How did you work with data before Tableau? Jes\u00fas: Previously, we administered that data using different database management systems, in different text formats, and different sources. Julio Magdaleno Maga\u00f1a, Internal Audit Manager: Before using Tableau, we handled all of our data, well, let's call it manually\u2014Excel spreadsheets, it took a lot of time. We were limited when it came to handling our data. Tableau: And how did that change with Tableau? Julio: When we started using Tableau, that completely changed. Jes\u00fas: Tableau doesn't have any limitations, it allows us to handle any kind of data and allows us great flexibility. We are able to handle a large volume of data from different platforms, even on different systems. Tableau: Can you give an example? Julio: So, for example, there are areas where we apply resources of heavy investment and we can analyze whether or not the process is in order. When we have a deviation or an exception, we automatically identify its origin in a very short time and we are able to take the appropriate action so that the error doesn't reoccur. Tableau: What are some of your favorite things about Tableau? Jes\u00fas: The main aspects are definitely the great ease of use and the fact that we don't depend on a technological development area to be able to carry out our analyses. Tableau: What are some of your favorite things about Tableau? Jes\u00fas: We haven't come across any other software on the market that enables us to have such a variety of graphs and dashboards. They provide us with all of the results that the organization wants in a very quick, interactive, and visual way. Julio: We can really measure the improvements that this tool has brought us by how we are able to identify our weaknesses during audits, how we are able to strengthen and test our standards to make sure they are efficient. Now we are about to easily manage a whole universe of data. Tableau: What would you do if you didn\u2019t have Tableau? Jes\u00fas: I think that if we didn't have Tableau then we'd have to go back to fully depending on the IT Department, to visualizing the data in a very flat way, in reports, we wouldn't have graphs, which are very suited to our needs. Not having that, the IT Department, for example, with its BI Department, would simply process statistical information, flat information that really doesn't quickly identify trends or process deviations. Tableau: How did your team react when they started using Tableau? Jes\u00fas: In fact, those in areas using Tableau are surprised when they come across a particular dashboard that shows them information from different systems or different platforms, and when they can visualize it in one single graph, they really can't understand how it happens. They say: \"I don't understand, how did they do that? How did they combine that information?\" Tableau: How has Tableau had a positive effect on the company? Jes\u00fas: Above all, having a number of tools, such as drill down, enables us to manage our graphs very quickly and to see different views and manage a large volume of data with practically a single click."

        "title": "Introducing Tableau to the SYSTEX family",
        "company": "SYSTEX Corporation",
        "content": "Founded in 1997, SYSTEX Corporation is a leading Taiwan-based IT services provider, with over 3,000 employees across Asia Pacific and 55 branch offices in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. In 2014, SYSTEX\u2019s consolidated revenue reached US$530 million. SYSTEX provides professional IT services to over 20,000 enterprise and government clients. The company also has a strong distribution network with over 1,500 channel partners. Known for its solid domain knowledge, the company offers more than 60 world-class hardware and software products. With Tableau, SYSTEX has: SYSTEX Corporation houses several business institutes\u2014 for instance, the Financial Business Institute (FBI), the Eco-system Business Institute (EBI), Consumer Business Institute (CBI), and the Value-added Business Institute (VBI)\u2014each with a focus on a unique business area. These institutes are designed to facilitate business practices and functions within their area of focus, streamlining operations across the company. SYSTEX Sales Director Vincent Chang oversees particular VBI product lines as well as the procurement and application of analytics software and tools. He and his team of seven were actively seeking a data analytics tool that could connect different data sources and standardize reporting. This effort was supported by SYSTEX President Frank Lin, who believes in returning data to the people who have produced it. He feels that data collected or generated in the field will prove useful to those working in it. \u201cIn a nutshell, the company leadership wants everyone in the company to be able to work with data like a data scientist,\u201d Chang said. Unfortunately, this attempt was challenging\u2014in part due to disparate systems of data collection and analysis that did not \u2019talk\u2019 to each other. SYSTEX\u2019s employees were using many different types of data analytics software and business intelligence systems based on work function and operational requirements. For instance, simple spreadsheets were used for budgeting and a complex ERP system was used for various internal operational requirements. SYSTEX became a Tableau re-seller in late 2014. As employees learned to use the drag-and-drop visual analytics software, interest in using Tableau grew internally. Chang\u2019s team took two months to thoroughly research and evaluate Tableau before deciding that it would be beneficial for the company. The team then held knowledge sessions with Lin to impress upon him that Tableau would make a useful business intelligence (BI) tool for everyone\u2014not just the IT department. SYSTEX\u2019s management decided to adopt Tableau across the company as the standard reporting BI tool in December 2014. Chang and his team organized workshops to help employees from human resources, finance, operations and other departments familiarize with Tableau through hands-on sessions. This approach brought the SYSTEX team to get up to speed on the software swiftly. Feedback from the participants have been really encouraging, according to Chang. \u201cDespite SYSTEX having a team of more than 400 information technology workers and engineers with multiple specialization qualifications, the company\u2019s management still recognized the need to equip everyone with analytics skills at their fingertips,\u201d said Chang. Currently, there are more than 40 Tableau Desktop licenses at SYSTEX. Many others are consuming Tableau content, and users come from all departments, including finance, sales, operations, human resources, as well as subsidiary companies. Chang and his team are among the heaviest of users, and Lin remains an avid supporter. Chang commented that almost everyone in the company is using Tableau in some capacity now. The impact that Tableau has on the company has been encouraging. According to staff feedback, time taken to generate reports have been reduced tremendously from one to two weeks previously to three to four hours currently. Tableau\u2019s interactive dashboards are \u2018groundbreaking\u2019 for many users as well, as they find themselves benefitting from self-service data analysis. Using the dashboards, users are able to find answers to their own questions in real time playing with the data visualizations. Tableau has also allowed SYSTEX staff to communicate better with one another across business units and departments rather than relying solely on IT department. \u201cOne very clear benefit was that the language of analysis has become consistent across the company. This allows for communication to be more coordinated, cutting back the time spent on convoluted communications across departments,\u201d said Chang. Finally, Tableau has also contributed to better efficiency for the SYSTEX teams in various job functions. \u201cTableau allows employees to save time on analysis when they generate reports. Our president, however, wants to inspire everyone to leverage Tableau to uncover deeper insights from the data, and not just bank on it to save time. He would like us not to just think of Tableau as a BI tool that can do what no other tools have done, but to really make use of it to discover insights and learnings, and to generate unique and actionable observations,\u201d Chang concluded."

        "company": "amaysim",
        "content": "amaysim is a leading Australian online-led Mobile Services Provider (MSP) that has grown from a startup to the fourth largest independent MSP in Australia by number of subscribers. The company sought a solution to empower non-technical business users of all skill levels to make data-driven decisions in real-time. Today at amaysim, business leaders and users have regular meetings to look at sales trends, renewal rates, port outs and other key metrics that drive the business. Using Tableau, amaysim was able to visualise critical business data to support senior decision making, improve workforce productivity and reduce time to insight. With a business model built on innovative technology, amaysim has garnered over 700,000 subscribers in less than five years. Such fast growth presented challenges as the organisation moved to analyse and obtain insights from all the data it collected. \"Data driven decision-making is one of the pillars of our business strategy,\u201d says Julian Dell, amaysim IT Director. amaysim has over 10 billion call data records, and this number grows by more than 20 million call data records daily. The data it stores is complex and comes from multiple sources including Livechat, Zendesk, call data records, Google Analytics and more. amaysim\u2019s previous BI methodology required coding which could not easily scale to business users. Insights could only be sought by one or two individuals within the organisation, so business gains were limited by resources and the time-intensive process. \u201cDue to the backlog of requests, if any executive asked a question, it could take the analysts weeks to get the data before they even could visualise it. Scalability wasn\u2019t where it needed to be,\u201d says Dell. Leaders recognised the bottom line value that amaysim could access by analysing its data, but the low productivity levels of the current solution stopped the team from fully realising this value. Decision makers set out to find a solution to help amaysim transform data into insight and use analytics to drive business performance. Adrian Loong joined amaysim in 2014 and was tasked with developing a BI strategy that suited amaysim and its needs. \u201cThe company wanted to stop looking back and start predicting the future,\u201d said Loong, \u201cTo encourage users across the organisation to embrace and get value from the technology, it was also important that the solution was visual and easy to use.\u201d He sought a solution that could provide senior executives with the ability to make data-driven decisions with real-time intelligence. It also needed to enable other business people in the organisation to seek data insights, rather than rely on highly skilled technicians to do all of the analysis. Having used Tableau at two previous organisations, it was easy for Loong to recommend Tableau. \u201cI introduced amaysim to Tableau in my first month at the company. I had tested other solutions but they were too slow, too expensive, or simply didn\u2019t meet the brief. I\u2019d had a great experience using Tableau in the past and knew it could deliver what amaysim was looking for,\u201d said Loong. Loong just had to demonstrate that capability to senior management. With one Tableau Desktop license, Loong did short proof of concepts (POC) with the new tools based on current business pain points. As an example, Loong used technology from Alteryx to combine disparate data sources before using Tableau to visualize the results in a dashboard to management. Tableau has enabled amaysim to speed up the traditional requirements gathering process. Today we focus on helping business users ask the right questions and getting insights from Tableau dashboards By continuously delivering results and insights to the management team, it was a straightforward decision for amaysim to adopt the Tableau solution. amaysim undertook an end-to-end replacement of their technology stack and now uses Amazon Redshift as their database, Alteryx to combine the data, and Tableau to visualise it. With Loong\u2019s experience using Tableau, it was a fast and simple process of introducing amaysim to the technology and rolling it out across the company. \u201cInitially it was only myself and a few directors using Tableau,\u201d said Loong. \u201cI offered informal training and the users picked it up very quickly.\u201d amaysim uses Tableau Desktop to visually analyse its data and Tableau Server for publishing and sharing finished work. \u201cWe introduced Tableau Server with collaboration in mind\u2014 to share dashboards and insights\u2014 while Tableau Desktop was intended for extensive slicing and dicing,\u201d said Loong. In the nine months since implementation, amaysim has seen vast improvements in workplace productivity and is able to make better educated business decisions, faster. \u201cThe technology works together to deliver what we need,\u201d said Loong. \u201cRedshift gives us the speed and robustness to store and analyse vast volumes of data. Alteryx combines the data which allows us to quickly iterate and gain insights in Tableau.\u201d No longer is it a two to three month process to get the answers they\u2019re searching for. Visualising the data allows any user to immediate identify the trends occurring within our business so we can act on it. \u201cWe can now build dashboards on the fly together with our business users\u201d said Loong. \u201cThe process can be completed within hours \u2014and it\u2019s rare for any organisation to be able to operate at that speed.\u201d \u201cThanks to Tableau and its ability to visualise critical business data, amaysim has made huge strides in its journey from reactive reporting to proactive decision support,\u201d said Loong. amaysim now has a three person analytics team covering a wide span of functions including finance; customer acquisition and retention marketing; plus retail and online sales. It is able to get the data it needs faster; projects that would have taken over two weeks now take a few hours. Using Tableau, amaysim can do more than save time, it has seen hard benefits that improve bottom line performance. \u201cA team member simply has to ask a question \u2013 such as \u2018why are customers leaving?\u2019 and the data can be sourced and presented by different products, channels, revenue spend, and more. Tableau helps us to present a clear answer,\u201d said Loong. amaysim is also empowering its business users to ask their own questions using Tableau\u2019s self-service data sources which significantly increase workplace productivity. Line of business users are encouraged to build their own dashboards and publish to tableau server for sharing. By enabling them to quickly build on a baseline of analytics, they can easily solve their own specific business problems and do not have to wait on BI teams. \u201cTraditionally BI is a bottleneck but our staff are excited that Tableau is so easy to use and they\u2019re able to seek these insights themselves. I trained one of our marketing analysts and within a few hours he went from zero understanding of the technology to building his own dashboard,\u201d said Loong. Many of amaysim\u2019s directors, business owners and business units currently use Tableau. Loong\u2019s goal is to enable the entire organisation to use Tableau and create their own visualisations. \u201cTableau supports creative problem solving by giving business leaders direct interaction and immediate feedback. Once a dashboard has been built, we don\u2019t just sit there and wait. We call a meeting with some of the senior executives and click through the dashboard to look for insights. Often it is after interacting with the dashboard that leads to further questions and drives robust discussion.\u201d Senior managers refer to a Tableau dashboard at the start of meetings. This allows them to review sales and identify opportunities or urgent areas for discussion. Using the new solution, amaysim is able to analyse and visualise data to answer a wide variety of questions, including: Loong is also moving towards a model of predictive analytics. \u201cUsing Tableau and Alteryx we plan to build predictive analytics and implement a slice and dice on product P&Ls within Tableau,\u201d said Loong. \u201cThat\u2019s a significant step forward and will offer us impressive insights into how to grow the business.\u201d Loong summarises, \u201cTableau helps us reduce the time to insight and accelerate the pace of decision-making. With Tableau we can empower non-technical business users to explore the data, investigate new angles on the fly giving rise to clearer thinking and better ideas. We continually find ways of driving greater operational efficiencies within our business.\u201d"

It's a must-have. Anyone that's involved with data analysis and investigating data, you have to have this tool. It is so powerful\u2014it's transformative. Tableau: Can you describe your job to me?\nJonathan: I am the production planning manager of Aer Lingus, Irish airline, Irish flag carrier. We look after basically the cabin crew, the flight operations, pilots\u2014essentially the rostering, the planning and have a role in terms of the maintenance engineering. We try to deliver the lowest cost per seat for our passengers to make sure that essentially we're a competitive airline going forward. Tableau: How long have you been there?\nJonathan: When I started, I was looking at basically the engine model, which was essentially looking at trying to optimize the value to Aer Lingus for the contract we have on that airline. So that was a very big spreadsheet, about 50 megabytes. It took about three weeks just to try and document the file, understand what it was, and it was a huge task. There's over a million different formulae in the spreadsheet. So it's huge. And we realized that we could actually save money by connecting the planning process, the daily planning process, with what we want to do in terms of delivering more activity on certain aircraft and less on others. And I said, 'Well, could I get access and use Tableau?' I'd seen it and said I wanted to get my hands on it. It was great. So I was then able to be a one-man-band in terms of looking at activity and developing dashboards, worksheets, whatever. I mean I think I have about a 60-page workbook that eventually evolved over a two or three month period, to really just see what was happening with each aircraft and each group of aircraft. And it evolved as I was tinkering with it. Tableau: Did using Tableau lead to any discoveries?\nJonathan: The interesting thing was, we thought we were doing well, and then we discovered there was this big negative cost. It was like, 'oh my God.' Suddenly you go and say, 'Okay, I've discovered a new aspect of engine cost that we hadn't realized.' Suddenly you're going, 'Bang, bang, bang, two minutes in Tableau\u201d and you can see the average per month, the average per day, and it's like, \u201cOh, wow\u2014we can do this slightly differently.' Within two days, I'd literally re-worked the whole instruction, sent it out to people, and off we went. As a result, it\u2019s been a very significant difference in terms of U.S. dollars. Tableau: How is Tableau different than other tools?\nJonathan: I\u2019ve spent probably 15-20 years summarizing data in Excel and getting it out there. And the knowledge that what I wanted to do is be free and unchain myself from the computer and actually analyze and liberate and actually educate, because that\u2019s essentially what you can do. You can show the trends, the graphical power is completely liberating. And actually it's more of an artistic experience. The flexibility you have is remarkable. It is limitless. I think it is extremely powerful and I would thoroughly recommend it."

They had a wealth of information, but accessing and interpreting it took too long. SEP chose Tableau\u2014with support from Tableau partner, ReSolt\u2014and decisions makers can now use data to support better decisions across the whole organization. In this video, Eduardo Huitr\u00f3n Chavarr\u00eda shares how Tableau has helped SEP: Tableau: What made you choose Tableau? Eduardo Huitr\u00f3n Chavarr\u00eda, Subdirector of IT: Having Tableau means that we instantly have the information we require. That's the area in which I feel that Tableau can and is helping us greatly. We needed to solve a very specific and very urgent issue, which was that our leaders needed to obtain management information so as to make the appropriate decisions. We did have an area that provided the information, but it took a long time generate it and, by the time we finally got it, we had already missed our opportunity. Tableau: What was the situation before Tableau? Eduardo: Our management had suffered as a result of not having this data from the moment the administration began, which was in 2012. We didn't have this data for about two years. As select information it represented a huge problem for us because we had an Excel spreadsheet, an Excel spreadsheet with thousands of formulas, thousands of filters, and about 50 different things that we needed the department involved to be there to interpret for us, we were struggling, basically. Tableau: And how has Tableau changed that process? Eduardo: Well, the transformation that we have seen since using Tableau is that we get the results immediately: it just takes a couple of clicks and we can see everything, we have everything, we don't rely on anybody else. That's the big advantage that we have now with Tableau. Tableau: What reactions have you received within the organization? Eduardo: We have gained the recognition of the staff at the Sub-secretariat, because the only people who see the information are the higher authorities. So, we've gained a little ground there in terms of credibility because it was also\u2026We were taking a gamble with something new, we were being pioneers and we demonstrated that it was what we needed. Tableau: How would you like to move forward with Tableau? Eduardo: We are being a little aggressive there. What I want now, in my position at the Secretariat, is for us to show all our results and for Tableau to be the platform. And I want it to be the platform for presenting our results, for data analysis. Tableau: How has Tableau changed the way that SEP uses data? Eduardo: Anybody is able to understand the reports that we generate using Tableau. Practically none of our seniors are technical staff. None of them are. And despite this, they understand them right away. They can use the data right away. And they find all of the data to be very, very clear, because it was generated precisely with that in mind. Tableau: Is there a specific area that you find Tableau to be particularly useful? Eduardo: There are definitely areas in which Tableau is particularly useful: in the delivery of resources to entities that are earmarked for specific programs. Tableau: Would you recommend Tableau? Eduardo: I would definitely recommend Tableau because it gives you immediate results. We no longer need to work on projects in the way in which we used to in Mexico, particularly within the government, they were very long. Tableau: How did you hear about ReSolt consulting services? Eduardo: Our experience with ReSolt came about as we had been looking at different products. And, luckily, a mutual friend introduced us to ReSolt\u2019s people, to some extent we were also looking for a business partner to get involved with us. Tableau: How have you used ReSolt\u2019s services in combination with Tableau? Eduardo: Well, one of the most important, or most impressive, features of ReSolt is that they execute their projects quickly. They get results quickly. And, well, Tableau was the perfect combination. Working with them has been very pleasant. Tableau: Can you explain? Eduardo: The support that ReSolt offered us, or offers us, has so far been the biggest help, we have had their full support at all times. They have supported us in everything we have needed. The fact that ReSolt gives us that kind of support gives Tableau an added extra. We were looking for products that would provide us with management information as, at the time, we didn't have one, and someone introduced us to ReSolt. They introduced us to ReSolt and ReSolt introduced us to Tableau."

And that's a tool that helps organizations to do personal development, professional development, and organizational development. For each individual in an organization, we generate 301 data points using the Birkman Method and Tableau is fantastic for helping us analyze that data, visualize that data, identify outliers, identify trends, identify gaps and so on. Tableau: What do those visualizations look like?\nJon: One of the very simple but powerful visualizations that we get within the Birkman tool sort of straight out of the box is the thing we call the lifestyle grid. And it's a way of mapping any group of people. So it could be 3 people, it could be 300 people. So what would be great would be to be able to map one person's usual behavior on the grid alongside someone else's need. And using Tableau, I can do that very easily. Tableau: Has Tableau had a positive impact?\nJon: I may need to look something up, but then I'm straight into the analysis and very little time spent preparing data and working out how could we possibly do this because it's all built into Tableau. And it's very, very simple, but in terms of the impact it has on actual behavior and understanding of behavior is enormous. So it really turns the lights on for people. Tableau: Has Tableau impacted the way that you interact with clients?\nJon: Tableau is really about how we can see what the data is trying to tell us. So, actually, we're using Tableau sort of behind the scenes to get at the answers that we can then communicate in a way that the client gets. Tableau: Do you have an example of a problem that you solved in Tableau?\nJon: One of our clients in the U.K., was a very fast-growing consultancy group. And they had grown. It was a particular group of people who'd started this\u2014this business who all had a common background. And, basically, they ran out of people with their background they could hire. So they started hiring, those days, Big Five and Big Four consultancy group consultants. So these people had been very successful in Big Four or Big Five consultancy setting really didn't fit in this organization. Tableau: How did you utilize Tableau?\nJon: We were able to do some benchmarking for them saying, you know, these are the people we're trying to reproduce, these are the people that aren't working out so well. Can you surface any key characteristics? There were about a dozen that had some bearing on it. But there were two or three that were really critical that fell out very quickly from looking at this data in Tableau and the difference it made to the client when we started applying this in their recruitment. I think the difference it's made is, as I say, being able to sit down and say to a client, \"Look, this is it.\" And start to explore the data with a client is very powerful. Tableau: What would you do if you didn\u2019t have Tableau?\nJon: My life wouldn't stop if Tableau wasn't there. But my life would sort of go back a couple of centuries in some ways if it wasn't there. I'm very glad there's a world where Tableau exists."

        "content": "Tableau: What is the benefit of \u201cliberating data\u201d and enabling self-service business intelligence?\nSteve Roy, IT Director: We're not thinking about how we're going to do things, we're thinking of what can we show people that helps them be effective. And that's kind of a quantum leap. Keith Rabin, President: My primary goal is to make everyone at the company as effective doing their job every day as they possibly can be. I think we've realized over time that centralizing all of that data and trying to have one centralized group come up with all of the data-driven decision making just no longer works. And it's slow, too\u2014it's extraordinarily slow. So we have to drive that decision-making and that power down to our managers, and they have to ultimately be responsible for it. In order to do that, you have to give them a tool that allows them to take these big data sets that come from different systems and different databases and be able to connect them all together and see the data that they need to see to make their decisions. Steve: Trying to deliver effective KPIs for the organization has been, you know, the Holy Grail for our organization for a number of years. And it really is \u2018the secret sauce\u2019 for most organizations. And we believe that we've achieved that. People are rallying around the visualizations that we've created, and they understand what's going on with the business. Kevin Cape, Manager, Corporate Soul: In order to connect to people, to the impact that they're having, you have to be able to measure that. You have to be able to show what that impact is. We're able to look at those boards every day and see what's happening and think about what we're doing on the front lines and how our tasks relate to that. We're able to filter things up and say, \"Hey, you know, I saw this, I had this experience. And based on what I see on the boards, I think we can improve in this way.\" Tableau: What made you choose the hosted version of our Server product, Tableau Cloud?\nSteve: The concept of being mobile and accessing data is what it's all about these days. We wanted to liberate the data and get it out to our users. And the way that we did that was through Tableau Cloud. I'm not having to worry about firewalls and configuring things correctly. It's there in the cloud, secure for my key executives to access anytime\u2014even on a JetSuite aircraft at 40,000 feet. To go out and find the talent, purchase the equipment, get everything up and running, the time to delivering the solution just wasn't realistic on the timeline that we had. Tableau Cloud just made a lot of sense for us. We could get there quicker, we could get there faster, and really at about the same price. With Tableau Cloud we're able to focus on the actual reporting pieces of it. We don't have to maintain the servers and offer IT support in that role. Tableau: As an analyst, what do like about having Tableau?\nMatt Waterman, Mission Support Analyst: It gives us the ability to devote that much more time to our end users and really focus on the data itself. Right off the bat (it was) very easy to use, was able to get all kinds of results in literally days, which was amazing. We were using some other tools to do that and it took a matter of weeks or months to even compile that data, and (with Tableau) we were able to do that in a quarter\u2014if not less\u2014of the time. The senior level executives were just astounded. Tableau: Can you describe the importance of helping people to better understand and connect with data through visualization?\nKevin: Transparency in the data is about knowing what's actually going on in the business. It becomes participatory and it allows people to connect their work to their meaning and to the progress of the business. As human beings, we look at numbers and they're symbols that just aren't as meaningful. They don't have that same oomph. And when something is visual, when you can see a visual gap in a chart, there's a loss aversion there that you look at and you say, \"Oh, we've got to close that gap, there's something meaningful about those two lines touching.\" Tableau: It sounds like Tableau has become a major part of how you do business, then\u2014would you agree?\nKeith: The first thing I do in the morning when I wake up is pull up my e-mail and there are three reports that Tableau has generated in there. And they're the three critical metrics of our business. And it's the first thing I do is look at them and determine if there's any decisions that need to be made from them. And if there are, I probably call our CEO, Alex, and we talk about it. There's all kinds of decisions that are happening faster. I would say more accurate. And those are the things you have to have in business today."

        "content": "Dentsu is the number one advertising company in the Japanese market, managing advertising campaigns for a variety of local and global brands. To track campaign performance, Dentsu analyzes hundreds of millions of records each month. Before Tableau, Dentsu used SAS and SPSS to create reports from four types of data: TV, online, survey, and purchasing. Analysts visualized the data in Excel and distributed reports in PowerPoint. Now Dentsu produces reports using Tableau and Hadoop, allowing clients to see and interact with their campaign data\u2014all in one place. In this video, Shigeki Yamazaki, Technical Director, explains how Dentsu is increasing client trust with fast and high-quality reporting in Tableau. Tableau: What kind of customers do you serve at Dentsu? Shigeki Yamazaki, Technical Director: It\u2019s an advertising agency. My job involves building data platforms at the data solutions center, creating business such as analysis with data visualization. When it comes to Dentsu customers, we have major clients from various industries placing ads with us. It\u2019s wide-ranging, from the automotive and beverage industries to telecommunications carriers. Tableau: What was your goal when you first started using Tableau? Yamazaki: We want to deliver more effective services to clients by pursuing integrated analysis including mass communication. It\u2019s not possible to take action on things that can\u2019t be seen, so they should be made visible. Tableau: How has Tableau helped you communicate with different types of clients? Yamazaki: When it comes to places that hold a lot of data, traditional companies such as those in the manufacturing industry accumulate a vast amount of undisclosed data. While we wanted to take advantage of this, we were under pressure to look into the means to do so, the means to actually do so. Using Tableau for this, there have been many cases where we can aggregate data on the system and visualize and use it there and then. Tableau: What tools do you use to aggregate the data? Yamazaki: For example, by using a number of services such as Amazon Redshift and cloud services such as Treasure Data, it is possible to use mechanisms that can quickly and stably aggregate and process even a great amount of data, and run these without paying the initial costs. After becoming able to process large amounts of data, Tableau can be used to see it. Tableau: How have these improvements made an impact at Dentsu? Yamazaki: We were able to focus on thinking about the data. By being able to focus on it, the work that previously took several days could be shrunk to several hours by turning it into one process. We became able to produce higher-quality reports after repeating this process many times. Tableau: Several days to several hours\u2014that\u2019s great! How will Tableau continue to impact the company? Yamazaki: And I think the level of creative expressiveness is unique to Tableau. I think that we\u2019ll think of data creatively from here on, not just from a marketing standpoint. We really became aware that Tableau can express the importance of what is happening now creatively, in infographics. This was the first chance we had to use it. While this improved the client satisfaction, more importantly, by using Tableau, we could deliver to clients in Tableau format by distributing Tableau Reader. It is great that clients can use can use interactive tools and have such flexibility, and using new tools and technology leads to new relationships of trust. Tableau: Can you explain how you use data at your job? Shigeki Yamazaki, Technical Director: It\u2019s an advertising agency. My job involves building data platforms at the data solutions center, creating business such as analysis with data visualization. There are lots of records each month, hundreds of millions or billions. Naturally we also manage these, analyzing the data in such records and sending reports. Tableau: What types of data do you analyze in Tableau? Yamazaki: Up to now we\u2019ve analyzed a combination of four types of data using SAS and SPSS: TV and online data, as well as survey data and actual purchasing data. We visualize it in Excel and create reports in PowerPoint. However, all of this can be done on Tableau. This was the decisive factor for us to introduce it. We were quite shocked at a tool that could easily import and connect so much data and visualize it. Tableau: Want did your process look like before Tableau? Yamazaki: When we carried out data analysis, we used 80% of the total time to collect, store, accumulate and aggregate the data. From 70% to around 80%. However, with this taking up 80% of the total time, we only had 20% of time to consider the data. This was extremely limited. Tableau: And how has Tableau improved the process? Yamazaki: Consequently, using Hadoop for this, by using Tableau for the visualization part, we were able to exponentially increase this 20%. The quality of the reports themselves for the analysis results naturally increased."

        "company": "HotelQuickly",
        "content": "The revolution in data and analytics is changing what businesses know about their customers. At the same time, more travelers choose mobile, meaning travel businesses have to engage and reach customers in new ways. A study by Lenovo found that about 59 percent of people in Asia searched for travel accommodation online via mobile devices\u201413 percent above the global average. HotelQuickly is one company that has combined mobility and travel with great success. The company taps into the spontaneous side of human nature by providing a mobile-only private sales channel that offers same-day accomodations. Last-minute bookings mean that hotels are willing to grant steep discounts to HotelQuickly members. Based in Hong Kong, the company currently serves the Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam markets, featuring more than 6,000 hotels. The app is localized to six different languages, including Bahasa, English, Thai, Vietnamese, as well as simplified and traditional Chinese. As HotelQuickly\u2019s operations expanded over the last two years, the amount of data the team had to crunch\u2014from customer information to hotel rates\u2014had grown tremendously. The company\u2019s largest data sets have hundreds of millions of rows in a single table. One of the earliest business challenges the Business Intelligence team faced was helping management make fast, informed decisions. \u201cAs we run many partnership campaigns, we have to analyze the performance of each campaign and share our findings on a weekly basis,\u201d said Peter Varga, Head of Business Intelligence, HotelQuickly. \u201cWe could not do this prior to having Tableau.\u201d Another challenge was preparing reports for investors in a timely manner. \u201cWe used to spend a lot of time exporting data to Microsoft Excel worksheets,\u201d said Peter. This left little time to spend exploring the data for additional insights. The team at HotelQuickly started looking for the right business intelligence (BI) tool to support their work in the second half of 2014. \u201cWe tried other BI software but found that most did not have good visual analytics capabilities and it was quite difficult to start working with them. I stumbled across Gartner\u2019s 2014 Magic Quadrant for BI and Analytics Platform during my search, and saw Tableau in the top right quadrant, which effectively positions it as a leader in its space, and that piqued my interest. I reached out to few other leading companies in the Magic quadrant and after reviewing the competing products, Tableau felt clearly as a superior solution to our needs. By the time it took me to figure out how to even connect to data in other solutions I was already gaining interesting insights into our data in Tableau thanks to it simple, intuitive drag & drop interface,\u201d Peter commented. Peter went on to download the free trial version, and to his delight, he found it to be very intuitive. He then introduced Tableau to his BI team, which is made up of BI analysts and a developer. \u201cIt\u2019s the ability to connect seamlessly to the various data sources (Amazon Redshift in our case), do analysis and gain valuable insights very quickly that made Tableau very attractive to us,\u201d said Peter. Since choosing Tableau, Peter\u2019s team has worked with as much as half a billion rows of data using Tableau. \u201cI was very pleasantly surprised by the speed of Tableau and ability to interact with even big data in almost real-time fashion,\u201d he said. The team uses Tableau to develop weekly and monthly reports that they share with the entire company. The reports feature sales figures and updates from top management and country managers, marketing and financial data, along with other growth updates. The comprehensive dashboards make sharing complex information with the rest of the company a much easier task. Peter said: \u201cTableau has this ability to create \u2018stories\u2019 so I\u2019ve started to create monthly data-driven \u2018Story of HotelQuickly in last month. This quickly became favorite monthly reading of company executive leadership getting company-wide acknowledgement as \u2018the best monthly BI update we've ever had at HQ\u2014very insightful\u2019 from our CEO and CTO. This has definitely inspired me to keep pushing and innovating frontiers of what we are capable of doing in BI department.\u201d \u201cPeople really love the ability to get fresh regular data-driven insights beautifully visualized. To give an example of how team members appreciate the data value Tableau allows \u2013 I\u2019m now always invited to kick off the regular weekly marketing call with 5-10 minutes of data driven insights of last week,\u201d he added. HotelQuickly has demonstrated how a mobile start-up can fully embrace data to stay ahead of competition. \u201cWe pride ourselves on having the best prices in the market. Tableau has helped us stay competitive by making the time to develop and deliver insightful analysis and reports significantly shorter. We now have weekly reporting that details KPIs and shows us how the booking patterns have changed, details on revenue and commission, conversion rates and so on,\u201d Peter elaborated. \u201cOur business, which is highly metric-driven, is optimized with Tableau\u2019s rapid-fire data analytics and drag-and-drop functions as we can now compare period-on-period metric,\u201d he added. According to Peter, Tableau is also a powerful tool because of its cross-platform adaptability. \u201cTableau is perfect for our business. Its beautiful dashboards can be mobile-optimized, which makes it easy for our colleagues to access the findings even on the go. Tableau basically has the power to give us any insights we are looking for from the data that we can get our hands on,\u201d he said. HotelQuickly plans to adopt Tableau more widely across its operations in line with its growth plans. Peter commented: \u201cAs we look to introduce changes in marketing, public relations and product development, we are definitely planning to expand the use of Tableau across different functions, using it in broader and deeper ways to extract the best insights for the team.\u201d Peter is also impressed by the quality of customer service he received in the early days of using Tableau. \u201cThe account manager whom I was in touch with was very pleasant, helpful, even fun, and always responded to my queries in a timely and professional manner. The Tableau support team and online community are also really supportive by offering troubleshooting advice,\u201d he said. For companies that are looking for a BI tool that appeals to non-technical users, Peter has some suggestions. \u201cConsider what you want to achieve with your BI tool of choice, then go ahead and try the free version out and see if you like it. With Tableau, you will see the difference quite quickly. The entire online training is free\u2014I found the webinars to be really useful in helping my team and myself to pick up the tool quickly. Our new intern got from zero to ability to really contribute with Tableau analysis in almost no time,\u201d he concluded."

Before Tableau, analysts stored data in individual Excel documents, making insight into gigabytes of data time-consuming and difficult. Business leaders were dependent on analysts for any access to data. If an analyst was out for a day, questions would go unanswered. Today, with a combination of Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server, Multimedios Redes has: In video 1, Carlos Rodriguez, Head of Monitoring and Business Offers, talks about how visualizing technician movements let his team identify opportunities for savings. In video 2, Edgar Schwartz, Head of Information, describes how the company has changed its approach to data with Tableau. Tableau: What return has Tableau given Multimedios Redes? Edgar Schwartz, Head of Information: The return that Tableau has given us is definitely that of meeting our needs for the visualization of indicators, something which was previously very limited. Tableau: How does your company use Tableau? Carlos Rodriguez, Head of Monitoring and Business Offers: You can take a few gigabytes of data, which used to take a long time to process, and with Tableau you can process it practically online and play around with the data and see it in graphs the way we want. Tableau: Can you give an example of when you used Tableau to help solve a problem? Edgar: Tableau has been very helpful in geographically referencing our customers. We use nodes to provide our service and those nodes, we have even made the connection between climate temperature, or room temperature. And this has led us to, for example, a node might fail on a very hot day. And this means calls from angry customers because the node has failed and their internet is slow, their phone isn't working, or the image is blurry. Tableau: How do you track that in Tableau? Edgar: Thanks to Tableau, we have been able to reference those points and cross-reference data, for example, combine the geo-referencing of node with the failure with the calls. Then we combine all of this data and we obtain the support or the indicator data we require to make decisions. Tableau: Have you had any surprising moments in Tableau? Carlos: We looked at the maps, for example, the movements of our technicians, our fleet of technicians, where they were being called out to our customers. When we saw a map of their movements, how they were moving around, for example: from downtown to the west side and then on to another part of the city, we realized: \"There's a window of opportunity here, we're making a mistake.\" We hadn't noticed it before by just looking at the numbers. When we saw it plotted on a map, it came to our attention and we began to deal with it. Tableau: Did you get a positive reaction? Carlos: As the technicians have increased their productivity, they are making more commission. So, everyone's happy. Tableau: How has this impacted the company? Edgar: All of this means we have saved fuel and time, we have prevented failures, we have reduced the cost of call-centers. Tableau: How does Tableau fit into Multimedios Redes\u2019 future? Carlos: Now, for the future, I think that discovering Tableau has changed my perspective and I think we are going to strengthen our knowledge of this tool and keep using it, we are going to become more specialized and continue to grow with Tableau. If Tableau grows, we grow and the company grows. Tableau: What reactions did you get when your team started using Tableau? Edgar: The reactions we got at the first meetings in which we used the tool were literally \"Wow, what is that?\" And we said that it was Tableau, a BI visualization software, and they were amazed, especially when we started by showing them geo-referenced data. That was something that we had never been able to do, you know? Where in the city we were procuring, where in the city we had failures or needed to open branches. Tableau: Is Tableau catching on within the company? Edgar: Now when we present an Excel, management asks us: \"Why don't you do it in Tableau?\" Or when we give them any indicator or short report, they say: \"When can I have it in Tableau?\" Tableau: What did your process look like before Tableau? Edgar: The way it has changed how the analysts use their time, for example, to use the tool, we used to just use Excel and all of the data would be stored on one analyst's laptop. If the analyst wasn't there it was very difficult to access and update the data for management, or for our internal users or clients. Tableau: How has that changed? Edgar: Now, with Tableau, the information is on the server, because we have Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server. And this means we can download the workbook and work with it without the user, the analyst, who uploaded that data being there. The only thing you have to give it is the database or the data and then literally play around with the data until you reach the point where your analysis is complete. Tableau: What would happen if you didn\u2019t have Tableau? Edgar: If we didn't have Tableau we would still be working how we were working five years ago. And we wouldn't be able to carry out the measurement of indicators that the company requires. And that would mean that the data wouldn't flow in the same way. And that would mean that decisions wouldn't be taken in the same way. And so, the company would come to a standstill in terms of data. Tableau: How would you describe the effect that Tableau has had? Edgar: With that data and Tableau, we have the power of data. We have the power of knowing where to attack, and when. Tableau: How so? Edgar: Now the directors and different areas of the company come to us as analysts to ask us what is best for the company in decision making. Now it's not so much \"Give me the data so I can see how I am doing.\" Now they ask us: \"What do you see?\""

The Texas-based company provides energy services to all sectors of the oil, gas, utility, and power industries. Strike\u2019s integrated network of energy services ranges from upstream production, processing and gathering facilities, to high pressure transmission and distribution lines. A rapidly growing company, Strike needed a versatile digital architecture that didn't require major investments of time or money. In video 1, Megan Pate, Director of Business Information, talks about how the company uses Tableau Server to \u201cbring together information from all different systems\u201d to achieve a single source of truth. In video 2, Megan talks about partnering with Teknion Data Solutions, a business consulting firm based in Irving, Texas to help implement their data solution. With Tableau, Strike is able to: Tableau: What attracted you to Tableau? Megan Pate, Director of Business Information: Strike has enjoyed some tremendous growth in the past several years. We like to say that the only constant is constant change. And so we were really looking for nimble architecture and something that did not provide high cost or high time, high investment, barriers to entry. We needed something that could be changed down the road as requirements changed. Tableau: Who at Strike uses Tableau? Megan: Our Tableau users are spread out among various departments and also at various levels. We have everybody from C-level execs to analysts that use Tableau. Tableau: Who's using that data? Megan: We have everyone from executives, so our CEOs are looking at the data, all the way down to someone working in a small shop somewhere. The data typically contains all kinds of variables and each person is different in the level of detail they want to get to. So some like to dig in and get to the very bottom and others are just happy with a single snapshot. Tableau: What kind of access to data did your clients have before you adopted Tableau? Megan: Strike was coming from a background of having little to no data access for our users. So we were really coming from an environment with no BI to trying to put something in place for folks. We had users who were not able to get access to information that was really pertinent to their jobs. We had a mature security model, so we were looking for a way to empower users to get the access that they needed without having to give them the keys to the kingdom, per se. Tableau: What advantages does Tableau give you? Megan: Tableau allows us to quickly prototype and test and experiment with different reporting options, different data sources in a way that really removes that barrier of cost and time and resources. We work with data from all aspects of the organization and all of our source systems. So from our ERP to our field ticketing system which brings in daily equipment and labor hours from the field, to one of the more interesting data sets I've had to work with is we have a GPS tracking system on our fleet, so our trucks and equipment. And that's provided a lot of really great insights. We can visualize when trucks are idle versus running versus not moving. We can see when they are on a yard versus not on a yard or on a job versus not on a job. So we've been to see that GPS data in a way that we just weren't able to see it from the provider's portal, and then mash that up with our existing data. It has allowed us to bring together information from all of our different systems so that we are really looking from a single source of truth in the organization. And that's been absolutely critical for us. Tableau: Where do you get the most value from Tableau? Megan: The ability to prototype and build things quickly and then change them down the road has really been what we see as a huge value in Tableau. Tableau allows us to solve problems today that might not otherwise be solved. And that's definitely a win for us. Tableau: Do you have any advice for anyone just getting started with data analytics? Megan: If I could give advice to folks that are maybe starting from nothing, it's definitely to find a good partner. We're about a year into our project now, and I can pretty definitively say that we would probably still be trying to find the right resources if we had tried to find them all internally. So working with a partner, we were able to really gain the expertise and start using best practices from day one so that we didn't make mistakes in the beginning that would haunt us later on. Tableau: How did Teknion help you? Megan: We got connected with Teknion\u2014that really solidified the path that we had chosen. The first thing that worked on with them was working on the data warehouse and some master data management projects, and then moving into analytics and Tableau usage for the organization. We would definitely feel the pain if we didn't have Tableau and the warehouse that Teknion has built for us. The nimble architecture has been absolutely critical. About a month into starting the project with Teknion, we upgraded our ERP. A lot of the source data changed and had to be remapped. We knew that that change was coming, but we didn't want to delay the project. And they were able to remap everything and really didn't have any down time in the project because of the tools that we were using. Tableau: Can you tell me about a success story? Megan: One of the more concrete examples of the way that our company has used Tableau and Tableau Server fairly quickly, we recently moved buildings. We were now spread out by three floors and nobody knew where anybody sat anymore. And the company was about to invest between $10,000 and $15,000 on this new video directory system that would sit by the elevators and tell people where they were. I convinced them to give us a week and try to build something in Tableau. Teknion actually helped us out with that. And in a couple of days, they were able to build an interactive corporate directory with hover-overs and you can click and e-mail the person and everybody can have it embedded in their SharePoint intranet at their desk, and find out where everybody else sits. That was done in just a couple of days and really made that investment in the system that not required. Tableau: It sounds like partnering with Teknion has been critical for your success. Megan: Especially if you're starting a BI project from scratch, I can't recommend highly enough finding a good partner that works for you. They really kept us from making mistakes early on that we would probably still be paying for. That's something that you just can't put a price on."

Tableau: How are you using Tableau?\nDr. Alkadi: We brought the databases related to the students, the databases related to the HR, Human Resources, the database related to career development, databases related to scholarships\u2014because we\u2019ve been sending many of our TAs or lecturers abroad\u2014and now we have more than eight hundred persons are studying abroad all over the world, even into research databases related to research, databases that are related to appointments. Linking all those information using Tableau I think would maximize the efficiency of everything, reduce your cost and also would give you the right answer in decision whenever it's needed. That's how we're using it and using Tableau to read through those databases, although they are not integrated, but we used Tableau to go and read from those databases and do the analysis that we're looking for. Tableau: What is one of your favorite features in Tableau?\nDr. Alkadi: The interface also is customized where you can I mean do an interface that would help those who would like to use certain languages whether it\u2019s Arabic or any language. Tableau: Where did you learn about Tableau?\nDr. Alkadi: I saw this company, Bilytica\u2014I have to acknowledge them for to introducing Tableau. After I saw Tableau I said that\u2019s it, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been looking for the last few years, so to me it\u2019s something, I mean big, it saved me time. When I say \"saved me,\" it saved the institution time, money, effort. Tableau: Can you share a specific project where you are using Tableau?\nDr. Alkadi: We are using sensors especially with the valuable devices. So we have very expensive equipment, which need to be monitored and traced, so we\u2019re linking that not only that, who is using it, not only that, we\u2019re linking it also to the maintenance, to the functionality. Tableau: How do you increase efficiency with Tableau?\nDr. Alkadi: I mean, one of the colleges is having that equipment, it\u2019s used once a year, for example, so letting other people that we are having this device with this functionality might help those people to use it to maximize the usage of that device. So linking all those information using Tableau I think would maximize the efficiency of everything, reduce your cost and also would give you the right answer in decision whenever it\u2019s needed."

        "content": "Spil Games, which publishes and distributes mobile games to more than 100 million monthly users, was playing a game closer to home. It was called, \u201cHow do we get answers from all of our data?\u201d The goal was to build dashboards based on multiple data sources quickly and easily, in order to drive data-driven decisions on a daily basis. Tableau enables everyone in the company\u2014from analytics, marketing and advertising to content management and publishing\u2014to visualize their data, gain insight and get answers to their data questions. One of the main use cases is to improve the user gaming experience. As users move through the portal, Tableau is used to report on where they bounce and why. Subsequent tuning to gaming widgets or changes to the navigation reduce this friction and enhance the gaming. By identifying non-performing marketing campaigns, the company has achieved a 500 percent return on investment from its search engine advertising spend. Moreover, Spil Games can produce a report in 15 minutes now, compared with one week previously. Release the hidden diamonds. Guide the monkey through the jungle. Search for the good guys in the forest. These are just some of the escapades enjoyed by players of the Spil Games portfolio of mobile games. However, those adventures also mirror how difficult it was for the company to get answers to its data before Tableau was introduced. Spil Games, headquartered in the Netherlands, publishes and distributes games to more than 100 million monthly users. And games like Troll Face Quest, My Dolphin Show and Uphill Rush are drawing in ever-more audiences, especially from mobile gaming applications. For Derek Willemsen, Manager of Reporting and Analytics at Spil Games, this success creates massive volumes of data. And the problem was what to do with it. \u201cWe had a goldmine of data, but we weren\u2019t using it,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen I joined the company, we were relying on various different platforms to analyse and report on our data, including Google Analytics and spreadsheets. As a result, we had a multitude of different dashboards which complicated and delayed decision-making. Our goal was to build dashboards based on multiple data sources quickly and easily. That would help drive data-driven decisions on a daily basis.\u201d It was time to invest more in business intelligence (BI). The data they wanted to learn more about included everything from game loading times and search engine advertising optimization, to user demographics. At the time, Spil Games already had a BI tool in place for dashboards, but when you consider it took 44 clicks simply to update one dashboard, it was clear things needed to change. The first step was to deploy an HP Vertica enterprise data warehouse (EDW) as a data source for reporting. The main reporting table in this 35 terabytes EDW, which contains aggregated data on multiple levels, currently has currently approximately 900 million rows. The single largest table contains up to 25 billion rows of raw clickstream data. More than 100 data sources are integrated with the EDW. The final piece in the jigsaw was to make data analysis faster, easier and self-service. Which is where Tableau comes in. \u201cWe did some market research, tested a few tools and chose Tableau as our partner,\u201d says Willemsen. \u201cIt was by far and away the right choice. Tableau enables everyone in the company to visualize the data, gain insight and get answers to their data questions.\u201d Spil Games started small, with a Tableau Server license and 10 Desktop licenses. This has quickly grown to 25 Desktop licenses, equivalent to about one-fifth of the company\u2019s staff. All business-facing departments (analytics, marketing, advertising, content management, partner management, public relations, and publishing), and the Spil Games leadership team use Tableau to understand their data. Some engineering departments, including payments and portal management, also rely on Tableau. There is managed self-service BI stack, where power users can answer their own questions and make their own dashboards using Tableau Desktop, using predefined datasets. These are then shared with everyone in the organization by publishing them to Tableau Server. The HP EDW collects data from all directions: an Event Tracker which tracks user activity on the website, the production system for user account information and payments, external sources such as advertising partners and Google Analytics. Using Tableau, the team is able to visualize and query this data almost any way they choose. The team uses data extracts\u2014compressed snapshots of the data loaded into Tableau\u2019s Data Engine\u2014to enable rapid performance and offline data analysis. There are currently approximately 150 Tableau Workbooks, with more than 400 views available. Currently, three members of the team create and edit reports on a daily basis and manage new data sources. Some 22 teammates use Tableau Desktop on a regular basis to gain insights and custom reports based on published data sources. Tableau now powers informed, accurate and agile decision-making across the company. One of the main use cases is to improve the user gaming experience. As users move through the portal, Tableau is used to report on where they bounce and why. Subsequent tuning to gaming widgets or changes to the navigation reduce this friction and enhance the gaming. Tableau also visualizes reports on the users themselves, including the demographics of the users of each game, who is currently active among the registered users and game load times. Marketing teams use this analysis to optimize the content portfolio and increase the customers\u2019 lifetime value. Among many other use cases, Tableau is also used to increase the return on investment from search engine advertising and optimize search engine keywords. Analysis of the return on investment from individual campaigns is now being used to determine where campaign investment is required\u2014and where it might be trimmed. \u201cThe great thing about Tableau is that there are no barriers anymore surrounding our data. The team at Spil Games can focus more on defining the right questions, and coming up with new opportunities to improve our business. The software is transformative.\u201d He continues, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to single out the value of Tableau from the overall BI strategy,\u201d says Willemsen. \u201cWhat we can see is that together they have had a dramatic impact on our search engine advertising model. By identifying non-performing marketing campaigns, the company has achieved a 500 percent return on investment from its search engine advertising spend.\u201d Answers are reached much more quickly now too. \u201cWe can produce a report in 15 minutes now, whereas before it would take a week,\u201d he adds. \u201cMost of the time is normally spent fine-tuning the reports, such as formatting, actions and tooltips. In the unlikely event a problem occurs in one of the personalized local market gaming portals, we will also know about it within 15 minutes. That insight supports a high performance, more rewarding gaming environment.\u201d Tableau is also proving to be immensely popular with the users. \u201cThey all love Tableau. We haven\u2019t had to do much training in the tool itself; more time is spent on educating the team on how to use the data sets and define the analytical questions. As we move forward, the emphasis will be on continuing to train our Tableau Desktop users and improving the data analytics.\u201d Where would Willemsen be without Tableau? \u201cI probably would quit my job!\u201d he says with a smile."

        "company": "Vente-Exclusive",
        "content": "Vente-Exclusive has \u201csomething new to sell every day,\u201d as Product Manager, Wouter Cuypers puts it. The flash-sale online store leads the market in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. \u201cWe are not a regular e-commerce retailer with a warehouse full of goods,\u201d Wouter says. \u201cWe reserve stock at suppliers, which means we come up with deals with them to sell some of their goods at heavily-reduced prices on our website.\u201d After each sale ends, Vente-Exclusive makes one big order from the supplier, then handles the logistics of shipping each order. The site runs three to six different sales each day. \u201cOur chart [of sales and revenue] fluctuates every day, and it\u2019s correlated with the brands we have on sale. And this makes analyzing data at Vente-Exclusive quite a challenge,\u201d Wouter says. Two years ago, the business found itself overwhelmed with data. It had billions of data points on customer behavior, email campaigns, and shipping logistics, but it had no way to gain timely insights. Vente-Exclusive found a solution in Google Cloud Platform, a family of products on a pay-as-you-go model. \u201cWe immediately became interested in the various components of Google Cloud Platform that work very well together,\u201d Wouter says. Google\u2019s Cloud Storage provided unlimited data storage. Compute Engine enabled high-performance data processing. And BigQuery allowed for fast SQL queries of huge data sets. \u201cBigQuery is an analyst\u2019s dream,\u201d says Wouter. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with data that\u2019s billions of points in size. You query them and in just a few seconds, you\u2019ve got your answer\u2014unbelievable. And it\u2019s very easy to use.\u201d But even with this new data management architecture, Vente-Exclusive had a missing link: how to present the data to business users who don\u2019t have any SQL knowledge? \u201cFirst we wanted to do this in Excel, but that didn\u2019t really work very well,\u201d Wouter says. Under the Excel-based model, employees had to rely on the IT department, which managed the database and wrote queries to produce business reports. The process was slow, inflexible, and hard to maintain. Then Datatonic, a UK-based data architecture firm, recommended Tableau, which connects natively to BigQuery. Together, the pair addresses the full spectrum Vente-Exclusive\u2019s big data needs. Google Cloud Platform stores and processes the data, and Tableau visualizes and shares the data for SQL-free analysis. \u201cWith just a few simple clicks, you can create compelling visualizations with analysis in no time,\u201d says Wouter. These days, Vente-Exclusive\u2019s business analysts create dashboards using Tableau Desktop and share them via Tableau Server, which also connects to BigQuery to automatically refreshes data. The new workflow has eliminated \u201call the numbing work\u201d of the old model, says Wouter. It has also empowered business users to make data-driven decisions. \u201cEvery employee should have the possibility of checking their own performance or the performance of their project. This is something that we truly believe in, and what we are trying to achieve,\u201d Wouter says. There is a resounding theme to Vente-Exclusive\u2019s story, says Karol Ussher, Google\u2019s EMEA technology partner manager: finding ways to \u201charness the complex to make it simple and easy to use.\u201d This idea underpins both Cloud Platform and Tableau, says Karol. \u201cIn the case of Tableau, the user no longer needs to be a SQL expert or a business intelligence expert in order to create dashboards and interrogate the data,\u201d says Karl. \u201cAnd in terms of Google Cloud Platform, we\u2019re taking huge complexity around managing massive amounts of data and making it very easy and simple to leverage.\u201d Tableau Server, Tableau Cloud, and Tableau Desktop all connect natively to BigQuery.

        "company": "MainPower",
        "content": "While MainPower brought power to the people, its data analysis needed an extra spark. Data was siloed and team members spent time determining the true numbers rather than making decisions. Identifying that its previous data analysis system was time-consuming, slow, and cumbersome, MainPower turned to Tableau for a centralised solution to increase business efficiency and clarity of information. Today with Tableau MainPower has: For nearly 100 years, MainPower has been distributing electricity to homes and businesses across the North Canterbury region in New Zealand. It distributes electricity to over 37,000 customers via 4,873 kilometres of overhead lines and underground cables across an area of almost 12,000 square kilometers. The company continually strives to provide a safe, secure and reliable service, recognised by its community as a leading regional electricity distribution company. One of 29 electricity distribution companies in New Zealand, MainPower is a community-owned company that owns and manages a regional and urban electricity distribution network. The company is also responsible for overseeing, on behalf of electricity retailers, the supply of electricity for customers. MainPower ensures the safety, reliability and security of these networks. Sustainability-savvy, MainPower constantly seeks opportunities to take advantage of renewable resources. The organisation focuses on expanding and upgrading its distribution network to keep up with the demand for electricity supply while preserving the existing network. \u201cWe\u2019re relatively small but like to think we\u2019re powerful,\u201d says Sean Fahey, MainPower Database Administrator (DBA). \u201cWe\u2019ve got around 180 employees including the field staff out on the road servicing the poles and wires.\u201d To maintain its standards for excellence in customer service, MainPower analyses a wide scope of data from varying sources. Most information is sourced through a GIS system to map all assets with coordinates. The organisation also employs Tech One, an ERP system. The electricity provider began to see limitations in the way it collected, viewed and understood data, as monitoring extensive data sets manually can be cumbersome and time-consuming. \u201cWe were using numerous huge spreadsheets on seemingly endless sheets of paper in tiny font. You can imagine exactly why that was an issue,\u201d says Fahey with a laugh. \u201cExporting and analysing spreadsheets was slow and tedious with the methodology offering little flexibility.\u201d Fahey reports each unique data set could include up to 40 attributes. The type of information collected is crucial to operations. MainPower collected data spanning from maintenance history and reports to power ratings, outages and voltages, and customer records. Even New Zealand\u2019s flora and fauna have their place in MainPower\u2019s knowledge banks\u2014trees are often responsible for power outages, falling on lines during storms or strong winds. \u201cWe were experiencing an influx of data from each source. Our analysis method simply couldn\u2019t keep up,\u201d says Fahey. MainPower\u2019s data was often siloed\u2014it didn\u2019t have the chance to \u2018speak\u2019 to other sets. \u201cThe information we were gathering tended to be quite scattered,\u201d says Stuart Wilson, MainPower\u2019s Network Manager of Development. \u201cWe wanted to reduce conflicts within the organisation because at that stage we had everyone looking at data sets from different perspectives; there was no unity of information, methodology or centralised depository.\u201d \u201cWe also feared that important connections between sets were being overlooked. We simply had no way of compiling and easily viewing data sets collected across different departments and maintenance history.\u201d Double-handling specific sets of data also hindered business efficiency and diluted employees\u2019 capacity to concentrate on other tasks, with several sets of eyes viewing the same spreadsheets but interpreting them to suit individual needs. While spreadsheets certainly capture a wealth of information, MainPower soon learned they are less than optimal for presenting and understanding trends and patterns. The system was leaving information static and siloed while data analysis was slow and impacted business efficiency. MainPower started to build a data warehouse to make the data held in multiple systems centralised, useful and accessible. \u201cWe attended a series of seminars held by independent consultancy Montage to look into business intelligence solutions,\u201d explains Fahey. \u201cAt one of these events Montage presented six BI solutions and the standout was certainly Tableau.\u201d \u201cWe entered into discussions with Montage that very night, keen to learn whether Tableau could improve our operations.\u201d In further meetings, the Montage team explained that Tableau was renowned for its visualisations and analytics offerings, mentioning the software would allow MainPower employees to compile and share data visualisations and dashboards in an easy-to-understand environment. \u201cTableau seemed to tick all the boxes and we were optimistic it could assist with some of the challenges we had been facing. We were excited to give it a go,\u201d says Fahey. Progressing with Tableau Desktop, Montage worked with MainPower to create a pilot program in order to ensure the solution was able to meet the company\u2019s needs. This was then complemented by a further targeted statement of work, using best-of-breed solutions (which could be built on later), to present to MainPower\u2019s executives. \u201cThe use of MainPower\u2019s real-time data in that initial presentation opened our eyes to the true power of the software,\u201d says Fahey. After successful trials, Tableau indeed proved to be the optimum solution for MainPower. Over the next few weeks, Montage worked closely with internal teams to integrate the software into the organisation\u2019s pre-existing environment. The setup and installation process was streamlined and easy, with a representative from Montage available every step of the journey. \u201cChip Felton from Montage has been great. The deployment was easy and he comes in a few days a month to answer our questions and ensure everything is running smoothly. He\u2019s available for support when we\u2019re trying to get our head around new aspects of the software,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cAlthough we haven\u2019t had to call upon it yet, it\u2019s also nice to know we can contact Tableau\u2019s internal support team at any time.\u201d Once the initial process of connecting existing data collection points to flow through Tableau was complete, staff showed enthusiasm for sinking their teeth into the program. \u201cWe found that no matter what the department, our employees are able to pick up Tableau quickly and effectively, with a little assistance from Montage. We now have four or five staff regularly using the software.\u201d After the first 12 months of MainPower\u2019s journey with Tableau, the company can see the value of a cohesive solution. Improved speed-to-insight is one significant benefit. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to cut down on the hours spent analysing data; our employees are no longer doubling up to look at the same information because it\u2019s centralised.\u201d Compiling exhaustive quantities of data has also become more efficient. \u201cThe input doesn\u2019t seem so much like an avalanche anymore. It\u2019s certainly a refreshing change that several sets of eyes can easily explore data sets that relate to them,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cPreviously, I might have been the only one looking at a data set, because I put it together and was probably better equipped to understand it. Now we have four or five other team members who can get more involved and view and understand information that relates to them,\u201d Wilson says. Also, now that data sets from different teams can be blended in a single view, employees have developed a new perspective on their data. \u201cWe\u2019ve uncovered some unexpected insights through the new software, simply because now we\u2019re able to join data from different sources, linking it together to ask questions we weren\u2019t previously able to,\u201d says Fahey. These new connections especially highlight where data collection is lacking or of poor quality. Another key observation has been mapping maintenance issues. Information can now be displayed on a geographical map, allowing MainPower to reorganise and optimise its maintenance schedules for improved physical infrastructure. \u201cThrough this, we were able to see problem areas on a map and prioritise which jobs need to be attended first,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cIt also meant we could group work in one particular area to make sure it all happens in the same work package in the same year. This saw us save time and money as well being much more efficient.\u201d Finally, Fahey applauds the user experience and ease of implementation Tableau has provided. \u201cOne thing that stands out for me is Tableau\u2019s not an engineering tool, it\u2019s not a financial tool and it\u2019s not even an IT tool.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something that is easily understood, everyone can implement it in their work. Rather than buying separate tools we\u2019re able to use software that works for all employees within the company. Tableau has been more helpful than we could have imagined.\u201d"

The manufacturer produces canned fruit and vegetable products for many well-known brands, including Popeye\u2122 and Freshlike\u2122. Before Tableau: Now with Tableau and Alteryx Sager Creek was able to: Tableau: What goals have you achieved with Tableau? Matthew Hughes, Sr. Manager of Business Intelligence: We try to tell a story of many, many, many people's actions all at one time and identify where we could do better and where we're doing well. You just want to understand what behavior caused the result. And at the end of the day, what was the result? What was it yesterday compared to today? And what do we expect tomorrow? But at a transaction level, can I predict what that asset is going to do? Can I predict what that asset is going to do when I put this person on it? Can I predict what it will do when I put this person on it during this shift? Right there you're talking 20,000 lines of transactional data over just a couple days. And to do that for an entire plant where there are 300 people and 100 assets, three shifts\u2014it's amazing. It just gets me excited to think we can actually crunch that and answer that question. Tableau: How has Tableau inspired your team? Matthew: You connected two, you know, huge production environment systems in eight hours with a few thousand dollars and three people, and suddenly you've got stuff that they couldn't do for two years with an entire IT team. And that's what's inspiring about it. Tableau: What questions have you been able to answer with Tableau? Matthew: So much has to do with the volume of transactions. If you can record the abilities of your assets and say what happens historically when I change these things about these assets? Then you really empower them. But then you step back and you say, \"Now, what combination of that with the timing of our commodities coming in at the back of the plant, all these vegetables pouring off of trucks.\" You know, what happens when we start to put those together and say, \"Now, really, predictively, what can we do when the timing is this and our assets are running like this?\" And that's the stuff you can hand over to a plant manager or a C-level executive and say, \"You've got an immense amount of information control over the environment.\" Tableau: How did you integrate Tableau into the company? Matthew: We had to fight that battle for a long time. It wasn't until we demonstrated Tableau had full capability to go to the detail and all the way back up to the aggregate and planning processes for a billion-dollar company that they thought, \"Oh, okay, this is actually what we want\u2014this is how we want to tell our story, this is how we want to learn about our own company.\" Tableau is a hundred-percent scalable for anything you throw at it, right? Now, your visualization that told a great story tells it in a way that can change the way everybody does business. That company now has a competitive advantage You always feel like the hero. You know, \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d I just did this. It's not that hard; I'll train you. And you make friends that way, right? Tableau: How would you describe Tableau and Alteryx? Matthew Hughes, Sr. Manager of Business Intelligence: Tableau is the great communicator. Alteryx is what gets that communicator where it needs to be. Tableau: How do you use Tableau to make discoveries? Matthew: Production environment data requires complex blending and aggregation across so many different languages of data in a company. You can tell great stories in each vertical, in each area with Tableau, and we did that. But what it did was it showed us there's a great story to tell here, and here is the story in Tableau, but we see this great story, we don't know how they work together. What if we use Tableau to tweak this story? Tableau: How do Tableau and Alteryx work together to address your data challenges? Matthew: So you start to take these big chunks. And you've told these great stories. But now you've taken Alteryx and you've said, \"We're going to tell all those stories together at one time.\" And this is how you operate it. And Tableau can just so purely display it in a simple way. But not until, for us, until Alteryx took seven systems that don't communicate, that took data cubes with millions of rows and took all this and put it together and said, \"Now, go tell a story about all these different pieces.\" So I think that that powerfulness was, for us, was you know, we had Tableau and we had great stories. But we had so many of them. How do you tell it as one great story? And we did it with Alteryx. Tableau: That\u2019s great. Is Tableau having a personal impact on people? Matthew: Just a few weeks ago, the VP that we work for, she didn't have her Sunday mornings. She was spending four hours every Sunday morning normalizing Excel data in reports to answer questions she needs to answer. And so you can just step in and give some time back. But when you know you can do stuff so quickly and you can build this infrastructure around it that it almost manages itself. You just have to turn the little knobs. And you can give that to somebody else real quick and be, like, \"Hey, here's your mornings back.\" That feels really good. We're really going to change the way we look at our manufacturing processes. What we've really tried to do is just step in and say, okay, we can give you all that, just we need to build this culture of capture, blend it, compress it, and tell the story."

Fuji: A large amount of the data I use is sales data, financial data or survey data such as brand tracking data. Before using Tableau, there was a lot of advance work that went into data analysis, such as collecting the data, processing, aggregating, and tabulating it, and putting it into diagrams. It took so long to do all of that work that there wasn't much time left for the fundamental purpose of the analysis, such as picking out the issues, understanding the current situation and extracting solutions. Since using Tableau the time I spend on those things has been significantly reduced, and I can use that time for the fundamental purpose of the analysis: understanding the current situation, picking out the issues, and finding solutions. Tableau: How would you sum up the effect of Tableau on truestar? Fuji: Using Tableau has been a catalyst for our business and myself to make a great leap forward. The quality, quantity and speed of the incoming information is a world away to what it used to be. Tableau: What do customers think about Tableau? Fuji: Indeed, the most common reaction we get from customers is that it is easy to use. Another factor is that with tools we've used in the past it would cost extra money and time when we wanted to change things. Now we can make changes easily on the spot, and people tell us that the tool is useful for ensuring more consistent progress."

And what led you to Tableau?\nRob Parvin, Manager of Visualization and Analytics: Pulse Mining Systems is an ERP provider for the mining industry. The ERP back-end database is a relatively old technology. One of the challenges that we've got is how can we better provide visualizations for existing clients. It was an issue, and it's something that we needed to rectify in order for us to be able to kind of grow the business, and that's been my job. So that's where we've used Tableau. Tableau: What kinds of data do you have?\nRob: There's a lot of data that exists in, for example, the finance area, and also the production area. So we were able to take all of that information and provide visualizations using Tableau. Tableau: And how has Tableau made a difference?\nRob: So, for example, in the mine management area a lot of the different sites will have different data structures to represent, for example, water quality analysis. So we've used Tableau as a way of being able to provide the CIO with a quick win, allowing the delivery of a single reporting solution for water quality across the organization. That's then enabled us to provide the CIO with the capability to drive further initiatives and obviously get the funding to do that as well. So the impact for us specifically at Pulse Mining has been very wide and a success. We've been able to set a precedent and create effectively a new line of business for the organization. Tableau: How long have you been using Tableau?\nRob: So we've only been doing this piece of work for our existing client for six months. So it\u2019s been a massive win really all around for our client and for us. Tableau: How many people are using Tableau?\nRob: We went from zero licenses through to approximately 15 in the organization now, but that's by virtue of the first release and the first iteration of the rollout that includes Tableau as a visualization tool. Tableau: What does Tableau allow you to do that you couldn\u2019t do otherwise?\nRob: The capability for us to be able to have conversations around delivering analytical solutions for clients quickly, and obviously having a reference that we can refer to for that as well, is paramount, and we're very pleased with where we've been able to get to in a short space of time. Tableau: Where would you be without Tableau?\nRob: I think if we were presented with the same problem with a traditional BI architecture, for example, and an established, long in the market BI tool, I wouldn't have been able to have conversations with the CIO, my main stakeholder, around two week cycles, two week sprint cycles. We can only do that because of the speed at which you can create these solutions using Tableau."

They want to get the data quickly. They don't want any stale data at all. They want to get the real-time data, how do we get into that level? Tableau: How does Tableau fit in?\nVenkatesh: The business people, they love visualization. They want to build something quickly which can make them happy. Rather than you try to build something which takes like months together, then you release that to the business. Rather than that, look at something which can make the impact immediately. That's where Tableau comes into the picture. And that's where it is making huge impact. Tableau: How extensively do you use Tableau?\nVenkatesh: So in our company, we use Tableau enterprise wide. We have more than 20 teams adopting Tableau. They can do it on their own time, real time, and make it faster. So that it makes more impact rather than waiting for the process-oriented approach where you contact the IT team, try to develop this, you wait for three days, four days, those days are gone. Now Tableau is the answer where you just have them give the access, boom, they pull the data, they connect to any database, they connect to Excel, they build it within five, ten minutes. We have some of the dashboard which have been built in 30 minutes and an hour, and that\u2019s one of the top dashboards in our company, and people love it. And they say, okay, this tool is the best, why don't we evangelize across the company? Tableau: How does Tableau help you?\nVenkatesh: Some of the cool features within Tableau, it was showing like how the people are playing across the world. You know, how they're interacting within the game, how they're having difficulties going from one stage to another stage. Are they moving too fast in the game? We try to do all this cohort analysis to see how the group of gamers are playing against other groups and see what difference between these groups and how we can promote the product. So whenever we are going through Tableau is like using the mapping functionalities or using cohort analysis to understand a gamer's behavior within the game so that we can target the right people so that we can market them on campaigns in such a way that we can bring them back and play more and increase the monetization. That way, it makes more valuable to the company so the company can make better decisions. Tableau: Is Tableau catching on within the company?\nVenkatesh: It\u2019s growing day by day. It's actually taking over on top of other BI tools because it's building rapidly. There's no tool I see which can compare with Tableau. Tableau: How many people are using Tableau in your company?\nVenkatesh: Currently, it is running on 80 core machines. It runs more than 1,000 extracts on a daily basis. It extracts every 15, 30 minutes, one hour, goes to two hours maximum. So we have almost 1,000 extracts on a daily basis. And it's a pretty solid system. And I explored many BI and analytics tools like MSTR, SAS, BO, Cognos and SAP BW in my 13 year career. Once I understood the basic foundation, the purpose, the objectivity of this tool was very important. Tableau: How does Tableau help you better serve customers?\nVenkatesh: All these things are depending on the data. Right? If the people are complaining too much and the customer support team is getting too many calls, that's a bad thing, so we try to understand that data too. What kind of issue they're reporting to the customer, is that related to the game or how to play the game? Are they having issue going from one level to another level or the actual server is pretty slow and they're not able to see any particular image or anything within the game?"

By integrating Tableau into their product as an OEM partner, Homecare Homebase empowers over 6,000 customers with self-service analytics. We spoke with Homecare Homebase\u2019s Manager of Product Management, Andy Guarnera about how customers use Tableau to: Tableau: How long has Homecare Homebase been using Tableau? Andy Guarnera, Manager of Product Management: We've been an OEM partner with Tableau for four years. We needed something that was very simple and easy to deploy. Tableau: How many of your customers are using Tableau? Andy: Being a partner that extends Tableau out to our customers, we have over 6,000 users using the product, either through Tableau Server or Tableau Mobile. Tableau: And how does that work? Andy: We brand our BI offering as Knowledge Link, but our users do know that they're using Tableau and we actually see value in that. Our customers, knowing that as a leading BI analytics software, we want them to know that we're partnered with one of the leading softwares, and that we're offering them the best technology. Tableau: What kind of customers does Homecare Homebase serve? Andy: Homecare Homebase has a pretty wide variety of customers in terms of size. We have everything from a small single agency with 50 patients to large multistate agencies that operate many, many agencies\u2014up to hundreds of agencies. Tableau: Who develops dashboards for your customers? Andy: We have a small team internally that develops dashboards for our customers and also maintains the data warehouse and data sources so that we can keep it as simple as possible for our end customers. Tableau: How has Tableau changed the way that reports are generated? Andy: We're able to actually leverage the security that we have in our core application, which allows certain people to have access to only certain modules or certain branches\u2014operating branches. And so we actually extend that into our data warehouse so we're able to provide Tableau reports that can be filtered down to just single agencies, so that a branch manager is able to look at just their data. And those same reports are able to go all the way up to the CEO of the company and they're able to see the exact same information, but for across the entire organization. Tableau: What kind of metrics are your customers tracking? Andy: The home care and hospice industry is heavily regulated in the sense that the largest payer source is Medicare for the patients. So we've built a lot of things into our product to handle the regulatory side. In Knowledge Link, we've built in a lot of what we call key metrics that allow our customers to track the key drivers that directly influence the reimbursement that they get. So things like revenue per episode and visits per episode and average length of stay for the patients are some really critical metrics to track. Tableau: And has Tableau made that easier? Andy: So we've actually built that into our warehouse and also built some dashboards that span common metrics across all of our customers, and so that right out of the box, as soon as they turn on Knowledge Link and start using Homecare Homebase, they immediately will be able to track all those metrics. Tableau: Can you give me an example of how your customers use Tableau? Andy: One of the dashboards that we do provide for our Knowledge Link customers is the ability to project next year revenue, because Medicare is always coming out with new rules that affect reimbursement. They're able to take their current year revenue and actually project on top of that the rule changes that are going to be coming for the following year."

        "content": "Tableau: What does \u201cinstitutional research\u201d mean exactly?\nRobin Logan, Director of Institutional Research: Institutional research is one of those areas that's really kind of hard to explain. If you ever see an article that says the University of the Incarnate Word's graduation rate, you can think of me because that's what I do. But it's so much bigger than that, really, because we work with areas like the registrar, the admissions office as they're bringing in applicants and helping them in their process. From the point that the student applies, to the point where they're admitted and now enrolling for classes, to the student success area that then takes over at that point and helps them along with the colleges, the professors, the deans, and everybody that's in that group, helping them move toward graduation. It's kind of humbling knowing that we're part of the story of helping somebody do what they're passionate about. And because we can make reports systematic and have the reports automatically refresh and spit out on the server, people have that chance to go out and consume what they need, when they need\u2014and if we get it right, how they need. Tableau: So how is Tableau relevant to your day-to-day work?\nRobin: Tableau is, from an institutional research perspective, Tableau is the one tool that I have found to have saved my particular, I call it my \u201cIR life.\u201d Whenever there are particular meetings or last-minute reports, those ad-hoc requests, IR is one of those just real fast-moving kind of offices. And we have to be able to respond very quickly. Tableau: How did you handle data before Tableau?\nRobin: We just were working on our Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Hearing our Director of Assessment actually coming in and saying, \"I found what I needed on our server.\" It was just what I needed. Or, conversely, he would say, \u201cYou know, this particular report? It's almost there, can you just move these columns around and give me a different sort? And I think it'll be perfect.\u201d And it was, you know, it was ten, fifteen minutes worth of work. Of course, you know, it was all the work to get everything prepared, which just saves my IR life too many times to count. Tableau: It sounds like you get a lot of satisfaction in your job.\nRobin: To be able to provide information to folks when they need it, as they need it is, as an institutional research professional, is actually really very rewarding for us because it's one of those things where, me personally, I take my IR job almost to heart way too much because I know that they depend on what we do to make their programs better. Perhaps they're deciding not to do something anymore. Perhaps they're looking at what types of students to bring in or activities to actually start implementing. And were they successful? What tweaks do they need to make? And so, personally, being a part of that story is very, very rewarding for me. I feel like I'm making a difference just in the little bitty things that we put together in the reports. One of the most rewarding things is learning how we change processes to make it more efficient. I'm going to use our national survey of student engagement as an example. The first time that we built that, they brought us four books of data and said, \"Hey, can you help us get some meaning out of this?\" Tableau: How did you do that?\nRobin: We did a question-by-question analysis because they had a lot of questions and they wanted to split it. We weren't really sure exactly what we were going to glean from that first instance. Since then, fast forward, we have, through reshaping the data, learned that we can set a parameter and let them pick groups of questions, let them pick individual questions that's specific for their particular area. Tableau: Can you explain?\nRobin: So let's say the college of business likes questions one, two, seven, fourteen, and maybe the college of education likes these pieces, four, seven, eight, and thirteen. Whatever the case may be. They can do a custom list of questions that go along with what the university goals are. Just them being able to have that custom report helps them do their job a little bit better. Knowing that we made that transition from the question-by-question, first iteration out and adding to our skills, listening to what they needed, making the tweaks, learning how to do things with the data a lot better. We have given them a stronger report. And so, again, we're waiting for that conversation to say, \"Okay, here's the next step, this is the next thing that we need to go with that.\" Tableau: It sounds like you've really embraced all the things Tableau can help you with.\nRobin: I consider myself to be really lucky. My whole team, all of us actually work with Tableau. And I am the luckiest person because they're just wonderful people to work with. They have embraced trying to use the tool to help the community, and they see the value in it. Tableau: Can you give me an example of a Tableau success story?\nRobin: We worked with our office of student success, particularly our dean of student success to find that daily retention rate. Imagine that you have to report the first-time-in-college students to the federal government on retention rates on four-year, five-year, and six-year graduation rates. And so, naturally, she's going to be interested during that whole registration period how many people are returning in each of those groups and how they're progressing and what groups she actually needs to work with. We got wind, actually, that she was going out and trying to find those groups of students herself. And, you know, you want to save the dean time. It's the one thing that we can do where we feel like we make a definite impact. We put together a report that matches our daily enrollment file with our first-time retention file that we built, and set it up in such a way that she not only sees the retention rate, but she sees the student list, and she can filter down to a particular group to help her target certain areas that help her have communications. The first-year experience folks that they went out, they were using the report as well. And we'd be walking across campus and we'd see them and we'd get the thumbs up, you know, 'cause they were loving the report."

You don't need a PhD. It's easy to use. Everybody says that, but it's really true. You can download it and create your first dashboard after ten minutes. It's incredible. Tableau: What does Intellipharm do?\nYoann: It's a provider of report analysis in the pharmaceutical industry. So we answer business needs like retail or manufacturing and we provide data on demand. We have a lot of data. We extract data from over 4,000 pharmacies across Australia. So we need to consolidate, to take all this huge volume of data, and represent, display this data in a proper tool. Tableau: How did you end up with Tableau?\nYoann: So Tableau was the best tool\u2014agile BI platform. It was a collaborative platform. And we embed this tool in our business solution platform. So it allows us to develop, to catch an opportunity on the market, because before we used to create a new report, new data on-demand after two, three weeks. And now with Tableau and a new architecture, we can create a report in a few days. It can take two, three days to create a new dashboard, and it's really, really powerful. Tableau: What kinds of data are you using?\nYoann: We are using data blending from Tableau to link external data sources\u2014like an Excel file from a supplier\u2014to our retail data, in order to have more impact in the dashboards. For example, last week we created a new powerful report about dead stock in retail, and we created a new interactive dashboard for this industry. Tableau: And are you seeing time savings?\nYoann: Before, we used to create a new dashboard or a new report in two, three weeks. And now it's an average of two, three days to create a new dashboard. It's much quicker. Today we have around ten, twenty clients who are using this new platform based on Tableau software."

Tableau: What was your job like before Tableau?\nOgawa: While we used to use Excel to save and report on the data generated, we've changed this for Tableau, and now we are using it in a format we can view daily. Tableau: And how has Tableau changed things?\nOgawa: Basically, I feel that one hour has turned into five minutes. Where I think it really adds value is its ability to constantly visualize the situation, because what you want to know from routine minimum monitoring is actually limited. So, we're working to achieve that as a first step. Tableau: What would your job be like without Tableau?\nOgawa: If we were not using Tableau, we would check reports only once a week. Issues won't be detected nor solved quickly. So I think the value of this is that we are now able to solve problems faster. Tableau: Tell us more about BizReach\nOgawa: In the Service Planning Division we mainly think about how to make our services easier to use for jobseekers using the BizReach business job search site. It's basically an internet site, and so we think about what plans to adopt and what challenges are on the horizon, while looking at data and monitoring how users are operating the site and reacting to that on a day-to-day basis. While I think the essence of our department is making new plans and adding new value for users, I feel the ability to free up time is a bigger benefit than the direct impact on reporting work. Tableau: What are you using Tableau Desktop for?\nOgawa: So anything which is output as CSV by our report server is processed with Tableau Desktop and distributed by email to all members. Tableau: What were some of the pre-Tableau data challenges? Ogawa: In particular, writing SQLs to pull out data inevitably took a lot of time. but now we can get data just by making a simple small change, it's become the simplest thing. With SQL, we prepare data good enough to let things at least go smoothly. And then they are read with Tableau, you can visualize the data you want to see easily just by pivoting. I really believe we've entered a world in which you can complete things in minutes or seconds. In particular I think it's alleviated the load on people who are putting out reports. Tableau: How much of a difference does that time savings make?\nOgawa: I think it's really a waste to spend time on the routine reports, as I've explained. I think the most valuable thing is that the burden disappears and you have time to consider other more creative ideas and to go and interview the users themselves. Tableau: Tell us more about your data sources and storage.\nOgawa: We use AWS as our database, so it connects to AWS. What we're working on right at the moment is a format called data mart, as well as launching a Redshift server on AWS. We're currently looking at connectivity with Redshift. Tableau: How did you first hear about Tableau?\nOgawa: Before joining the company, I was wondering how I would conduct monitoring because it was a venture company. I wouldn't have the manpower. When I asked about this I was told there were good BI tools, and I was introduced to Tableau, so I first heard about it through conversation. Tableau: How important is easy, frequent access to data to data analysis?\nOgawa: When reporting, it's inevitable that you'll need someone's help, and even if they keep on top of the task, in practice this is likely to be once a week or once every two or three days, which is of course a little too infrequent. If it's viewed every day or when necessary, you can confirm the changes that have occurred, and see on a daily basis what services that site offers. I think it's really important to be able to see those in a matter of seconds, and I've set realizing this as a tentative goal."

Junichi Katori, Director, Buying & Merchandising: Personally, my biggest job as a director is making judgments based on facts and hypotheses, rather than analysis. The greatest benefit I've had from the introduction of Tableau has arisen from its ability to free up time for thinking by reducing time spent on analysis. I'm repeating myself a little here, but when it comes to reporting, being able to use a unified format for all the data that has so far been processed by staff members has given us significant time savings of about 20 to 30%. Tableau: What do you use Tableau for specifically? Katori: Principally we use Tableau for three things: analysis, management, and reporting. When I say analysis I mean looking into sales, goods, and customers. Management of course means management of sales, but also management of business linked to Salesforce. In terms of reporting, our company has partnerships with 3,000 brands and we use it to report to them. Tableau: What types of data sources are you using? Katori: The key elements of connectivity are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Google Analytics and Salesforce. We run around 300 events per month using Google Analytics data, which allows us to capture the number of page views or number of visitors for each. Tableau: What was your job like before Tableau? Katori: Before Tableau we would send a query to the database\u2014such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, Google Analytics\u2014then take all the data and process it with Excel (to carry out analysis). The problem is that Excel itself can't handle that much data. All those barriers have gone now, and we are able to process data in a one-stop manner. The preparation time for analysis has been drastically reduced. Tableau: What have you found to be the biggest advantage of using Tableau? Katori: Along with that, the big thing we can do with Tableau is view, share and evaluate the same data as a group by creating standardized reports. I think that's the biggest point. It allows you to overcome the barriers to data access and ensures data analysis is always on hand. The whole team is familiar with this data, and so it is really useful. I emphasized visualization earlier; our clients are essentially from the fashion and cosmetics industries and the visual aspect is very important for them. This part is very popular with them. Tableau: What else can you tell us about GLADD? Katori: Our company handles simple, invitation-only sales online. I run the buying and MD teams. There are around 25 people in the teams overall and we hold about 300 brand events a month, for which I source and select the products."

Tableau: What data challenges did you have before adopting Tableau? Akaike: With our previous system, it was difficult to manage our enormous data. By accessing it with Tableau, the efficiency of data analysis has been improved. We can now make decisions with right data. By introducing Tableau, we have realized big data analysis and integration of multiple data items. This enabled highly advanced analysis of the data that we could not leverage before, and brought us significant discoveries. Also, we can now visualize problems quantitatively to clarify which actions bring improvements, and prioritize them to effectively utilize our limited resources. There were limits in how we show our data with our previous system. With Tableau, we can visualize data variously with different shape and colors enabling viewers to understand them easily. I feel it is one of the biggest benefits of using Tableau. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted you personally? Akaike: Using Tableau in my own work has meant I've gained the capability to analyze and leverage data to bring specific actions such as planning strategies. I think this is a big benefit for our company. Tableau: What does the future look like now that you have Tableau?

What we thought we were going to find was that maybe there's two or three standards that had a greater impact. And we thought there'd be several others, the outliers, that may not really have great of an impact. It was clear as day that there was one that stood out above all others. One standard that has a 90 percent (likelihood to) actually project how you're going to do on the test. So if students, they can pass every other standard but if they don't have a core foundation and understanding of this one standard, they're not going to pass the test. Tableau: Has that changed the way teachers educate students?\nDan: So what that has really allowed our English teachers now to do is step back and as they're covering all these other standards, they know they always have to go back and reiterate all the core foundation of that one standard that has the biggest impact. So that's a good example of how we've taken something\u2014such as state assessments\u2014that teachers tend to be more reluctant about, spin it and actually help them and actually further drive performance. They feel like they're not only a part of the process because we give good positive feedback about them, including discussions, but also allow them to feel like we are here to help them and help them ultimately do their job better\u2014which is the end goal of what we're trying to accomplish. Tableau: Did you find any surprises when you started looking into the data?\nDan: So whenever we do any kind of analysis, we always try to let the data take us wherever it may lead. We may spend 30 hours of that week going down several different paths that ultimately don't pan out, but when we find that path that does, now it's a much more informed path, and now we have a much greater idea of what we're dealing with and we know how to tackle and address that issue accordingly. So Tableau has really helped us come a long way as far as breaking down those barriers, as well as making data easy for the end user and ultimately driving performance. Tableau: How are you sharing your data with stakeholders?\nDan: We decided to use Tableau Server, and we really wanted to focus on the end user. We didn't want to be bogged down with people having to use VPN to connect. We wanted something that was accessible wherever they were. That meant if you're at work at your desk\u2014that's great! We want you to have access. If you are out and about on a meeting and you want to use the iPad, you can use your iPad right then and there, pull up results. In fact, my boss does that all the time. You see him walk into a meeting, he always has his iPad with him. And inevitably, as they start their discussion, he'll start pulling up the numbers in Tableau as they go along and will actually base his questions and responses and everything based off the real-time data he's seeing. We always do this thing called a data review where we get everyone together from a school and we go through all their data. We're in this meeting and the next thing I look around as I had my boss at one end of the table that has the iPad out looking up things, someone else has their laptop out looking up things. The person next to me and I pull out our smartphones, are going through, flipping through the dashboards as we're talking about something. It was really interesting because it's a really good depiction of how accessible Tableau can be when you deploy it the correct way. Literally at that table we had all three ways, you know, laptop, tablets and smart phones all right there, everyone using it a different way, coming to the same conclusions and it really shaped the discussion we had.

Some of the San Francisco-founded firm's most innovative projects include China's Shanghai Tower, the Tower at PNC Plaza in Pittsburgh, PA, and the Los Angeles Football Club Stadium. Patrick Robey, finance manager, talks about using Tableau to allow the company to project performance. Tableau allows the firm to: Tableau: Can you tell us a little bit about Gensler?\nPatrick Robey, Finance Manager: Gensler is an architecture and design firm. We are professional services, so that's what we make our money on\u2014selling our time and our services to build people a better environment. Tableau: Did you have specific plan in mind when you adopted Tableau?\nPatrick: So there are some specific KPIs that we use, as many other professional service firms use, things that track the way people spend their time, the accounts receivable that we bill to our clients, the amount of backlog we have, how much money do we have under contract that we've not yet invoiced to our clients. We wanted to make sure that we were marrying past performance with projected performance in the future. I don't hear of other professional services firms really taking that forward-looking approach. And that's something that Tableau has really enabled us to do in a way that is empowering to the business. Tableau: Can you give me an example?\nPatrick: So an example might be, \u201cHey, I've got a renewal project that's performing poorly. Why is that? What sort of changes might we make to help that project deliver a better result for our client? How are we projecting that project to perform relative to what we initially thought it would?\u201d And so it just helps us deliver for our clients better. It helps us understand what we're doing in a more robust manner. And put resources where we know we need them. Tableau: Has Tableau had any affect on your business?\nPatrick: We're seeing it just change the way we do business. And I think that is something we rarely see with software. There's a lot of software that comes through our doors and that we'd attempt to use, but Tableau is something that is going to stick around, and it's changing the way we do business today. Tableau: What specific needs led you to Tableau?\nPatrick: The ability to digest information in a tabular format is just vastly different than what you get from something that is visually-oriented. The ability, I think, that has been really strong in the response from a lot of the leadership is that, \u201cI have a question, I need to get it answered, and how quickly that can be done?\u201d The information was always there, but they may have had to have gone to one, two different, three different places to actually tie this information together. And now it's all sitting there for a lot of our leadership just to go in and not just have to do the data mining, the visualization actually leads them to the answer. Tableau: What tool are you using most often?\nPatrick: The most popular viz at Gensler is an operations dashboard that allows us to take a look from a high-level view at five core metrics we focus on at Gensler, but then able to drill down. It's answering questions that people may have been able to find the answer to before, but now it's intuitive within the application and it's quick. So Tableau is providing the answers to questions that people may have had to hunt around for a long time and now can do literally in a few seconds. Tableau: What was the on-boarding process like? Was it difficult to get your staff to warm up to the software? Patrick: It's been surprisingly easy to get employees to understand Tableau. And the reason for that, I think, is because we've created visualizations that almost self-train and self-educate people around the metrics themselves. They've been built so that people can intuitively see a visualization, and it tells a story of what's actually happening. So there's this idea around educating people with our metrics, and without having to write up a long page or summary of what a metric is. The visualization actually tells the story. We have these graphically-oriented people that aren't necessarily financially-oriented. They now are beginning to understand the impact of their behavior upon our results Tableau: Do you have further plans for Tableau?\nPatrick: We recently went to a core license, so we're going to be expanding that to a large swath of different business unit owners. Over the next year we know Tableau is going to really skyrocket in its use in our firm, and hopefully provide that value for change of behavior and understanding the questions that people have around our clients and the services that we're providing. We've built some in-house applications to help us track projects, and over the next six months we plan to move that from these in-house built applications to within Tableau, because we think the front end of Tableau is that much easier to build off of. The enrichment and understanding and having one place to go, and people are already responding in such a positive manner to the front intake of information into their brain, that's not necessarily an architecture-specific item, but it's something for our business and for Gensler that is really important."

We spoke with Hans Lui, BANDAI NAMCO\u2019s Director of Applications & Operations about how the gaming company is using Tableau to help instill a more data-driven environment (video 1). In video 2, Hans discusses how Tableau Gold Partner, InterWorks, helped people get up-to-speed with Tableau faster. Tableau: Why did you decide to bring Tableau into BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment?\nHans Lui, Director, Applications & Operations: We're evangelizing the data-driven culture within the company so people can make decisions based on data instead of a gut feeling, right? I think that's something we're trying to promote within the company. People should start looking into data that we have obtained from our games, from our users, from social network, from all the transactions that we have on hand. Tableau: What sort of challenges have you had in the past and how is Tableau helping?\nHans: To be honest, we have more data than we can consume. So one thing we're trying to do is to educate our users to say, \"Hey, this is a great, easy-to-use tool for you to get access to this information without too much of a hassle.\" And we will try to help and build the dashboards for you guys at the beginning. But we'll empower you to do more and train you guys to do more on your own when you ask those business questions. Tableau: How does implementing this type of self-service approach to data help?\nHans: We have this theory about data ownership. A lot of time, the users maybe own the business process, but they don't quite own the data. All the data still resides in the IS and the IT department. What we're trying to do is make the business owner own the process and the data at the same time. So when they need the information, they don't have to come to us. There's no time lag in terms of getting their data analysis done. They can just go right on to the tools and allow them to get the info immediately. We're trying to educate our users: Don't rely on your IT too much, you know, to provide the report. You should be the one owning the information and analyze it. Because when you own it, you kind of have a sense of what this data is. You kind of \u2018feel\u2019 the data, right? That's one of the key elements why we picked Tableau in this case. So we're trying to liberate the data so that the users can use it on their own. Of course, we still provide the support if they don't see the data they need. Tableau: What benefit does that offer your IT team?\nHans: This way, my manpower can be more focused on providing the support rather than be the report creator within the company. But more like we call it 'data provider' in the company so that people can say, \"Hey, here's a Tableau tool, data's in there already, use it.\" Tableau: What made you decide to bring in InterWorks to help you introduce Tableau?\nHans: Our company is new to the business intelligence thing, so we tried to bring a little bit more hands-on experience to the users, and then bring a consultant to actually interview with them. We brought in a consultant from InterWorks to help us to do the basic framework. Tableau: What was the benefit of working with InterWorks?\nHans: It definitely saved us time with the help of a consultant. Right now, like, he is able to create dashboard for about three to four departments without much of a hassle in two weeks. We're able to get into some kinds of difficult business questions already for one department. And we're able to align something fairly complicated in terms of our game server data with our transactional data. So those are the things that we can correlate fairly easily using Tableau tools. So it helps us to basically bring someone on board and so kind of like throw them the data and say, \"Hey, give me some dashboard of this.\" So I think that's a key advantage of using InterWorks. Tableau: What is it like to work with InterWorks?\nHans: They're friendly. Very easy to work with. Very accessible. When I call them or e-mail them, they will get back to me within the day. When I have questions, they're very willing to help us."

In the following videos, Business Systems Analyst David Carnes and Business Process Solution Manager Brian Scott talk about how the city is using Tableau. In video 1 David explains how they are delighting managers at wastewater treatment plants with fast, easy insight into water quality data. In video 2 Brian talks about how his Tableau visualizations helped utility managers better understand sewer clearing teams\u2019 productivity\u2014and make decisions that improved productivity by up to 30%. Tableau: How do you work with Tableau and data? David Carnes, Business Systems Analyst: The people I interact with the most are the managers and the field personnel. They're the ones that really want the data, and I try to give to them in a timely manner. Tableau has enabled me to build a really good relationship with the wastewater treatment managers. Tableau: What did you first use Tableau for? David: The very first visualization I made for them was for total nitrogen. The old way they was to look at four different charts to get daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. I put it all in one, and I also gave them trend lines and some things like that, too. And when I saw the senior manager there one day in the parking lot, he came to me, he was like, oh, this is great, I can see all of my data on the same page! So, they're really excited about what they're doing, and what we're doing there. So it's really opened up a nice connection to those folks. Tableau: What are some other projects you\u2019ve done with Tableau? David: I'm very proud of many of the things I've done in Tableau. One of the most recent examples would be the dashboard I created for the phosphorous effluent that comes out of our wastewater treatment plant. We're regulated on phosphorous and total nitrogen, because those are fertilizers that can affect our aquifer and have a dramatic impact upon the Pristine Spring down in the neighboring county. So we really want to track that and keep it low. There's a need that came up and I got the request from the wastewater treatment plant manager in the afternoon, and by midmorning the next day I had a complete dashboard for him, and I had been able to explore the data and I understood what he wanted to see. I did version one and then they also mentioned they also were tracking weekly, monthly and yearly averages, and their limits are all lower than the daily (load ?). So I quickly hit a version two where I put sparklines across the bottom and just show here's where you are, so they could look at the daily and go, oh, we're in compliance and they could quickly see, oh wait, we're heading for noncompliance. So it was just a nice little quick turnaround. Prior to using Tableau, the phosphorous data was show in an older tool, and they had to click through a bunch of things to see it didn't show much. It was hard to really notice the change over time. So they were quite happy when I was able to show a lot of data all in one screen of all the different time intervals. Tableau: How has this change benefited you? David: One of the benefits of moving this into Tableau is the fact I can automate the updates that it tracks. Before, somebody would actually get a file that was spit out automatically by a proprietary system. They would open up Excel, munge the data, save it, import it into this other tool that would create the graphs for them, and then physically move the files up to a server so we could show it on our portal. Now it's just there. They just go do it. The managers meet on a regular basis, and they do talk amongst themselves, and it's really nice when my boss comes back to us and says, hey, Joe was talking about you guys and really getting some feedback that they're talking to him saying, hey, you know, you guys did something nice. He's doing it in front of all the managers, so they all know, and so they're all starting to go, hmm, what else can we do? So it's been very nice getting that recognition. Tableau: What\u2019s the focus of what you do? Brian Scott, Business Process Solution Manager: Our focus is for delivering excellent customer service and highest quality product to the customer. Tableau: How does data analysis help? Brian: People see value in looking at their data visually and being able to understand complicated relationships very quickly, and repeatedly come back to me for requests for more visualizations. So things that I never would have thought to try to look at for relationships I'm being asked from several different business units to generate more visualizations to speak to that. Tableau: What are some specific projects you\u2019ve used Tableau for? Brian: Speaking directly towards some utility cases, we use Tableau to measure workload efficiency at the time of sewer main cleanings. And in that situation the metric isn't how many work orders you completed but how many linear feet were actually cleaned. So we built a visualization that would allow the dispatchers to understand in real time how many linear feet their crews had cleaned on an individual basis over the past few days or even that day. And there was a nearly 30 percent increase in productivity amongst some groups when that functionality was exposed. It was a very iterative process, because I exposed a build of the visualization to them and they said, hey, you know, some of our guys were looking at this and they said, well, I only cleaned 2,000 linear feet yet, but I was working on Monroe Street that had a lot of traffic and one of my guys was flagging traffic all day. So what we wound up doing was going back into the application, giving people the ability to track whether or not they were working in heavy traffic condition or easement condition, and then mapping that back onto the visualization. So it was a very iterative process between myself, the dispatchers and the field workers to try to make sure that we're adequately capturing the work that was being done. Tableau: Who was involved in this project? Brian: There were about five or six crews that were involved in the sewer main cleaning process, and as a result of that I think we saw the total linear feet cleaned a year go up by about 50,000 feet. Tableau: And that is roughly a 30% productivity increase\u2014amazing. What was the result? Brian: So now, there were other things ongoing concurrently but one of the upshots is there have been a drastic reduction in sewer overflows in the city since we started tracking this data better and being more proactive at a preventative maintenance level. A lot of the times some of your best results come when you just are able to freeform play with things, and that was something that Tableau really made very easy to do. Tableau: What data sources are you using? David: My main data store tends to be Oracle databases. We've got some enterprise-wide systems for HR, customer information services and systems, and also our PeopleSoft financials data. I went and talked to them. I didn't say a thing about what I was trying to do. I just wanted to see what they wanted to get, and the priority in their data. And then I tried to understand their need more than just what they want. Tableau: And are you using live connections or extracts? And how do you decide which one to use? Brian: Our data source utilization is really dependent on the use case. So there are some situations where I have data that is updated maybe on a minutely basis, and I really need to use a live connection for that. If there are other instances where responsiveness of the visualization is more critical, I will run every two hours or every hour updates on data extracts."

It is also the world\u2019s third largest producer of carbon zinc batteries, selling more than a billion units a year. With Tableau, Eveready centralized reporting across departments, including sales, supply chain management, finance, and operations\u2014achieving 526% return on investment within six months of use. Championed by CIO Arup Choudhury, the company makes faster, more informed decisions on a daily basis with Tableau. Eveready had considerable amounts of data stored in disparate systems, including three terabytes of data stored in an Oracle database, supply chain management and Salesforce systems, and Excel spreadsheets. To drive more informed decision making, the company was keen to use its existing data to gain valuable insights. With this in mind, Eveready's IT team adopted Tableau to help the entire organization leverage data from its existing systems. Eveready's 52 salespeople use Tableau to track sales data such as planned versus actual sales, year over year (YoY) growth rates, sales trends, profitability of each line of business, geographical distribution of sales, etc. Additionally, the team leverages Tableau to discover trends related to customer buying patterns, cash-credit ratios, and more. After success in the sales department, Eveready rolled out Tableau to the supply chain team. With Tableau, the supply chain management team could get a real-time view into inventory trends, ensure adherence to stocking norms in storage areas, and track materials in transit. The team could also track distribution plans. For example, they could see and understand planned versus actual shipments. The company intends to leverage Tableau for operations and financial reporting. With Tableau, operations teams will have more insight into machine downtime data, production data, breakdown maintenance, etc. The finance team will also benefit from understanding trends in cash flows and product profitability. With Tableau, Eveready achieved faster decision making and increased collaboration. With Tableau Server, departments can share dashboards securely and the IT team can ensure timely, more accurate analyses across the whole company. \u201cIf you look at data in a tabular form, it\u2019s tough to understand it quickly, let alone get insights from the data. But using a visual tool, you can immediately see what action needs to be taken,\u201d said Mr. Arup Choudhury, CIO, Eveready Industries India Ltd. Eveready has already seen a considerable jump in sales with a return on investment of about 526 percent within the first six months of its initial Tableau implementation. \u201cTableau is highly recommended since it helps companies derive very helpful visual insights from existing data,\u201d said Mr. Choudhury. \u201cIf not for Tableau, we would\u2019ve been forced to stick with creating complex warehouses and churning data to produce reports and tabular spreadsheets. This would have hampered our ability to make quick decisions using real-time insights.\u201d"

In video 1, Dave Chan, Regional Director, Business Intelligence shares how Sales & Marketing are improving performance with data insight. In video 2, Dave talks about the high-level culture change UBM Asia is seeing after implementing Tableau. Before Tableau: Now with Tableau: Tableau: How are you using Tableau? Who is using it within UBM Asia? Dave Chan, Regional Director, Business Intelligence: Tableau is a tool to tell story of the data. Our use case for visual analysis is to provide a view of a marketing landscape, of a customer landscape that our marketers can understand where the customers are and the segmentation that they have possible for their campaigns. And that allows them to make use of the data more effectively as compared to always looking at the spreadsheets and keeping the leads in a list. There are two main user groups within the company. First are the sales team and secondly are the marketing team. They use it quite differently. For sales they use it as a reporting engine for the CRM system where we aggregate sales information, the pipeline information in Tableau, so the sales managers can keep track of the sales progress with a Tableau dashboard anywhere they go. For marketing Tableau is the core of the operation, because now every campaign selection has to go through the Tableau dashboard, whereas in the past it's been handed over to them from a dedicated database team. Tableau: How did this work before Tableau? What\u2019s the difference now? Dave: In the past that they had no visibility of data quality issues that they faced when they sent out campaigns, they only know that some campaign was not successful when some customer, we were not able to reach them properly. And now that they have the picture and they have the access, marketers can directly influence the quality of the database, and by doing so they're encouraged to segment more, to target more better and to also track their performance closer. And that allows our entire organization to be very focused on some of our major indicators of the business, for example, how many customers are we adding to the databases, are we on track with our sales target, are we improving the quality of our databases. If we didn't have Tableau we would continue to struggle with huge spreadsheets, and a lot of the insights that are hidden in the data would be lost forever. Tableau: Can you tell me a little more about what sort of data marketing is looking at in Tableau? Dave: For our marketing users the base questions that they will have on the data is how many customer are there in each segment, and in terms of demographics and in terms of the customer behavior. We run exhibitions, and so we have visitors going to each event, to each hall in each event, meeting different exhibitors. So there's dual location data, there are their demographic data, which company they work for, and there are also how many times they visit the event, are they loyal or are they new, which channel they come through as a customer. So all of that information can be potentially used for targeting. And therefore that dashboard that we built for marketers will allow them to answer questions along all of those perspectives, and in the end they will have a fine target list for their campaign executions. Tableau: How would you summarize what Tableau brings to your business? Dave: The main thing that we couldn't do without Tableau is we couldn't bring the data directly to our front line. There is just no way. There are tools out there who can help our marketers select data and help them look at the quality of the databases, but the interfaces are still very, uh, technical. So we might have some users who are technical enough to make use of it but across Asia the standards are not to that level. So we will have users who will say that they don't have time to learn the tool, um, or they would say that, uh, this is someone else job. But with Tableau that there's no excuses. The dashboards I just click and slide and click, so there's not too much technical knowledge that you need to have to operate Tableau Server, as you operate phone apps. So taking that excuse out and bringing the people and process alive then we're able to solve the problem of delivering data directly at the front lines. Tableau: At a high level, can you describe the benefit you\u2019re seeing from Tableau? Dave: So Tableau delivers two main benefits to our business. First of all, it's a change agent, so it facilitate a culture change. So in the past, we used to have a database team or IT functions who are dedicated to provide data to the business. So the business has very limited visibility to the database that they use to run their business. And with Tableau we allow them to have direct, easy access to their databases. And secondly is that it raises the standards of presentation of data within the company, that now they will be able to supplement their analysis with clear data so there's less confusion, and that our users are able to present with more clarity and able to be more convincing and they will be able to leave discussions with stronger conclusions because all of the conclusions are being backed by solid data that you can drill in and out, you can summarize in one way or the other. Tableau: That\u2019s great! And how does it feel to be involved in helping your company this way? Dave: I feel proud to be part of the journey, really to bring this fantastic tool to the company. It's been used in Asia initially, and now that it's also being used in other parts of our business, in Europe and the U.S., having seen many of the demos that we do, and having seen the impact that it has on the organization. Tableau: Finally, can you share how you got started with Tableau? Dave: We started bringing in a Tableau consultant from Singapore to train the team of 10 in the office onsite on our specific use case. The consultant actually built some dashboards specific to our use cases and even wrote a custom program to bring our unique data into Tableau. And that really set us in the right direction, and we are very grateful for having him there, because now that everything that we do are based on the original work that had been set and done for us that we can leverage on that experience. The professional services is part of the Tableau Server start package (Server Rapid Start) where we start implementing server. We wanted to get things right on hardware and software, and as well as the knowledge that are needed. And that's why we contracted the professional service to help us."

From its mobile analytics platform to its pay-per-call mobile advertising network, Marchex looks to data to drive better choices\u2014and better results. We visited Marchex\u2019s Seattle headquarters to speak with executives about why they use Tableau to save time, improve communication, and to simply see the data more clearly than before. Pete Christothoulou, CEO: We manage probably half a billion phone calls that come into our network every year. So there are a lot of consumer calls that we're seeing. That means a lot of different data points that are at our fingertips. And so we were super-excited when Tableau came to us and showed us the benefit of what they've built. Showed how it could help us improve our productivity. And a lot of times when salespeople are talking to you, it can sound too good to be true. And I could tell you, for once, it actually was better than we expected. John Busby, SVP, Marketing & Consumer Insights: To be honest, at first I was\u2014I was skeptical. And one thing that really changed my mind was the ability to collaborate across groups. One team can take what they've learned, teach how to interpret it to others, and then it spreads virally. With respect to my analyst group, we've definitely seen a return from Tableau above and beyond what we expected. If we didn't have Tableau, we'd be spending a lot more time stitching together data sets on an ad-hoc basis and not able to circulate and syndicate those across the company. Tableau has made it easier for my team to collect information, determine what's the most useful to analyze, and actually go analyze that data. So it's really improved the performance of my team greatly. Pete: I can actually see the data. We're really at this place where we can see the data and we can make better decisions. And those decisions are typically leading to improved client performance."

        "content": "HWC specializes in helping government agencies\u2014both local and federal\u2014through services that include organizational strategy, analytics, and program management. Senior Associate, Teri Caswell, and Associate Kyle Pipkins share how they improve processes with help from Tableau. After Tableau, HWC has been able to: Tableau: In what way is Tableau beneficial to government agencies? Kyle Pipkins, Associate: In my opinion, the public sector can benefit from using Tableau for things like exploratory data analysis because it speeds up the process to insight. And so if you can take what normally might be a five-day process and turn it into a one-hour process, I mean, there's a huge return there. And the investment is very minimal when you're talking about those types of changes and that reduction of time. Tableau: How are you using Tableau to improve understanding of data governance? Teri: Data governance is a hot topic in the government sector. There have been a lot of policy changes in the last few years, and some that are just occurring as we speak. The problem that it has caused is that people who make decisions in the government, the elected officials usually are not there to see the end result of their policy changes. And the people who drive the analysis to support the change usually are working on some fairly antiquated systems. So what we're able to do with Tableau, and one of the areas that I personally enjoy the most is to be able to gently illustrate to them what their data does not say. And we can drive some analysis in those areas as well. Teri: It's not just about the final number or the aggregates, it's the gaps of the data. And we can say this data needs to be sourced from this particular agency or this different specific capture moment. And if it's blank or it's improper, we can identify it very quickly, make the substantive changes, sometimes even a policy change, and improve that capture so that the analysis is available for progress and decision-making. Kyle: What we like about Tableau is it also helps us on the back end. So a lot of people don't focus on the back end of data collection and writing queries and establishing connections to databases and things like that. But there's a lot there on the back end that Tableau helps with that they don't see, so at Hassett Willis, we love it for all of it. And then our clients are really energetic about how quickly we can deliver solutions and then how fantastic and, you know, product ready they are once we get there and get there fast. Kyle: At Hassett Willis, we support the government - the federal sector. And my primary role is at FEMA and at DHS. So if I was asked by somebody in the government who's not using Tableau why they should use it, I would say, \"To save time.\" Primarily. Above anything else, it'll save time and it'll create a mature, data-driven culture. It's still considered an innovative solution in the government when you can bring in a tool that's very cost effective and actually speed up the delivery of products by the magnitude of 500 percent. Teri: The government is slow. But we are finding great success with some clients who understand that tools like Tableau allow us to tell a story that's never been told before. We can tell you where the data is and where it isn't. We can ask the \"what-if\" questions instead of waiting for regenerating reports that take days, weeks, and sometimes months. And by the time they land on someone's desk, either that person doesn't work there any longer, or it's been overcome by events that something else is of more importance. And we don't make progress that way. So it's a speed to insight that really holds true for us. At Hassett Willis, we call it \"clear insights\" because we are trying to find those compelling stories that drive positive change."

        "content": "Tableau: What's your mission at United Way?\nIndia Swearingen, Director of Evaluation and Insight: Each United Way operates slightly different from the other, but all of our missions are the same as we're trying to alleviate people out of poverty. United Way of the Bay Area specifically, our mission is to cut poverty in half in the Bay Area by 2020. Tableau: That's an ambitious goal. What sort of resources are you working with?\nIndia: We're working on limited funds. We're working on disparate data systems. We have a lot of challenges when it comes to data. It was really important to have to bring Tableau into our organization. Tableau: How so?\nIndia: It has saved us time in being able to create something a dashboard that can be consistently used throughout time. So now when I create a graph or our surveys that we do every single year, we already have a framework, we have the dashboard. I can just simply plug the data in there. Tableau: So you can use the same dashboards year after year?\nIndia: With our program dashboards, once we found the right format for it, once we found the right visual we wanted to use for it, now it's just a matter of connecting or uploading the data for the next fiscal year into that each time. So on the front end, you're putting in a little bit more time to get it going and to decide on the right visuals, but on the back end, it can save you a lot of time in the long run because it's a sustainable tool. It's something that people can continue to use each time, which saves a lot of time in the long run. Tableau: How did you manage data prior to installing Tableau?\nIndia: Pre-Tableau days, we still were a pretty data-driven organization in that people within the organization really cared about data and they really wanted to use it to inform decisions. What Tableau allowed us to do is get that information out quicker and faster to connect a lot of different data sources that we didn't have before. To be able to tie that together and actually tell a story is what Tableau allowed us to do. Tableau: Ultimately, why did you choose Tableau?\nIndia: As a non-profit, we chose to use Tableau Cloud for probably reasons that a lot of non-profits would be interested in that is that we are working on limited staff and limited resources. And so the ability to not have to host that on our own server has been great and has given us more power to be able to do these things without having to, you know, get more staff and use more staff time to host that server and to use more money. So just having it hosted somewhere else has really just given us a lot more time back, a lot more resources. Tableau: Where does your data come from?\nIndia: At United Way, we have so many different places where we get data, and just a wealth of information that we could be using to inform decision making. We have data from our programs. We have data from our collective impact movement amongst all these agencies. We have data on our engagements and how people are engaged with us, what they're getting involved with us on. Tableau: What happened when you started viewing your data through Tableau?\nIndia: One of the many things that's good about Tableau, about using Tableau, is sometimes you plop your data in there and you realize that some of this data is inconsistent with how it's been reported before. And so it has accidentally brought to light some of the data quality issues, which we were then able to have conversations about and improve the way we were either collecting data, the way that data was being entered, and just connect different data sources. So, for example, one of our programs hasn't been able to see its data year-to-date since the inception of the program. It was a pretty lengthy process to get all of their data that was coming from so many different sources into one place. It involved a lot of cleaning. But when we connected it to Tableau, we were able to show, \u201cHere's what your numbers look like. Does this look right? And if not, what's happening? Let's figure out where the rest of that data is, what cleaning we need to do, how we're talking about these outcomes, how we're talking about how we're measuring things.\u201d In every single project I have done across our organization, it's brought to light some issues behind the data. That took a little bit of time to work on that and get it cleaned and make sure that it was right for doing analysis. Tableau: Has Tableau made it easier for other people in the organization to access the reports you generate?\nIndia: The value that I get from being able to share information to an organization has been phenomenal. So now it's not some boring, wonky report that's sitting on someone's desk, but it's a tool that people can access on Tableau Public and just go to it whenever they want, wherever they have a computer. That's going to get a lot more usage for people is just giving them that data in a forum that's interactive and fun to play with. Tableau: Can you give me an example of Tableau in action?\nIndia: I'll pull from a specific example of a non-profit poll survey that we do every single year since 2005 to gauge how our non-profits are faring in the community, other non-profits in the Bay Area. Traditionally, we've done this survey and we've just done a report and kind of sent out that static report to the respondents or the people who we solicited. For the first time, we were able to do something that went live and went public using Tableau Story Points. We posted all the questions we would have normally put in a report with text around it to kind of help guide people through understanding it. But now people can really pull the data and use the filters and look at it by different slices of the data, if you will, and to be able to really just have that interactive with them."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Ashok Leyland is the second largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles in India, the 4th largest manufacturer of buses in the world, and the 16th largest manufacturer of trucks globally. Headquartered in Chennai, India, the company has a turnover in excess of US $ 2.3 billion (2012-13) and a footprint that extends across 50 countries, including several joint ventures with other leading global manufacturers such as Nissan Motor Company (Japan), John Deere (USA). The commercial vehicle business in India has become highly competitive over the years. While there were only two players in the market just a decade ago, today, there are ten players scrambling to get a foothold. In order to maintain\u2014or, better, improve\u2014its market position Ashok Leyland needed to continue to reduce costs and improve differentiation. The company is in the process of undergoing a full-blown digital transformation, with a vision to build an organization that makes decisions based on data-driven business intelligence and insights. \u201cBusiness Intelligence was a key aspect of building an information culture,\u201d said Venkatesh Natarajan, Vice President, Information Technology at Ashok Leyland. \u201cThe question for us was - how do we get people to use information for daily decision making?\u201d While Ashok Leyland was already using other BI tools for their reporting capabilities, these tools had limitations in terms of providing a dashboard facility that the business was looking for. Rather than a transactional, hygiene reporting tool, the company was keen to invest in a \u2018self-service\u2019 insights tool that would provide deep, specific insights that a user could slice and dice as required. \u201cWe knew that if we hoped to proliferate an information culture across the board and democratize information access, we needed an analysis and insights tool that has a self-service functionality, interactive features and is user friendly,\u201d said Mr. Venkatesh Natarajan. \u201cAlso, pictorial depiction always provides a much better 360 degree insight rather than a tabular format. So, the tool needed to enable that.\u201d Ashok Leyland launched its own extensive research to find the analytics tool that would meet its requirements and identified Tableau from the Gartner Magic quadrant. While the IT team was happy with the features that Tableau provided, it started off with a trial version to check the practical applications of the software. The team was particularly impressed with Tableau\u2019s columnar data engine, which drastically cuts down on time taken to mine data. \u201cUsing the trial version, we built dashboards and socialized them with senior management. The feedback was extremely positive. For us to be able to invest in the tool, getting buy-in from top management was crucial,\u201d said Mr. Venkatesh Natarajan. Once they saw the demo, management was convinced about the power and capability of the software, especially the depth, interactivity etc. Mr. Venkatesh Natarajan said, \u201cLike every responsible organization, each investment at Ashok Leyland is looked at through a microscope. So, every investment had to make absolute business sense, especially given the difficult market environment at the time. But the Tableau investment was done without a hitch because the management saw it as adding a new capability, a new strategic tool to help differentiate us from competition.\u201d Once the software was acquired, the IT team started looking for areas where the insights would be most useful. The idea was to create an \u2018information hungry\u2019 organization where decisions are based on solid data and reliable insights. Tableau is being used across departments such as sales, quality, service, operations and HR. \u201cWe looked at Tableau not as a reporting tool but rather as an insight tool. Basically, we want our employees to become data scientists who can visualize the kind of information they need and demand it from the organization. Stimulating a cultural transformation that encourages people to think deeper was a primary objective of the digital transformation,\u201d said Mr. Venkatesh Natarajan. While Tableau is accessible across levels at Ashok Leyland, it is well-leveraged by junior and middle management, who can then make strategic recommendations to senior management based on the insights they acquire. Today, Ashok Leyland is analyzing about 4 TB of data and approximately 5 million rows from SAP and CRM. Ashok Leyland is using data sources including Net Weaver Business Warehouse, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and external files to connect to Tableau. Ashok Leyland has also invested in the Tableau Server, for publishing interactive workbooks. Server allows Ashok Leyland to control access regionally, so users see only the information they are permitted. Using Server, the company is also able to ensure data security, which is extremely critical given the dire consequences of data leakages. The software enables customized views that can provide personalized insights to each division. \u201cWe measure the success of this software in terms of \u2018Eureka\u2019 moments that it brings,\u201d said Mr. Natarajan. \u201cAnd there have already been plenty of those with Tableau.\u201d For example, the head of Ashok Leyland\u2019s Quality was able get deeper insights on warranties and able to improve product quality. \u201cThe ease of use and the speed at which we can get phenomenal insights has had a definite impact on the organization,\u201d said Mr. Venkatesh Natarajan. \u201cBuilding dashboards\u2014an activity that earlier took up to ten days now gets done in half a day!\u201d Business units are able to set specific, yet aggressive targets for business, since they are confident about the insights that Tableau illuminates. Ashok Leyland is currently training more staff members to design and build analyses. A plan to build a data analytics team is also in the offing. \u201cTableau is a great way for the IT team to become popular within the organization simply because it helps so many teams do their work better,\u201d said Mr. Venkatesh Natarajan."

In video 1, Kris Munson, Director of Strategic Pricing talks about life prior to Tableau. At that time, his team was: The team implemented Tableau and brought in some help from Tableau partner, Slalom Consulting. Today, the team is: In video 2, Kris talks about deploying Tableau Server implementation went. The company needed to: After bringing in some help from Tableau Consulting\u2019s Server Rapid Start, Watts Water Technologies: Tableau: What would you say to someone considering Tableau? Kris Munson, director of strategic pricing: If a friend of mine was considering buying Tableau for their business, what would I say? I would say, \"Why are you waiting? Why haven't you done it?\" You're gonna ask yourself, \"How have I ever lived without this?\" Tableau: Tell me a little about Watts Water. Kris: Watts Water is a global manufacturer of water products. We're a $1.5-billion company. We have 40 locations approximately around the globe. We primarily go to market through authorized agents. So we have roughly 50 to 60 agents around the country who work on our behalf. And with those agents, we have territory pricing where we're able to respond to competitive situations. Tableau: How did you handle data before Tableau? Kris: We did some of it in Excel, and you end up just looking at rows and rows and columns of data, and you go blind and you can't really gather any insight from it. Tableau: And now? Kris: With Slalom's help, we were able to build a new dashboard that will dynamically calculate price realization across all of our markets and channels on the fly. And so you can no go in, change the timeframe or change the channel or change our source system and in a matter of 30 seconds, it's able to go through the 25 million transactions that we do a year and calculate our price realization for us. So it's been an absolutely huge time saver. And with that, we were able to take that report and deploy it on Tableau Mobile so that now my boss is able to run that report from his iPad when he's up at his cabin in Maine on the weekend. It's so dynamic that you can just change stuff on the fly that you find yourself asking questions and finding answers to stuff that you never even thought about. Tableau: What specific needs led you to Tableau? Kris: When we installed Server this year, we had a couple different needs for it. One of 'em was my need that I needed to be able to build some pricing reports and dashboards for myself and my team and my boss to be able to review. And then we had this other need for product management where they just wanted to be able to kind of do stuff with Desktop and publish some of their own reports, but we didn't really want any cross-contamination between the two. Tableau: Why not? Kris: The work that we do on price realization, they don't need to see it. I don't want them messing around with my data source. When we set up the server, we actually used Tableau Consulting to come in and help us do the server setup and the quick start. And part of that was setting up different sites on the server. So we have a pricing site and a marketing site, and they're separate, and we're able to use the Tableau Server Active Directory integration to, you know, automatically load people in and keep everyone where they should be, and it's worked out great. And he and my analysts were able to really work through it in a pretty quick time frame and it actually left us with enough time that he was able to do some hands-on training with our entire product management staff to show them a couple of best practices in Tableau, but then also how to use desktop to connect to server. We already had our data source published out there, and they were immediately able to start crafting reports. And they thought it was fantastic. Tableau: Have you been supported by management with regards to Tableau? Kris: Yeah, so my boss that I have, he is a former finance guy that is now in charge of product management, pricing, and a whole bunch of other things for the organization. And he has absolutely fallen in love with the product, the insights that we're able to gather coupled with the speed is just amazing. Tableau: What was the issue? Kris: We had a tough problem with a price realization report that I needed that I knew that we didn't have the knowledge to do in house yet. So we engaged with Slalom. We've had them in house working on some other software stuff, so we decided to give their Tableau practice a try. And the relationship has worked out great. We had one of their developers that was on site at my office for I think Jason was there eight weeks. Worked closely with myself and my senior analyst and my boss to get the report developed. And it's been great. Earlier this year we got ten licenses and bought Server and deployed Server so we could have a little bit of data governance. And we turned product management onto it. Tableau: Can you share another Tableau story? Kris: So last week before I came out here, I was talking to one of the product managers and she tells me, \"Chris, I came in at 8:15 this morning and had something that I needed to look up.\" And she goes, \"And so I fired up Tableau and I kind of know what I'm doing in there now.\" And she goes, \"And I started working on that, got that question, and that question led to another question, which led to something else.\" And she goes, \"And before I knew it, I looked up and it was noon and I had spent four hours working on there and it felt like ten minutes because the product is so much fun and so easy to use.\" Tableau: How else has Tableau changed your work? Kris: I come from a company that, you know, if you took Excel away from us, everything would grind to a halt. And now with this, I find myself using Excel, you know, less and less. It's just \u2014 there's so much power in this \u2014 in this software, it's so easy to see insights into your data that you otherwise couldn't."

        "content": "China has one the largest education system in the world. According to the China Education Center, almost 9.4 million students took the National Higher Education Entrance Examination in 2014. Compared to about 1.4 percent of China\u2019s college-age population receiving higher education in 1978, the country now has about 20 percent of this group of people in tertiary education institutions. Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) is a renowned research university in China that specializes in economics, finance and business studies. It has over 20,000 students attending its undergraduate, graduate and targeted research programs at any one time. Established in 1917, the university is now a multidimensional university best known for its applied economics and management studies, with economic theories as its basis. Specialty subjects taught at SUFE include science, social sciences, laws, philosophy and humanities. Student enrollment figures at SUFE have been rising over the years, and the university is increasingly dealing with more data. Operations have also become more complex. The school\u2019s Office of Data Engineering and Analytics now deals with more data than ever before. The team regularly uses Tableau to analyze data to gain insights into things like the number of academic theses generated at each of the colleges, as well as the composition of the students and teachers. Through the data, they also find out about student enrollment, student-teacher ratio, resource distribution, and employment trends. There are currently 20 people in the Office of Data Engineering and Analytics, and six of them use Tableau regularly. \u201cThe amount of data that we analyze is actually not massive, but they come from a wide range of sources involving many departments and various systems,\u201d clarified Gao Liang, a data engineer at SUFE. Gao and his team discovered Tableau in 2011 when they were looking for a data analytics and visualization tool that could assist them in quick and fuss-free data analysis. He added: \u201cWe found Tableau to be extremely easy to use, and it has very low barriers to adoption even for people with limited analytics knowledge. You don\u2019t have to be a data scientist to make the most out of what Tableau has to offer.\u201d Furthermore, Gao feels that Tableau has greatly enhanced the derivation and presentation of the diverse range of data that they commonly deal with. He said: \u201cWith its interactive features, Tableau also helps us analyze trends from a more macro point of view. This allows us to make big picture comparison and draw informed conclusions about trends. Compared to the past when we depended on Microsoft Excel almost exclusively, we can now have both a macro and detailed view of things within a shorter period of time.\u201d The team used to take one to two weeks to get results from their data before they could present to management at the university. This included cleaning up their data and performing analysis using spreadsheets. These days, time from data to insights is significantly reduced to just one or two days from having clean data sets to work with. Gao\u2019s team can now quantify and represent the various dimensions of analysis much more easily, presenting figures such as ratio of professor to students, students to courses in a more visually appealing manner. \u201cWe find the Tableau visualizations very attractive, and when we share these dashboards with the business development and management teams. We have also received positive feedback from our internal audience regarding the depth of our analysis and the striking visuals of our reports. Honestly, these reports do not take us very long to create these days,\u201d Gao commented. Gao Liang believes adoption of Tableau will spread further across the university. Over the last five years, he and his team have conducted five training sessions for university staff with each session attended by 30 to 50 people. These sessions are designed to introduce Tableau as an effective data analytics and visualization tool suitable for anyone. It is also Gao\u2019s intention to interest some of the head of departments across the university to deploy Tableau and use it for their daily tasks that involve data. Gao believes Tableau\u2019s ease of use and low barriers to adoption allows would be users to try it. He said: \u201cAnyone can and should start using Tableau to get a sense of how his organization or his team would benefit from it. He can explore before deciding on whether it is the right tool before deciding to deploy it on a larger scale across the organization.\u201d Gao concludes that Tableau has allowed him and his team to cut through the clutter of information available to them across the various channels in the university. \u201cTableau has liberated the data for us, and it allows us to conduct the complicated and multi-layered analysis in a shorter amount of time. The lively colors and visuals also make our audience \u2013 academics and management \u2013 more receptive to the findings,\u201d Gao opined."

Tableau: And how does Tableau fit into this?\nStephen: Where we're taking the Tableau platform, integrated within LeanKit, is really building out powerful tools that allow our customer organizations to unleash the value of the data that we're collecting through the everyday processes that we provide through our tooling. Having the ability through an OEM partnership to both embed and provide custom reporting for our customers is something that's been very exciting for them. Tableau: How so?\nStephen: Companies and customers are making very important business decisions that shape the way and the direction that their organization is going. If you're not confident in that data\u2014or if you're making those decisions on invalid data\u2014that actually could do more damage to you than actually not having that data in the first place. Tableau: Why did you decide to change from building your own analytics solution to buying Tableau?\nStephen: What Tableau does is allows us to quickly iterate, change, test, and experiment with different ways that we want to look at the data, different calculations that we want to perform on the data. And it's so easy with, you know, with very little investment that you have to roll back to do those experimentations and quickly come to the solution that you really want. Being able to do that rapid development allows us to do those experiments without repercussions of burning up all our development hours. We kind of all fell in love with Tableau from the get-go. We actually had originally built our own analytics package within our system. We were limited by the amount of development resources that we were able to devote to that. One of the things that we really like about Tableau is so much of that is already built into the tool and allows us to leverage that with zero development effort and just some experts that understand how to do that in Tableau. Tableau: What has the result been? What is the impact of making that switch?\nStephen: So, it's definitely been freeing, and it's allowed us to do more and better things on top of our data that we really would not have even tried\u2014because it would have been far too risky for us to do that or spend that development dollar. The most enjoyable piece of the relationship between LeanKit and Tableau has been the excitement that people get when we're able to take data that has been sort of loosely coupled and very hard to understand, and really turn it into a visualization that people can process and gain value from. Tableau: Can you tell us about the decision process?\nStephen: We needed a tool that provided a lot of flexibility because we serve so many different verticals\u2014everybody wants to look at their data in a little bit different fashion. And we were looking for a product that provided a maximum level of power and minimized our development effort. Basically, allow us to deliver more value to the customer. Tableau: What are you currently doing with Tableau? Stephen: We're currently in the process of integrating Tableau into LeanKit. It's been a very smooth process. We're supporting over 350,000 users. We're securing their data and only allowing, you know, customers to access the data that they have rights to access. So many of our customers are already Tableau customers. So it's a very good synergy between the two organizations and the partnership. It\u2019s very nice to see our customers, our large customers get very excited by the fact that we're actually moving to Tableau."

        "content": "Globe Life Park in Arlington is home for the Texas Rangers. It\u2019s also one of the largest baseball stadiums in the world, serving upwards of 49,000 fans at every game. While fans arrive enthused to watch grand displays of athleticism by their team, the unseen heroes work behind the scenes in ballpark operations. From Advertising, Marketing, and Information Technology, the Texas Rangers front-office team uses Tableau to create a 360-degree view of operations for 82 home games a year. By tracking real-time ticket purchases, food and beverage sales, and merchandise sales in Tableau, the team can collaborate quickly on daily business decisions that help prioritize resources, enhance savings, and hit a front-office home run. The Texas Rangers front-office team was eager to find a collaborative solution that would bring multiple spreadsheets and data sources together, from food to ticket to merchandise sales. \u201cEach department kind of made their own spreadsheets. So I would take some sales data and make my own version of what I thought I wanted to see,\u201d said Becky Kimbro, Vice President, Marketing. With all of this disparate data, making informative and impactful business decisions in real time, across the organization, was almost impossible. But Becky\u2019s colleagues, freshly empowered by Tableau\u2019s ability to bring multiple data sources together into one view, decided to create an internal \u201cAnalytics Task Force.\u201d Their first big project: tackle ticket sales. \"Hey, let's get ahold of this ticketing data, and let's present it in a manner that almost anyone can interact with,\u201d said Sarah Stone, Manager, Advertising & Marketing. The result is a multifaceted operations team with a holistic view of their ballpark and how it functions. Today, with a Tableau Desktop and Server solution, employees can access data and share dashboards across teams. Sarah shares how this creates a culture of collaboration: \u201cOne thing that's been successful in our organization is going to the box office or to ticket sales or to accounting and saying, \"Let's sit down with your data. We're all working for the same baseball team. We're all trying to sell tickets and help the team win. You can make a dashboard too.\" With Tableau, ballpark operations teams determined that 10 days leading up to the game, including game day, accounts for about 50% of all individual ticket sales. When games aren\u2019t selling well, the marketing team looks to dashboards to discover why they might be falling short of their goal. Sarah provides the example of a Father\u2019s Day game: \u201cOn this particular Father's Day, it was the last game of a really long home stand, which is traditionally a little bit harder to sell. It was kind of a special holiday, which can sometimes be difficult to sell.\u201d About a week before the game, the marketing team got together to strategize on how to sell more tickets. Sarah recalls, \u201cWe launched this particular ticket special four days before the game. And then we were able to see in real time what the performance of the special was.\u201d In Tableau, the team could see track the whole spectrum of marketing activities and how they were impacting sales\u2014from earned media to social media. \u201cThis has allowed us to put together kind of a template for launching these short term ticket specials. And that really is one of the more valuable things of all of our efforts.\u201d The team valued the impact on promotions and sales so much, they looked at other ways to leverage their ticketing data. They opened their ticketing data to other business groups from the box office to human resources. \u201cThanks to Tableau, we could present it in a manner that almost anyone can interact with,\u201d said Sarah. And it paid off. For instance, the team looked to Tableau to understand the effects of rain delays. They found that after rain delayed a game, ticketing data showed not a single ticket was sold for 15 minutes. The decision was made to shut down 75 percent of box-office windows, saving staffing costs for the day. The team can continue to monitor this data over time to understand trends and take action accordingly. \u201cWith our real-time analytics, we're able to do things like make staffing decisions on the fly,\u201d added Becky Kimbro, Vice President of Marketing. \u201cTableau has really helped us understand how to better use the resources that we have.\u201d In the world of baseball, promotions and giveaways are baked into the culture of the game experience. With Tableau, the Texas Rangers\u2019 marketing team looked at the history of attendance over the previous five years to understand how promotions\u2014like bobbleheads, t-shirts, or fireworks\u2014impacted ticket sales. When looking through the data from bobblehead nights, the team realized that attendance peaked on Tuesdays, not Fridays or weekends as they originally assumed. \u201cWe said, \"Oh, my gosh, these things are really moving this day of the week that people didn't normally buy,\"\u201d said Sarah. \u201cSo we then thought, let's try to put another bobblehead in the schedule at the end of the season.\u201d As a result, they added a Yu Darvish bobblehead night at the end of September, where they saw an incremental increase of ticket sales for the game. This was just the start of the team\u2019s data journey. \u201cTableau gives people the ability to actually know the exact numbers behind things. I know the number of people that are coming. I know the number of people that have bought a certain ticket special. I know the next day we have a cap giveaway, so more people might be buying for that game.\u201d"

        "content": "Stanley Healthcare uses sensor technology to help its healthcare customers track and manage important assets and to assure patient security and safety. In video 1, Lauran Hazan, Director of Software Product Management, talks about the decision to integrate Tableau Software into their offering and how they\u2019re finding the experience of partnering with Tableau. In video 2, Lauran shares an example of how a healthcare organization can improve the patient experience with insight from Tableau and Stanley Healthcare. Tableau: How would you describe your experience onboarding and working with Tableau? Lauren Hazan, Director of Software Product Management: Working with Tableau has been fantastic. Our partner manager, they listen to us. We have access to whatever experts we need at Tableau. And they've been very responsive and helpful. The community around Tableau, both from a technical perspective and a user perspective, it's such a strong and knowledgeable, and sharing type of a community. We've had a great time working with Tableau and gotten great support. And the thing that is so powerful about it is the fact that you don't have to be a scientist or programmer, or someone with highly specialized training that takes years in order to use this product. Tableau: How is Tableau used in your organization as a whole? Lauren: Our integration is at the Tableau Server level. So our developers\u2014and product people as well\u2014will use Tableau Desktop to create the vizzes themselves. But then how the integration works is our product fetches them from Server, and either shows them in our product, or actually we have some hospitals that are just looking at Tableau Server. Aside from the fact that it's a great product and it's been something that has really solved problems for us\u2026 We have all this great data and it's cheaper to collect it\u2014by orders of magnitude\u2014with our system than it is to do it manually or any other way. And so now having it be visualized is just so powerful for us. We've branded our analytics offering as Mobile View Analytics. But, everybody knows it's Tableau. We don't make any effort to hide that whatsoever. We're very proud of this partnership. Tableau: How did Tableau stack up compared to other solutions your organization was considering? Lauren: So of course we looked at other tools. Our culture in our R&D and in product organization is absolutely \u201cmeasure a few times and cut once.\u201d So we had a formal process where we evaluated\u2014I think we started off with six different products. Very, very quickly that went down to three and then there was sort of a final pilot where we evaluated on\u2026 I want to say 24 different criteria of all kinds of different things, performance, robustness of API, support capabilities, cost\u2014standard types of things. Tableau came out clearly ahead of the others. There wasn't a lot of debate about if it was the right one for us to go with. Tableau: What has the introduction of Tableau enabled your team to do through analytics? Lauren: Doctors and nurses by definition have to have a very good understanding of data analysis techniques and statistics and all that stuff, because that's their world that they work in. Primarily what we're using with Tableau is our RTLS platform. RTLS is real time location system in hospitals. So we have active RFID tags. I think one of the great things about being able to have the RTLS data combined with the visual capabilities of Tableau is that in clinical settings data resonates with people. They get it. This is what's actually happening and let's drill into it and look at it and see where the opportunities are for improvement. In my opinion right now the most exciting thing that we're doing with our Tableau integration\u2014think of a scenario where you're a patient in, say, an operating room or a clinic, and they put a tag on you. So we want to create a situation where we're using Tableau to leverage the data from your tag that's telling me, \u201cOkay, how long are you spending in the waiting room? How long are you in prep before the physician comes there? How long is a procedure taking?\u201d And then the hospital has this great visual patient experience where the can start saying, \u201cOkay, how much variability is there? Are our wait time targets in line with what we can achieve? Where might we have staffing issues in helping hospitals really create the kind of patient experience that they want to create?\u201d What we want to do then is create a visual patient experience. You're with a hospital and they're looking at their own data, it's really helping understand their problems. And it's less of us presenting to them, it's more the data presenting to them. Their goal is just to help patients get the treatment that they need and to help them have a great experience, or at least the least unpleasant experience possible as they're going through this treatment for whatever it is. And that's great. It's a privilege to work with these people, for sure. Tableau: That\u2019s amazing! When you think about the visualizations\u2014or vizzes\u2014that you have created for customers, what is your favorite? Lauren: So we have a viz that really shows graphically and visually each phase of care, and what happens and how long it takes. And so to me that is just such a powerful tool for a hospital to see. Okay, this is the situation; this is what it looks like. And when we intervene to impact any of these phases of care, you know, how effective we are. That's the one that I really get the most excited about."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: How does data analysis make a difference for students?\nDr. Robert Williams, Principal N.R. Burger Middle School: One of the key things as a middle school or being a middle school principal, you often have feeder schools that feed into your school. And at N.R. Burger Middle School, we have six elementary schools that feed into N.R. Burger Middle School. At the beginning of the school year, it is very rare that a principal would know or have knowledge of any of the new students. I had opportunity this year to encounter a student twice on the first two days of school. And both of their experiences tended to not be on the positive side. In the past, I would have gotten onto the child, question him, or would have proceeded to do some type of disciplinary action. Through use of Tableau, I was able to pull up the Tableau dashboard online and look at a student profile sheet. And from the student profile sheet, I was able to gather some information. That information did not match the behavior that I was observing from the student. I actually contacted the parent and she said, \"Well, Dr. Williams, the student this summer had someone put a gun up to his head. So he's been real disconnected.\" So immediately, I was able to connect this student with some services and now that student is our student of the month. We're able to get him connected to the classroom again. So Tableau was very pivotal in that information because it provided us with a data profile of the student and his previous five years in our school district\u2014and it gave me a lens into what I was observing and how it is not actually the student that he is. Tableau: How has data been handled in education in the past?\nRobert: Often in education, we keep student information in folders, notebooks, that are often located in your office. However, we do not operate schools from our offices. Learning takes place in the classrooms. Through the use of Tableau, we're able to bring multiple data sets and live data into the classroom from the administrator's standpoint of students. With Tableau, you're able to carry that information within a secure setting, which is located on the mobile device or the PC or the Mac. And it is user name and password protected. Once we're through with the information, you just simply log off. Tableau: Why is this important?\nRobert: The mission of N.R. Burger Middle School is to educate all students to become academically proficient and socially responsible. We're using Tableau to make sure that we are actually fulfilling our mission on the day-to-day basis, making sure we're checking and tracking academic proficiency and the responsibility by students as it relates to attendance as well as academics. Tableau: Does anyone use the data besides teachers?\nRobert: We do share the information I shared with our guidance department so that they can create and design and focus their work on meeting the needs of students. We share our attendance data, attendance trends, with our attendance clerk as well as our attendance officers to make sure that we are working with our students as it relates to attendance. But also we share the information with parents so that parents can have a linear message with their students and their child\u2014so that we can all come together and work and make sound decisions for students. Tableau: How do you feel overall about doing data analysis with Tableau?\nRobert: I am just very excited about the opportunities that Tableau brings not only our school, our school district, but also to our staff and our students. It enables us to make timely, effective decisions to truly move from notebooks and numbers to actual data and decisions. Tableau: What devices do you use to access Tableau?\nRobert: We use PC, Macs, and we are able to pull it up on my iPad. So those are three of the key devices that I use. The mobile apps were very interesting to me. Being able to manipulate the data sets from the mobile device and improving the user friendliness of the mobile applications. Oftentimes, if you're focusing on intensive work with multiple data sets, you tend to have a lot of paper, a lot of binders, a lot of notebooks that are just in the conference room that you have multiple eyes upon."

Tableau: And how does Tableau fit into that mission? James: Tableau has certainly been a key for us as -- we're looking at student data and being able to inform how we can best serve children. In all -- it helps us to identify fault lines and situations where we can address the particular needs of not only groups of children, but individual children. Tableau: What were things like before Tableau?\nJames: Far in the past before Tableau, we were not able to do that in an instantaneous way. It would take us sometimes 10 to 12 hours to be able to collect all the data sets and making informed decisions about children. Tableau: And now?\nJames: It works well with our student information system. We're using Tableau Cloud currently, and our partner that we work with does the back-end work for us. It all creates a profile of a student. And but prior to Tableau, actually, usage. We only had spreadsheets to look at. And then that's everything in isolation. But when we able to bring it all together as a student profile of all the data sets that we have on one individual student, it clearly paints a clear picture of what needs to be done, what has been done, and what you need to continue to do. Tableau: Does Tableau help you save time?\nJames: Time is very important. And many times in education, we think because we're busy we're doing something. And that's what we were doing in the past because we were busy, working with spreadsheets and looking in that isolation -- isolated numbers. But with the limited time that it takes to access Tableau, we're really able to do something from that. So we think the actionable time is really key for us. Tableau: Who is currently using Tableau?\nJames: Currently in our district, the district administrators and all school administrators have access. This year, our next steps this year would be to expand into teacher leaders, which will be far reaching into the schools at this point. In the future, we plan to expand it to all teachers. But we're excited about even expanding to teacher leaders this year. Tableau: What has the overall impact of Tableau been?\nJames: It's really helping us, we think, to be able to change lives because data means something. And once you ask the right questions around it and be very intentional in -- in seeking those questions, you can find answers. If you're not using Tableau, you're not doing data analytics around children. We have changed in many ways. As I said, our data pieces are actionable as real live, real time, we can now go back and reflect, as a lot of questions, find more information about students and totally provide a full service to students and families by enabling us to do that. We're always thinking of ways of how we can inform and input more data and make informed decisions. We're excited about the many workbooks that we have and things of that nature in Tableau."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: What have you learned since adopting Tableau?\nRandy Fagin, MD, VP Robotic Surgery: I think one of the most important things that we've learned in delivering care is that you would ask what do we measure, what can we measure that other folks aren't measuring? Exceptional care is not just about experience. There are operational things that we can do that we learn using things like Tableau, using this real time data, that lets us create exceptional care and scale that to a degree that we could never do if it was just based on experience alone. Telling somebody that they're not as good as this other hospital down the road is nowhere near as valuable as saying, if you want to be like that do these three things. And that's really what Tableau has allowed us to do. Tableau: What kinds of data do you have?\nRandy: Looking at 98 hospitals, looking at 30,000 procedures per year, what's the same by surgeon, by procedure, by nurse type, and how can we leverage that to deliver better care? There are core behaviors that, not just behaviors, but I would say there are core disciplines that people put in place in their lives that are just kind of how they exist that actually result in a whole bunch of downstream endpoints. And what we've been able to do with Tableau that I've never seen anybody do with any other mechanism is to find out what are those core disciplines, those core behaviors that don't drive one performance metric, they drive 30 performance metrics. The ability for us to interact with the data the way that we want it was completely transformational. To be able to dig down not to the level of what we're looking at, but kind of the things that are causing what we're looking at, that's unique. And that's not something that we were able to do before Tableau came along. Tableau: What was it like before Tableau?\nRandy: The difference between the way that we looked at the information before and now, if I look at my ability to do ask and answer questions and the distance between that ask and that answer, now versus before, just in the last three years of our using the product, yes, I've saved years of my life waiting for information. Tableau: What\u2019s one important factor in health care?\nRandy: One of the things that we look at are delays, delays at getting a patient to the operating room, whether it's a delay in an emergency room getting a patient from the front door to a doctor, whether it's a delay in the operating room getting a patient from the pre-op area into the operating room. Delays impact our ability to deliver exceptional care. And we all have hunches on what we think causes those delays. So when you start to hear a group of individuals all kind of pointing in the same direction saying, we believe that this is the reason why our customers have a delay between what they want and what they receive, we were able to actually dig in, in a very short period of time to figure out whether that was real and then be able to act on it. And I'll tell you the most interesting and important part of that was we didn't have to take any we didn't have to change a process. We didn't have to take any punitive action against anybody. All we had to do was to take the information we had learned on the cause of the delay, transparently, and just make that information available. I'll tell you, the ability to deliver real time transparent information to people is transformational. Behaviors change. They change just based on being able to see in real time what's going on. This is not last quarter's results. This is not last week's results. This is not even yesterday's. This is what's happening right now. Real time information, real time knowledge, creates real time accountability. And our ability to deliver quickly and rapidly change in an environment to make sure that our care is exceptional, man, real time accountability you can't beat that. Tableau: What\u2019s the biggest change for you personally since using Tableau?\nRandy: I think the biggest thing that Tableau offered was the ability for somebody like me, I'm a surgeon by training and I've kind of transitioned to the healthcare management field. I'm not a statistician. I've got no background in mathematics outside of what I did in college. And to be able to be the person with no intermediary between myself and understanding the data, that was critical. In all of the other data solutions that we looked at, I needed to request a data query. I needed to have somebody to review that for me, to create that chart, whatever it was, and interact with them in a way that allowed me to read it. It was too much delay between what I wanted and when I was able to get it. And Tableau shortened that gap to nothing. It allowed me to actually be able to in real time interact with the data and answer questions with nobody in-between me and the information. Tableau: What\u2019s the value of powerful data analysis to you?\nRandy: It's not anecdotal, because Tableau allows us to integrate so much information in real time, all at once, the anecdotal stuff washes out. If it's noise we're going to see as much above the line as we do below the line. The anecdotal stuff just washes away when the N is big enough. And what you see are real trends. And when you see a real trend you go, holy cow, that's amazing. Let me check this other one. Not next week, not in a report that somebody will pull for me, but right now, like sitting at this table. Let's figure this out while we're here talking. Tableau: Can you tell us more about the logistics of robotic surgery?\nRandy: So robotic surgery with da Vinci is the transformation in medicine and our ability to deliver exceptional care to patients in the operating room in surgery. And as robotic surgery, as da Vinci surgery has evolved, it is no longer just one machine for one type of operation. There are multiple different iterations of the machine. There are dozens if not hundreds of different operations that we can do with that. And as a result it means that we don't have a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to things like capacity or performance or being able to deliver exceptional and efficient care."

In this video, Head of Data Science David M\u00fcller talks about how much faster his developers can work with help from Tableau. Tableau: How would you describe Tableau to someone who wasn\u2019t familiar with our software?\nDavid M\u00fcller, Head of Data Science: I\u2019d describe Tableau to friends and work colleagues as a tool that just hugely facilitates the interactivity of data analysis and interpreting data. I\u2019d describe Tableau as a tool that just makes data analysis and simply dealing with data enormously simplified. Tableau: How were you building reports prior to finding Tableau? David: Previously, we had increasingly used Microsoft Excel, where the development time for an interactive product, even in the case of Microsoft Excel, is gigantic, because this interactivity is simply not there. And when compared in relative terms to Tableau, we could see that within a few days we achieved good results. In Tableau, we were simply able to drag and drop the data in; we took care of the data aggregation, but after the data aggregation we didn't incur any more development costs, we just had to maintain a report template and then we quickly got to the interesting reports. If I had to give a figure, then I\u2019d say that the pace of development has at least doubled for this kind of report. Tableau has had a great impact on our team Tableau: How is your team using Tableau?\nDavid: We\u2019re a technical team - all our employees have a strong focus on IT, and a lot of coding is done in-house. Our work is divided into two parts: 50 percent might be spent working directly on the code, and 50 percent is then done in Tableau. So for us, and above all for the members of our team, Tableau has become a part of everyday work. Tableau: Is speed the primary reason you\u2019re using Tableau more and more?\nDavid: The reason why we now increasingly use Tableau is ultimately that we have noticed that it is a good tool, especially with version 8.1, the most recent version fulfills our requirements to an even greater extent; also that it is increasingly in use by our customers within the online marketing sector. For example, we have a large agency and customers who place greater emphasis on Tableau, have their own Tableau Server and are naturally pleased when we also have Tableau products as this makes integration somewhat easier. Tableau: Finally, are your customers finding any surprises or unexpected results in the data you\u2019re showing them in Tableau?\nDavid: Just thinking about it now, about which \u2018Eureka\u2019 moments we had with customers, they have come from the offered interactivity alone. As soon as we go to the customer and directly say, \u201cI\u2019ve brought specific other factors to this use-case\u201d, for example gender or region, then these are things that I generally always want to look at to see where my measures were better, did they work for a specific gender? This is only partially offered in web front-ends, and partially not. But we can join precisely these demographic data, really well, and then integrate them with Tableau. With the customer, this then always results in \u2018Eureka\u2019 moments, because they\u2019re still not used to this kind of interactivity in data analyses."

To hear a real-life story about how Real World Retail is helping Irish retailer Pamela Scott improve merchandising decisions, watch John's second video. Tableau: How are visual analytics particularly useful in the retail industry?\nJohn Hogan, Founder and Chief Data Scientist: Retailers are very busy people. And so they need to know the answers pretty much straight away. And basically, the easiest way to do that\u2014or the most effective way to do that\u2014is by doing visuals first on Tableau. They can get a picture what's happening in about ten seconds; they can read the visual. And then from that, basically, they can get actions out of there that gives them the extra piece of information to make the decisions they need to make. Tableau: How is your company using Tableau?\nJohn: At Real World Retail, we have a decision support system built on Tableau. So we've designed a whole system based around how retailers make decisions. So when they have a decision to make, like for presenting them with a visual that's condensing a huge amount of information. And then, basically, from that visual they can see what's happening now. And then we give them a series of actions which is basically shows them just enough information to eliminate a weakness or to maximize an opportunity. Tableau: What sort of data are you looking at?\nJohn: Mostly we're looking at point-of-sale data. So we have, like, a large amount of data at our fingertips. And so we've got plenty of data to, like, discover and to visualize. And, like, One of the key things Tableau does is, like, it converts huge amounts of data into very simple visualizations and insights. You can start with what you think like you might see, and then basically when you do your data discovery, invariably, you'll find something else is going on. And so you get to see what is happening in the retailer's business like very easily in a way that wasn't like apparent before. Tableau: What has the impact been?\nJohn: What we find is a whole new world has opened up in terms of data discovery. And retailers that are using the old methods of fixed reports, basically, are poorly-armed with information compared to when we look at our customers now. They know everything about everything and they've got thinking time because they can consume their visuals in a fraction of the time... that basically another retailer is looking at reports. Tableau: What sort of retailers do you work with? And what sort of data are you analyzing for them?\nJohn: Our biggest customer is using about 20 million records like that we pull in every day. That takes about 20 minutes to pull in on Tableau and do all the calculations that we do on it. With Pamela Scott, they have changed their business of how they worked. They've moved from like from being like a high-end retailer to more of a mix of value-driven and high-end based on the data discovery that has been done through Tableau and Real World Retail. And from that, they are really improving their business by having shorter lead times and having more open to buy available so they can like react to customer trends rather than basically being like having the stock already pre bought six months ago. Tableau: Are you looking at data all from one source or do you blend data from multiple sources?\nJohn: We're connecting to lots of different data sources. Our primary data sources are like EPOS systems, so normally SQL Server or Access or a database like that. But then, frequently, we find that like a lot more information is held on spreadsheets or text files or whatever. So we pull that in as well and we blend it all together to produce the results that retailers need to see. Tableau is brilliant at data blending you can like connect to information in lots of different places and then basically you can just pull it all together and present it as one visual. Whereas previously, like, information was in different silos and basically you had to get your information like one report at a time from each silo. Tableau: Do you ever analyze customer sentiment data?\nJohn: On our pharmacy system, we do wisdom of the crowd. We listen to our customers on the questions that they're asking. And very often, a very innocent question can end up with a gold mine of an insight. So, for example, we had a question on, \u201cHow often are my patients coming in?\u201d From that, with data discovery, we found that basically that retailer was borrowing patients from somebody else. When real -- in reality, they -- what they should have been doing was, like, keeping their own patients. So now they've done a full change of business process to convert the patients that are currently slipping through their fingers. Tableau: That\u2019s great! Any last thoughts on Tableau?\nJohn: At Real World Retail, we use Tableau as our core product. And I don't think we would be able to do what we do without Tableau. It gives them all the information at their fingertips in a way that they couldn't see before."

        "content": "Tableau: Why do businesses seek out Google BigQuery?\nBrad Kilshaw, Cloud Platform Partner Manager, Google: So as we all know, there's a tectonic shift to the cloud. Many businesses are trying to move away from complex, on-premise, data warehouse solutions that are difficult to manage. We're seeing more and more enterprise customers embracing Google BigQuery. We see Tableau being one of the partners that will allow us to go and engage inside of enterprises. It will allow us to visualize data alongside BigQuery, and move into a business sometimes as a tactical way, initially, to move in, and then we can expand our footprint. Tableau: How does Tableau help you help your clients?\nVish Agashe, Global Product Lead for Big Data Technologies, Google: I can quantify the impact in terms of people putting more data into Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery. The reason they put more data is because they're able to get value out of that data using tools from Tableau. I see that more and more install base in terms of more data scientists, more analysts, kind of querying data out of Google Cloud Platform using Tableau. So if I were to put this in a nutshell, the right tool sets from Tableau, Google Cloud Platform helped our customer prospects realize value faster out of big data and actually realize the value. Tableau: What do clients get out of this partnership?\nBrad: I'd say the value for customers is really around reducing costs with joint solutions. And we believe that with Tableau and BigQuery, we can reduce costs for customers, we can increase their pace of analyzing data, and we can allow their business to scale quickly and easily. We can only do that with partners that add value to us. I see that as one key area. Vish: Customers are really happy because they can get up and running really fast with this integration. Given what Tableau 8.2 has done in terms of integration with BigQuery. It's pretty seamless. Single point and click, and they can start analyzing massive data sets. Tableau: So the partnership works well?\nBrad: We're looking for innovative, agile partners with solutions that are easy to use that integrate with Google. And, absolutely, we see that partnership with Tableau delivering on all of those fronts. It's a perfect complement, it's a perfect partnership for Tableau to visualize this phenomenal infrastructure that Google sits on with BigQuery. A perfect partnership that we work in synergy. Tableau: What kind of customer feedback do you get?\nVish: I have personally spent a lot of time in the BI industry and Tableau is doing some unique things. We hear constantly from customers that they're able to get up and running with Tableau and BigQuery within a matter of hours, and that's a big testimony to what Tableau does well. It is about using data to generate insights. Using data to drive your decision making rather than the other way around. Tableau: What\u2019s collaboration been like with Tableau?\nVish: The experience with Tableau has been fantastic. Every time we come to event, we are treated as a family. Experience with how fast some of the feature requests are -- some of the kind of fixing of the bugs has been amazing. How fast we have been able to get interactions with senior folks in product management and development to issues we report has been amazing. Brad: So for us to go into new business and engage with prospects, they're our number-one visualization partner. And also they allow us to engage with other technology partners as well such as DataSift, where we can take social feeds, ingest it into BigQuery, and allow people to go visualize social aspects about their marketplace and themselves. Tableau: Has Tableau been up the technology challenges?\nVish: Yes. If you consider BigQuery supports SQL interface RESTful APIs. And Tableau engineering team took advantage of that and integrated using our native APIs in 8.2 You know, it was relatively straightforward. Both engineering teams worked together. We already had the APIs out there. So it was relatively easy from the perspective of bringing those architectures together and integrating."

In this video, director of alliances and channels James Ritchie, senior director and head of alliances and channels Todd Lloyd, and Senior Architect Tim Shea discuss how Tableau allows them to visualize \u201cwhat types of insights are actually buried in\u201d the data. Tableau: What does DataSift do? Todd Lloyd, Senior Director: So DataSift, what we do is we provide rich social data access to a wide variety of social data sources, as well as do all the processing of that social data. So social data is often very hard for our customers to work with. It's big, it's unwieldy, it's unstructured, and DataSift will process it, enrich it and curate that information so that customers can consume it easily and bring it into their enterprise. Tableau has really helped us because we solve part of the equation for our customers. We provide this access and enrichments to this great social data, but they only have the data. They still need to do something with that data. So Tableau has brought the analytics side to the equation and helping our customers being able to get that data and extract insights from that data so they can really do something productive for their business. Tableau: What does Tableau allow you to do that you couldn\u2019t before? Tim Shea, Senior Architect: I think where Tableau really shines is allows you to bring your own questions and hypotheses into the equation. So if you have certain skills to bear, certain domain expertise, you can apply that in a data visualization context, and really begin to show off things that you know in a rich, you know, visual format. So working with Tableau has been great for me. I think the great thing about Tableau is it allows you to bring your own skills to bear. If you have a background in journalism or advertising or statistics, you can ask those types of questions in Tableau. So it allows many different types of people to interrogate the same dataset and come up with different types of questions and answers. Tableau: What particular problems has Tableau helped you solve? James Ritchie, Director: Some of the key business problems that I think the combination of DataSift and Tableau really helps people solve is that combining internal business data, the insight from internal business data, in combination with social data, so providing new customer insight, competitive insight, which could be used for product development, improving customer service, so a whole range of uses. Tableau: What was it like before Tableau? Todd: Before we used a variety of different tools in terms of how we looked at and analyzed data. I think some of it was -- you know, could be a little laborious in terms of getting the insights for the types of information we were looking for. And I think what Tableau has enabled DataSift is to look at information very quickly, so we can iterate and come up with different options or different ideas or hypotheses very quickly and validate some of our answers and conclusions, and just provide some very nice aesthetic results, you know, that we can do for blogs and promotional pieces as well. Tableau: Has Tableau allowed for new insights into your data? Todd: We provide social data and social data processing, and what Tableau does so well is really highlight the value of social data by providing rapid dashboards and different types of insights, and looking at social data in different ways that people can't do. Tableau really highlights that value prop of social data in in social data analytics. Tableau: How do customers react to Tableau? Tim: Customers react very positively when we show them the combination of DataSift and Tableau. You know, DataSift does all the heavy lifting in terms of aggregating data across many, many sources and putting it into a neat package. But sometimes those datasets are quite large, and Tableau does an amazing job of, you know, visualizing what types of insights are actually buried in there. You know, there's always things that you don't expect to see, and Tableau allows those things to jump right out at customers. Tableau: How has Tableau been as a partner? James: It's fantastic. The cultures are we've got a really good cultural fit, and the combination of DataSift and Tableau is really compelling for customers. Todd: I would say from a partnership perspective Tableau's just been a great partner in terms of, you know, we've done promotional materials together, we've done a number of events together, and just a lot of great professionals and a lot of great people to work with, and have been just a tremendous partner. James: So working with Tableau here in Europe, we get access to this community of users and customers who have so much enthusiasm and passion for what Tableau is already doing for them. And when they can see what they can achieve when they add in social data using the DataSift platform, it just opens up so many possibilities for them. Working with Tableau here in Europe is great fun, because the Tableau team, they've got so much passion, so much energy, and that really rubs off when we talk with clients together and the opportunity that the combination of DataSift and Tableau offers to clients makes it great fun to work together."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: What are the data challenges in manufacturing?\nDan Meier, Manufacturing IT Expert: Manufacturers in general have a lot of data but they don't use it very effectively. Tableau has a terrific environment to be able to make information out of that data. Tableau: What kinds of data are involved?\nDan: Data is used in many different areas. We use data from the perspective of monitoring the flow of work in progress through the manufacturing area. We monitor the time at step, individual steps, and monitor whether a step is taking more or less time over time. We monitor how many orders we get from customers and the order flow rate. We monitor the rate at which we ship orders to customers and the revenue that's generated from that. So it really permeates every part of the commercial perspective of the business, but we can also look at it from a process engineering standpoint as well. We can look at scrap. We can look at improving yield within the manufacturing environment. And we can dig down deeply into the data to make associations that help us determine root cause for a lot of the issues. Tableau: What does Tableau help you do with that data?\nDan: Tableau really allows us to be able to get a good picture about the causes, the problems, and allows us to quickly identify and correct them to be able to improve our manufacturing processes. Tableau: Does any philosophy influence your analysis of data?\nDan: We use lean manufacturing principles. These are very key within our environment. To be able to perform the analysis on the data, to be able to look at problems, and again one of the core competencies of Six Sigma is being able to determine root cause and to be able to address root cause. Tableau is really very, very effective for that. Part of the guiding principle of the ISO9001 quality system within manufacturing is that everybody needs to understand the progress of manufacturing, how you're doing against your goals. And Tableau for us was a key part of not only managing goals but also managing our performance against the goals. So ultimately, we wanted everybody in the facility to be able to have access to that kind of information. And so everybody then begins to not only work with the same sets of data, a single source of truth, but also begins to see the possibilities and options that they can have through exploring this information, looking at the data in ways that they were never able to before. Tableau: How often do you work with data?\nDan: We slice and dice the data all the time, and through slicing and dicing the data being able to turn it upside down on its head we frequently find insights. Tableau: Why are self-service analytics so important?\nDan: If we have 100 engineers in manufacturing, maybe 20 of those engineers know how to write a SQL query, but maybe only three or four or five of those engineers have access to the database to be able to get the information that they need."

        "content": "Tableau: You\u2019re known as \u201cthe Father of Data Warehousing.\u201d How did you move from that to your current focus on unstructured data?\nBill Inmon, Owner: I originally thought up the idea of data warehousing and started writing books about it. I wrote the first book about it, I ran the first conference about data warehousing. So most people know about me from my experience with data warehouse. In reality, for the past 10 years or so I've been working on unstructured data. At Forest Rim we take unstructured textual data and turn it into a database. Now, we've been doing this for a number of years, and we discovered that, uh, people don't really want to buy databases. It was only until we took the results of what we did, put it into Tableau, that people suddenly understood what we were doing and said, gee, that's really what I want for my business. Tableau: Why do you think it made such a difference?\nBill: The difference between showing somebody raw data and showing them visualized data is truly night and day. And I say that not because I love Tableau or anything, I say that because it's true. All of a sudden they can see relationships, they can see visualizations, they it comes alive for them. And it's that coming alive that gets our customers to the point of buying our product. Tableau was just a natural fit with what we do. In terms of seeing the power of Tableau, it was all measured in the difference that it made in our customers' faces. We used to see customers looking and looking at a database and they were polite but they would say, what's this? And the minute that we took the results and put them in Tableau, the light bulbs went off. So our proof in the pudding was the light bulbs going off in our customers' eyes. Tableau: What would the impact be if you didn\u2019t have Tableau?\nBill: If we didn't have Tableau as a tool, it would be very difficult for us to explain the value proposition of what we do. I mean, it's made the difference between having an easy sale and a very difficult sale. Tableau will be with us as long as we like to make sales. It's pretty simple what the biggest value of using Tableau is. It means that we get to where the customer wants to pay us money for our product. And that's really basic and really simple. It's pretty easy to explain Tableau to other people. Tableau is what turns the lights on in the room, that we do things, we do some incredibly difficult things, but in terms of people understanding what we do, it's only when we put it in Tableau that that understanding comes easy. I liken what we do to a relay race in track. In a relay race in track one person starts off and around the track and takes the baton, another person takes the baton and -- and the next thing you know is the final person gets the baton and crosses the finish line. Tableau has made it possible for us to illustrate to our customer base what we do. And I'm just delighted that we have the relationship with Tableau."

        "content": "Bussan Auto Finance (BAF) was established in 1997 and is currently one of the trusted financing companies for Yamaha motorcycles in Indonesia. It has 173 branches, over 168 points of service, and employs more than 9,000 people. To date, BAF has served more than 6 million customers and has assets totaling over US$900 million. To take advantage of the vast amount of information available, BAF engaged CYBERTREND to deploy Tableau Software as a data analytics solution. BAF has since been able to identify market trends and gain insights into information like customers\u2019 profiles, behavior and payment preferences from the data. With the information, it has improved on work processes for its field staff and streamlined overall operations. BAF operates in a massive motorcycle market. In 2013, there were more than 7.7 million motorcycles sold in Indonesia according to the ASEAN Automotive Federation (AAF). This accounted for 70 percent of total commercial vehicle sales in ASEAN. In 2014, motorcycle sales in Indonesia is expected to grow by another 5 percent and total 8 million units sold. To gain insights into market trends and to better understand customer preferences and behavior, companies in Indonesia are turning to business intelligence and data analytics tools. Financial services companies like BAF are also relying on data analytics to look into customer purchase and payment histories, preferred payment methods, loan servicing records, etc., to come up with products and services that better meet customer needs while minimizing risks. To maintain a competitive advantage, BAF needed a data analytics tool that is fast, easy to use, and beneficial to the entire company. BAF also required a solution that could offer a common point of reference for all employees. This, the management believes, would help to keep everyone on the same page and better align the entire team to decision making processes. \u201cWe wanted an analytical tool that can help us easily understand data, make informed decisions and take appropriate actions as a company,\u201d said Andi Tirta, General Manager, Risk Management, BAF. \u201cWhen everyone on the team is able to understand the analysis, it makes it easier for us to make the right decisions and follow through with the decisions that have been made. This allows us to not only improve our working styles, but also become more cost efficient,\u201d he added. BAF turned to its technology partner PT CYBERTREND INTRABUANA for a data warehousing and business intelligence solution. PT CYBERTREND recommended Tableau, and business users at BAF were impressed by the software\u2019s ability to process data from multiple sources and present the discoveries in easy-to-interpret visualizations after trying it. They also liked the fact that the Tableau comes with easy-to-use, drag-and-drop features. The BAF team now taps on Tableau to drive business decisions, and the software has improved the quality of discussions and cut down tremendously on data crunching time. The number of Tableau users at BAF quickly grew from 40 to 240 within one year. They are mainly assistant managers and managers from departments like Marketing, Operations, Information Technology and Risk Management. Others are branch heads and data analysts. More than half of the senior management team also uses the software. Together, they analyze about five TB of data blended from several different sources each month. Since adopting Tableau, BAF has improved its overall operational effectiveness and efficiency, leading to a reduction in operational losses of more than US$ 1 million in one year. Additionally, BAF is now able to gain invaluable insights from its data, and confidently plan expansions of its business portfolio. \u201cSpeed is the biggest benefit that Tableau brings to the table. Data analysis is quick and report distribution becomes very efficient with Tableau, while process reviews are much easier and quicker. The visualizations that are produced by Tableau help us to make better-informed decisions, improve the quality of our discussions and reduce the time required to prepare the data. Overall, Tableau has helped us to cut analysis time from two days to one hour,\u201d commented Andi. Most importantly, Andi feels that the BAF staff now \u2018speaks the same language\u2019 when it comes to decision making and taking actions that are supported by data and information. Andi said: \u201cOur actions are now guided by insights gained from Tableau analysis. These reports and visualizations can be accessed anytime using the Internet. They allow for a common point of reference. Tableau has become an integral part of the way we make informed decisions as a company, as these decisions are based on the analysis done by different members of a team.\u201d Next on the agenda, BAF plans to introduce Tableau to its dealers and partners. The aim is for BAF and its partners to transition to Tableau together and construct a single view on performances. In turn, the alignment should streamline business processes, allowing for mutual sharing of data, and build synergy across the companies."

        "content": "Metro is an established retail brand and progressive retail business under Metro Holdings, a property and investment group with a turnover of more than S$194.3 million in FY2014. Metro operates a chain of five department stores in Singapore. The Metro team constantly collects a variety of data at these stores to gain valuable insights into peak and lull shopping periods, inventory flow, and customer purchase behaviors. By analyzing the trends, the team is able to effectively plan operational and promotional strategies and consistently improve efficiency and sales performance. With help from the rapid-fire analytics software Tableau, Metro has successfully integrated the use of data analytics into its retail operation. With this, the company has enhanced the way departments work and communicate with each other, streamlined logistical support to retail outlets, and designed customer-centric promotional campaigns. Singapore\u2019s retail landscape\nThe wholesale and retail sector is one of the largest contributors to Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), generating an estimated S$55 billion in 2012. A recent study also puts Singapore among the top 20 retail markets in the world. Retail stores in Singapore, such as Metro, also create jobs for over 100,000 workers nationwide . Metro\u2019s management realized early that shoppers are now making more informed buying decisions, mainly due to the accessibility and convenience of online shopping. The team needed to quickly react to changes in the market landscape to remain competitive. To do that, they needed an effective business intelligence tool to accurately slice and dice the data and help them gain insights into their business and the market. Data challenges and key considerations\nMetro\u2019s Head Business Analytics, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Merchandise Controller Erwin Oei shared that his team was looking into transforming data from multiple sources into useful information. Additionally, they wanted an easy-to-learn, fast-to-implement solution. However, they quickly ran into a number of initial hurdles. They were faced with data in many different formats coming from different sources. \u201cWe had sales data in data source A, transactions data from source B, and customer data from source C. To put all these together, we need to extract data from multiple sources,\u201d said Erwin. Managing the large quantity of data that they have was also a major challenge. Erwin explained: \u201cWe keep about 10 years\u2019 worth of historical data comprising detailed information like customer purchase and payment methods, and supply chain history\u2014this amounts to many terabytes of data.\u201d Previously, the team used spreadsheets to analyze some of the data. Staff had to manually retrieve selected data and key them into a system for them to be analyzed\u2014an extremely time-consuming process. The IT department also received multiple requests for help in creating reports. This created frustrating bottlenecks that IT could not fully clear. It took weeks before a report could be produced, by which time the business situation may have already changed. Long term solution\nThe Metro team decided on Tableau after evaluating several business intelligence solutions in the market. \u201cWe feel that Tableau is the only solution available in the market that allows for the fast implementation of data analytics,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cWith Tableau, what used to take us weeks has now been reduced to seconds. One of the core priorities in our decision making process was that the solution must be easy for the end user to learn and use,\u201d he added. Currently, Metro analyzes data from a centralized data bank using Tableau. Almost all the key executives and backend users have access to the software. Nine dashboards have been created covering sales performance, inventory tracking, and customer relationship management. With fast and flexible data analysis, the Metro team is able to specifically target shoppers with specialized marketing campaigns. Tableau analysis on supply chain data has allowed the team to effectively and efficiently manage its inventory costs. \u201cAnalyzing customers\u2019 buying history, we are able to develop customer behavior profiles and determine the types of products that they prefer. With this, we can specifically target them with promotions most appealing and relevant to them, helping us to save on advertising costs and improving customer satisfaction,\u201d said Erwin. Tableau has also opened up a variety of opportunities for Metro. One example is when the Metro team looked into data of popular shoe sizes and discovered that customers rarely purchased half sizes. As a result, the retailer stocked more of the popular sizes and significantly reduced the problem of overstock of inventory. In turn, this has led to savings in markdowns, storage costs, and opportunity costs. The company actively tracks the in-store movement and buying behavior of its customers to determine key shopping days down to the time of day. With this information, management is able to deploy staff to the different departments on the sales floor, as well as strategically organize the floor space to stimulate customer purchases. Metro\u2019s data-driven culture\nDecision making across Metro has evolved from that of a personal experience or \u2018gut feel\u2019 to that of being data driven, information supported and more scientific approach, according to Erwin. The company has also set up a Business Analytics division to spearhead the \u2018data revolution\u2019. The team has since been integrating data analytics into almost every part of its operations and Tableau has quite literally changed the way the company works. Metro is actively building a data-driven culture across the organization. Erwin believes that this would be helpful not just for decision makers but also the employees at the frontline in the retail business. These are the people who are key customer touch points, and instrumental in driving the business forward. Erwin believes that it is beneficial for these employees to see and understand the data and understand the rationale behind key decisions. \u201cTableau has helped empower our end users\u2014the people who drive the business. Users are able to personally interact with the data and come up with their own conclusions. This has greatly increased our overall productivity and helped us to effectively manage costs and increase sales. Also, unproductive hours spent on manual extraction of data and creating reports have been cut down,\u201d Erwin summed up. In the two years that Metro Singapore has started implementing Tableau, it has had such a significant impact on Metro\u2019s business that the company plans to push data analytics to its nine stores in Indonesia."

At the same time, the company wanted a tool that could be easily understood and used by its team of visualization and data experts to derive insights for customers. Practising the science of data analytics\nBlueocean had been using Tableau 7 in a few of its IP solutions, and had selected Corporate Renaissance Group (CRG) as a partner to help deploy the tool. During the deployment stage, CRG was able to share industry best practices and co-partner on pilots, allowing Blueocean to get a better perspective on how to make the most of Tableau. Blueocean subsequently upgraded to a newer version, Tableau 8.1, and as the company continued to work with Tableau, it began to realize that this would, in fact, be the best choice for its new event-based retail intelligence solution, Retail Intelligence on Demand. It therefore decided to take advantage of Tableau 8.1\u2019s rich functionalities to deliver greater value to clients. The solution received great traction from customers for its ability to provide timely and accurate data that allowed customers to evaluate and respond to competitive tactics and consumer behaviour. Ensuring a 360 degrees approach to visualisation and analytics\nAt an overall level, Blueocean uses Tableau to synthesise data from multiple formats such as transactional, research, social media and other behavioural data sources such as SAP databases, Adobe digital analytics, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, other social media channels, CRM and ERP systems, etc. ; working on a cloud based environment to store and process that data. The company builds data visualizations in Tableau Desktop and then publishes its analyses to Tableau Server to share insights and support collaboration. The quantum of data is ever-increasing and on an average, Blueocean works on more than a million data points on a monthly basis using Tableau. This has helped Blueocean Market Intelligence effectively democratise data internally as well as to its clients. \u201cTrue intelligence comes from a well-grounded, triangulated view of data that\u2019s sitting in silos across our customer organization. The ability of Tableau to integrate into different scenarios and bring out the best insight in such a simplistic but powerful manner helps us deliver greater value to clients.\u201d says Anees Merchant, Blueocean Market Intelligence. The company was also able to drastically reduce the time to market for the \u2018Retail Intelligence on Demand\u2019 solution. In a week, the company was able to create a prototype and go live as compared to working on a traditional platform which would have taken almost eight weeks of effort. \u201cTableau has helped us bring colour to visualization and the art of storytelling. I would propagate Tableau to every organization that has a mature outlook towards business intelligence. If organizations are looking to embark on analytics journey and don\u2019t want to invest on cumbersome and resource-intensive solutions, I would definitely recommend Tableau,\u201d Merchant says."

In video 2, he shares the story of how they were able to identify and fix a bottleneck in their process. In video 3, Renato talks about working with Tableau partner, Head Innovations. (All videos in Portuguese) Tableau: What has Tableau meant for your company? Renato Chapchap, Superintendent of Operations: Today, Tableau has become essential. A month ago, we made a change of server in which we went two days without Tableau, my supervisor of an area of operations came and begged at my desk Put Tableau on the air, I can't work without the tool, We understand that Tableau is not just a tool, it's changing the company culture. It's surgical, it tells you, oh, you have to act here because of that. Nowadays we practically don't go looking for where the problem is, it's already... signaling that. I think that, in terms of productivity, we increased quite a bit. Today we can do more with less. Now, we have even had a reduction of resources in the area of operations through agility, through quick information, because of the Tableau tool. Tableau: Has Tableau helped you become more efficient? Chapchap: We had very large productivity gains. It took a lot of man hours working on some reports that today are ready beforehand, automated. With the tool, I think the gain in terms of response time is very large, it's very large. And economies of scale are also very large. It's something you do for a client or for an area. You can do a rollout of it for the entire enterprise in one click, it's very simple. Tableau: Would you recommend Tableau to others? Chapchap: Today, after almost a year and half, using the Tableau tool, I would recommend it to almost everyone, except for my competitors. Tableau: Just how speedy has Tableau made your business? Chapchap: Today when we talk about automation of some reports, we can gain in scale, gain flexibility, some reports we issued monthly, could be issued biweekly, weekly and if the customer needs it, even daily, because the report is ready. That is, the effort that we'll have to make providing that information is the same, it's a click. That's basically it, so today we have a very quick response time for the client, for any request for any information, in any report. A data-driven process for problem-solving Tableau: What\u2019s a situation where Tableau was crucial? Chapchap: There was a specific process, in the operations area, it was one of the most critical processes in the area of operations. I had gotten the message very clearly, dive into that process and fix it. When we simply measured the process from beginning to end we saw that it was delaying a cycle, it was taking cycle time above what it should have, but we didn't know exactly where to act, but where... in which step of that workflow the bottleneck was. When we plugged Tableau into the databases, we found some other data, some intermediate dates where we managed to isolate the ones responsible for each step of the process. So we found exactly where the bottleneck was in that process, we were able to make an action plan and it's now a fully controlled process in terms of mean and standard deviation in cycle time. That was something that Tableau provided that before, in the reports that we took directly from the system. Tableau: So Tableau helped you see what was wrong? Chapchap: We were a little lost as to where to act, where the root cause of that problem was, we couldn't see it directly. We found that it was a, then it was much more a laboratory, right, let's test here, let's test there, but in fact we had not gotten to the root cause until Tableau brought us - Look! It's that agent, it's that step of that process that has the cycle time above our expectation. We're going to understand why and we\u00b4re going to act here. Tableau: Is there local support for Tableau? Chapchap: Later when we went to Tableau Server, we contacted... Head Innovations here in Brazil, where they give advice on any purchase of Tableau Server, and from that moment they became our contact, our focal point for Tableau here in Brazil, for any problem, any question or assistance, or support we need, we contact them directly. Tableau: Has this been helpful? Chapchap: I think having that local contact is very important, even for a little help for us and to grow along with the tool. and they had a very proactive position as follows - Look, we'll help you and we want you guys to retain the knowledge here, that is, it wasn't an attitude of \"I want to create a dependency on Head Innovations for the company,\" I think that it was an attitude which... I found very noble. They want to pass on that know-how about how to deal with... how to work with the tool, how to fully exploit the tool, they want to pass that on to us, for us to retain that knowledge. I think that was key, and local support is very important because the tool, as I said earlier, has a phase of maturation in the company's culture. So today, it may be that we don't need so much support, tomorrow, it may be that we will need more, after tomorrow, much more. So it's always nice to have someone close by and be able to rely on that, on a phone call, we have a direct phone number of the associates at the company if a quick response is needed."

        "content": "Health care is increasingly data-driven and careful analysis can uncover ways to improve patient care, patient experience ad overall operations. In these three videos, Waseem Ali, Group Performance & Information Manager for Virgin Care discusses the importance of using data to improve healthcare, the Tableau adoption process (video 2), and his company's experience with Tableau Server (video 3). Tableau: Medicine is driven more and more by technology. How does Tableau help you turn data into intelligence? Waseem Ali, Group Performance & Information Manager: Using intelligence from data makes a difference to the whole patient life cycle and actually, in turn, helps us improve our services a little bit better. We have about 230-odd services within Virgin Care. And -- and to kind of lead on the reporting and the analysis and everything that we kind of send on to the NHS after that to kind of centralize that and try and report on it. So I've got a team responsible for all of that. And Tableau is a very, very big part of that. Tableau: Is Tableau allowing you to do use data in new ways? Waseem: We're starting to do more operational reports for our individual services. Allowing our managers to help use the data to manage our service better and make improvements so that we can kind of improve the experience for the patient at the end of the day. The impact that Tableau's had within Virgin Care has been substantial I think in the sense that the visibility of the data that people are getting now is far greater than they've ever done before. So if there are problematic areas, teams within the organization can actually go in and find out what's going on. So we're kind of -- I think the impact has been that it's encouraging a lot more people to use the data to help improve our services and see where we're doing well as well, because that's just as important. Tableau: What sort of things are you finding with Tableau? Waseem: We used our reporting mechanism to highlight an issue. And then the specialist team went away and found the problem and has worked on a solution that they're working on. Tableau: What was the response when you introduced the software to hospital staff: Waseem: We're a Virgin company, so we always try and innovate. And so Tableau was one of the big innovations that we kind of invested into in 2012. I think the initial reaction for our colleagues within Virgin Care when they first see Tableau is usually, \"Wow.\" And it's like, okay, I'm seeing the data in a totally different way. Tableau: Did you consider other BI solutions? Waseem: We did go out and we did get free samples of kind of the free downloads of various different BI tools out there\u2014 I don't think I need to mention any of them. We downloaded a lot of them, and actually we gave it to our analysts and we said, \"You know what? Go away. Give me something. Create me something out of it.\" And the quickest and the easiest tool to use was Tableau. Within half an hour of not knowing Tableau, our analysts were able to deliver dashboards, which was fantastic. Tableau: How many different services or systems are using Tableau? Waseem: Virgin Care's unique in the sense that we've got lots of different services and lots of different service types. And we've got lots of different systems for the different service types we have. And the way the business model works, we inherit systems as we win services. And so in terms of quantity of data, probably won't be able to give you an exact on that, but we are -- we are churning thousands and thousands, hundreds of thousands of rows of information. We're currently connecting to a SQL data warehouse. And we've got a couple of data warehouses that we connect Tableau to, and we're using that for reporting purposes. Again, just because of the pure nature of our business, we do sometimes take on services or win services that have Excel-based systems. We can do kind of quick wins through connecting Tableau to Excel and I think one of the key features is the blending of the data. So we can connect to SQL, we can connect to Excel, and we can blend it all together. Tableau: How did you implement the software? Did you run a trial before expanding its use? Waseem: When we first started Tableau, we made the decision to kind of pilot it with our executive team and kind of share Tableau with them and share the benefits of Tableau with them. And kind of from that, the executive team really liked the reports that we were producing, liked the visibility of the data they were seeing and kind of the flexibility of the tool. And it kind of cascaded down the organization from there. At the moment, we have probably about 500-odd users that -- that are on Tableau Server. We're producing a number of reports for our exec and our board and kind of a few layers down as well, which shows basically what we've managed to do through Tableau is centralize all information for our 230-odd services and report it through one medium, and Tableau being that medium. Tableau: What aspect of the software has been most valuable for you? Waseem: Tableau Server was always an important part of implementing Tableau in our organization. And I think the most -- the most benefits and the kind of most important part of it is that users can go online and see their reports. They don't need to go onto -- some sort of connection or view a report through a file. It's just all online, and they can interact online. As an analytical team\u2014and I think a lot of people will relate to me when I say this\u2014is actually whenever you produce a report for someone and send it out, the answer is always, \"You know what? That's great, but we would also like this.\" Tableau: How has Tableau affected your daily work? Waseem: The impact that Tableau has kind of had on me and kind of the work that I do is just the ability to sit there and create analytics within minutes and not spend hours looking at Excel data sets and manipulating information using pivot tables doing that. I can literally do it in seconds. And I've actually sat in meetings where people have been questioning data and done real, live analytics there and then, which makes a massive impact to any meeting. I always take my laptop with me so that I can there and then do analytics on any service improvement plans that we're making. I can produce stats there and then, which saves on workload for the team and it's less headache for me. Life without Tableau? I think life without Tableau will be very, very difficult because I think we've done a good job at spreading the culture of insight into data and intelligence, I think it will almost be a case of taking a number of steps back. Not even one step back, a number of steps back."

        "content": "Tableau: The use of advanced analytics is widespread in baseball and becoming more common in American football. What about football?\nBrian Prestidge, Head of Analytical Development for Bolton Wanderers Football Club: Analysis in football has been around for a long time, but real data analytics? It's only in its early stages now. It could be from Access databases, Excel databases, SQL, some from internal, some from external data providers. And all that information is related to injury, training intensity, training loads, performance in matches, where events happen on the pitch, recovery methods. There's so many vast amounts. We've got over 50 databases all collecting different information. We collect thousands of data points every single week. Prior to Tableau, it was just an absolute mess, if I'm honest. Tableau: So you're collecting all this data. How does Tableau help you analyze that information? Have you found that the software has made player assessment more efficient?\nBrian: One of the key things that we use Tableau for is our mapping of our player recruitment. So we need to identify where our targets and markets are. And Tableau's mapping functionality is fantastic for that. It enables us to actually identify where players are that suit our player profile, and more importantly, to monitor those players and how they're doing. And to evaluate, perhaps, the percentages of players that are getting A and B ratings, again, higher ratings of players that we sort of want to recruit compared to countries that perhaps, actually, it's a waste of resources, both human and financial, to send scouts into that area to recruit players when, actually, we should be going to this area or that area. And Tableau Maps are fantastic for that because they've guided us. Tableau: Which Tableau products are the most useful for you?\nBrian: We've got one Tableau Desktop, which I myself create the dashboards after consultations with various members of staff so we can really make sure that the dashboards are designed around them. And then we have Tableau Server, and absolutely everyone's involved. I'm talking from coaches who have never touched computers before down to our sports scientists. So we've got a vast range of people. And that was something we took into consideration when bringing in Tableau because we had to bring in a product that was suitable for all people, and not only the staff we've got now, but the staff we might have this time next year or the year after that. It needs to be agile to adapt with our company. Tableau: Has Tableau made any difference to your daily work?\nBrian: So, personally, I mean, I've absolutely loved it. It's been fantastic. It's made my job so much easier in terms of the, what I'd call, the \"boring work.\" And it's actually allowed me to get more hands on with data. Not only that, actually get other people more hands on with data. Which means if they're hands on with it, they're the experts in their field, they can look at the data that's related to their field. And, therefore, I can have communications with them about, right, where are we going to go now? What questions do you want to answer and how can we we be a bit more predictive in what we're doing? A bit more objective in what we're doing? Actually be at the forefront of data analytics in football. Tableau: You have several different people using the software. What's been the reaction to Tableau throughout the club?\nBrian: I was astounded. I thought, \u201cThis is exactly what we need.\u201d The variety of dashboards was the key thing. Everyone's a different learner. So we need different ways of visualizing our data. Tableau: Has Tableau changed the way you use and interpret data?\nBrian: Tableau's enabled us to get deeper insights a lot quicker. We're able to actually understand our data. So rather than just being information that's just stored in the database, we're actually able to utilize this information to make daily decisions, even hourly decisions, and that's key in football. We need to be able to make decisions quickly and they need to be objective. And It's enabled us to work smarter, definitely. Tableau: How much data are you collecting and what were you doing with it?\nBrian: We've been taking unstructured and structured data in from various sources for a long time now. The problem has been most of it has been unusable. So we've had this massive amount of data just collected, and we've not been able to do anything with it. We're collecting over 6,000 XML files every single season, and to make any sense of that, to actually make decisions from a player recruitment perspective, we needed the power of Alteryx, and the user-friendliness of it as well, to be able to actually parse the data. And then not just parse it but actually use predictive analytics tools to actually gain deep insight and to actually understand which players are going to benefit our club. Tableau: What kind of support have you gotten in using the software?\nBrian: The help we've had, the hands-on help, I suppose, we've had from the Information Lab, The support we've had from both Tableau and Alteryx has been fantastic, both across the phone, e-mail, and in person. It's been great because it's enabled us to create not just the basic-level dashboards that perhaps we would have done if we didn't have that help, but we've been able to advance our work and adapt it to make it very relevant to the individuals and to be able to deliver the insights that we actually want as a club. Tableau: George, you had a few questions for Brian?\nAlteryx president George Mathew: So what are some of the things that you're getting from that XML data itself? What's the source content look like these days, particularly for the sports analytics that you're starting to drive?\nBrian: We get location information. So that's based upon, you know, where are events happening, what the type of event is, whoever is challenged or unchallenged, who's involved with it, and the outcome of that. Now, that, to us, provides a very basic level of information, but we need to delve deeper, look at the relationships, look at where on the pitch things are actually happening, so not just an X/Y coordinate but actually is that X/Y coordinate within a penalty area. Is it within a six yard box? Is it within a zone that's actually a good goal score in efficiency zones? That's a benefit that the special analytic tool has allowed us within Alteryx. George: You mentioned that the pitches are different in every situation. How do you normalize that? How do you make it seamless to blend that information as you're then doing the visual analysis in Tableau?\nBrian: Every single pitch in football is different. So when we get these XML files, and you can't just say, \u201cRight, if the ball is here, that means it's in the penalty area, if the ball is there it's in the sort of on the halfway line,\u201d because everything is different. Tableau: How do you turn those basic coordinates into something more relevant?\nBrian: We have to use the sort of some generic coordinates, which show the sides of the pitch, so we can then draw a pitch using the tools within Alteryx. Not only then draw the pitch but draw the halfway line, draw the 18 yard box, draw the six-yard box and any of the zone that we may want to. Like, we split the pitch into left, central and right, as well as into thirds, going up the pitch. So we're able to do that using the spatial tools, and then use spatial match just to identify where events are happening within those areas. Tableau: How did you manage all this information before you adopted Tableau and Alteryx? Where you able to digitally recreate the pitch?\nBrian: Prior to having the XML is we'd get CSV file, and that basically provides us with very generic information about what's going on on the pitch. The key thing it doesn't provide is locations, locations, X/Y coordinates. We don't get that, which means that realistically we don't know how effective a pass was, how effective a cross was. Whereas actually having that location, having those coordinates and making sense of them in Alteryx means that we can start to create strategies for training, right? Have the team done what we were asking of them? Is the pattern of play what we wanted? When we're looking at opponents, what's their pattern of play, how can we counteract that? And it's all actionable insight, it's all things that actually influence training on a daily basis and influence not only team selection, but team strategy for match day."

The turnaround to answers with many questions that we get would usually take weeks and properly so in many instances. Tableau has provided us a way to quickly answer our customers, because they need the information now. They need it within days, not weeks, or months. Tableau: What does Tableau allow you to do with data exactly?\nLuke: Tableau has offered new ways of connection of data. We have online and cloud space, we also have socio-demographic values that exist that we could blend in with our data maybe to tell a different story, or to provide value to our data. Tableau: Has Tableau spread through your company?\nLuke: So we have had Tableau for just a few years and it's been recently deployed through our enterprise and charged the atmosphere for new ways of looking at our data and to get quicker answers than we had before. Our leadership has been inspired by our ability to share this information in a succinct and clear way and they can understand the story quickly. Tableau: Are you able to use Tableau on different platforms?\nLuke: We love the flexibility of Tableau publishing. Some of our users do use small tablet devices, like an iPad. So this gives us the opportunity to publish and to provide a mobile experience and they can use the web or Tableau Mobile, and view them within the format of that device, really quickly, and then share with others. It delights me that my company has entrusted me the ability to empower others with this information and to excite them about what they do and how they can serve our members better and put a smile on their face. Tableau: How did things start with Tableau?\nLuke: We started off with about 20 licenses of Tableau, just to make sure is this one going to work, is this what we need? And it quickly grew. We knew we needed more. The speed to insight was fantastic. Turnaround for information was phenomenal. So now we've deployed it across the system. We have more than 200 people using licenses. Many customers from small groups who need detailed information and their eyes only to see, to large KPI dashboards to disclose to all of our employees. A favorite quote of mine is what you see and hear depends a great deal on where you're standing. And Tableau provides a landscape perspective that we couldn't supply before. Tableau: What\u2019s a specific area where Tableau is helpful?\nLuke: One of my favorite pieces of work in Tableau has been to assist in product development. I don't typically work in that space. They were looking for a new way to engage the member and to bring price transparency to the member, to help reduce the burden of their healthcare expenses, while at the same time not competing with our providers who are also trying to serve the members, as well. Tableau has allowed us with our data to bring in many internal customers and departments to collaborate around price transparency and we are making strides to do just that for our members. We're looking for new ways to bring better information to our members and to all of our customers to improve their experience and improve their outcomes. It creates a way for us to create new opportunities and new questions for new projects that we have to work on. We love our data. Our data is up to date and refreshed and able for us to use in many BI tools already. Tableau allows us to go further and to bring us closer into a more intimate display of the information. Tableau: How does Tableau help with customer service?\nLuke: Our customer service center is second to none. A member calls in and they're connected with a representative quickly who can answer them. We want to apply that within the institution so that when my customer asks me a question about data I can turn around and say here's the answer, It gave me quick intimacy with the data and to understand what happens. I have a background in operations so I kind of already know how that data is supplied. But, Tableau offered me quicker access to new levels and new dimensions that I didn't have before, or couldn't access at that speed. We were able to quickly turn our data into information that could then be understood, not at just low levels in operations, but also to leadership and executives who are constantly being bombarded with information having to make decisions But, at the end of the day, we need to get the right information into our customer's hands, whether it's our member, or whether it's my employer over here that needs the support."

In this video, data analyst Krystal St. Julien discusses how \u201cyou can connect Tableau to almost anything\u201d\u2014turning data into insight that drives this rapidly-growing business. In video 2, Krystal talks about blending diverse data in Tableau. Tableau: What led ModCloth to choose Tableau? Krystal St. Julien, Data Analyst: We really brought Tableau on because of the obvious ease of use and the quickness to which you can get to your answer. I don't think there are any limits on the data we've been able to deliver to our stakeholders. It used to be every time you needed one bit of data, I'm going to submit a ticket to the analytics team, I'm going to wait however long it takes for the analysts to get to my request, and then if I need to iterate, I have to do the same thing over and over again. And now you know, if it's a simple data pool, immediate results. If it's an ad-hoc question, again, immediate results. Tableau: Where do you use Tableau?\nKrystal: We use it everywhere. In our warehouse, we have questions around what's going on with our product, what's going on with shipments, who is ordering our product, are the people who are ordering actually people who say they are those people, or are they somebody fraudulent, how can we catch those things? And recently, we've been getting a lot of project managers on the product team really interested in using Tableau as a reporting mechanism as well. Tableau: How has Tableau changed your job?\nKrystal: I now spend a lot of my time on predictive analytics doing more of the fun deep dive types of projects that I've always wanted to do rather than just reporting or dashboarding, because stakeholders can do that themselves.  Tableau: What kind of data do you have?\nKrystal: The majority of the data we serve is from the analytics team data warehouse. We actually take data from across the company and source it into our own data warehouse, so it's a good, solid repository of information. But we do also connect directly to other warehouses around the org. Our data warehouse is a Redshift data warehouse, but we also connect to PostgreSQL warehouses, MySQL warehouses, obviously sometimes people want to use their own spreadsheets, so Excel is a definite. I also use direct connection to Google Analytics. So all over the place. And blending is definitely something that happens all the time. Tableau: What does Tableau allow you to do with all that data?\nKrystal: Since our data warehouse on our team is a central repository that takes in data from across the company, one of the things that's been really great is we can demo how we want to use certain pieces of data, how we might deploy certain pieces of data via Tableau before it's been sent to our data warehouse. And this is great because we can send a full spec sheet of use cases, what we want our columns to look like. Basically, (what we want) our dimensions and measures to look like, what aggregations we're going to need, how our stakeholders use that information. Because we have been beta'ing it, basically, since you can connect Tableau to almost anything. So that has helped a lot in efficiency of making sure that as the data comes into our central warehouse, it's done in the way that is most helpful to the analytics team, and then the company at large. Tableau: Do you use Tableau on different devices and operating systems?\nKrystal: We have a ton of super users on finance, and they are a Windows-mostly shop, and we are a Mac-mostly shop on the analytics team. We share workbooks all the time, no problem. Tableau: Who are you mostly working with when it comes to Tableau?\nKrystal: Our home tech office is San Francisco. And I would say those stakeholders probably get the most help from us just because of locale. People can run down to my desk and ask me questions at any moment. In our LA office, it's all of our buyers, assortment planners, you know, how are people purchasing product? What are the historicals on that? How do we take that into account as far as planning for future purchases? Yeah, and then in the San Francisco office, we have HR uses it to look at retention. We have, obviously, my team uses it for projects serving algorithms, experimentation and exploration, marketing uses it for a lot of reporting. There's a ton of year over year, week over week, month over month kind of trending and reporting we have to do. Tableau: Was it easy to get started with Tableau?\nKrystal: Basically, I came into my company and within a month was training people on Tableau. And I kept getting the question, \"How long have you been here?\" Oh, a month, you know, two months. It was just that easy to pick it up. Tableau: How does Tableau save you work?\nKrystal: I think in the last quarter, it was something like 200 requests that we would have had to fulfill got fulfilled direct by stakeholder by us serving Tableau to them."

        "content": "Tableau: What\u2019s one way Tableau has helped the Rangers?\nSarah Stone, Marketing & Advertising manager: In the baseball world, promotions and giveaways are a huge part of the culture of coming to a game experience. And one of the things that Tableau really helped us with to get this thing started was to look at our attendance over the past five years, and notice when the nights that had promotions and giveaways such as bobble heads or T-shirts or fireworks really boosted attendance in comparison to other games across other years. So when we first started looking at the data, right, we looked over the past five years of attendance and associated it with bobble heads and giveaways So we were looking at the bobble heads schedules, you know, in 2013 and all of our all-fan giveaways were placed on Tuesdays, right? And Tuesday was the only day of the week to actually increase in attendance. You know, it's not a Friday or a Saturday, it's not the weekend. We said, \"Oh, my gosh, like, these things are really moving this day of the week that people didn't normally buy.\" So we then thought, okay, let's try to put another bobblehead in the schedule at the end of the season. So we added another Yu Darvish bobble head at the end of September, and we also saw an incremental increase of ticket sales for that specific game. And we did for the first time really use the data to help inform our decisions. Tableau: Has Tableau made a difference in your company\u2019s culture?\nSarah: It's been really cool to see how the whole organization has adopted Tableau and how it's used throughout different departments. We've always had access to the data, but it's been harder to get to, right? It hasn't been as easy to disseminate to everyone. But now, using Tableau, it allows us to connect and then share it with whoever needs to see. Tableau: What does Tableau allow you to do specifically?\nSarah: So without Tableau Server, it would be kind of hard to really implement all the data. But because of Tableau Server, the right people can log in and see the data that applies to them. One thing that's been successful in our organization is going to the box office or to ticket sales or to accounting and saying, \"Let's sit down with your data. We're all working for the same baseball team, this -- we're all trying to sell tickets and help the team win. You can make a dashboard too.\" Tableau: Is using Tableau part of the movement toward better use of data throughout sports?\nSarah: I would just say that at the Texas Rangers, we're really excited to be looking at our data holistically. We really do want to apply, you know, the kind of Sabermetrics mindset to the business side of the front office. And while we're experts at what we do, Tableau's really enabled us to take ahold of the data and see what the numbers are actually telling us. Tableau: What was one of the first projects you tackled with Tableau?\nSarah: So when I was hired by the Rangers in 2013, one of the first things we wanted to do in the marketing department was to take a closer look at our media buys and see how they impacted attendance. And we had everything in Excel spreadsheets. And I said, \"We need to get Tableau on this.\" So we downloaded the free trial and plugged into our Excel spreadsheets, and that's really where it began. But now, with Tableau, it gives people the ability to, like, actually know the exact numbers behind things and say, okay, here's this Wednesday night game. I know the number of people that are coming. I know the number of people that have bought -- for a certain ticket special. I know the next day we have a cap giveaway, so more people might be buying for that game. So I think what Tableau's done, it's just given access to people to our data. Like, we've always had it, but it's enabled us to understand it more, to grasp it more, and to actually start looking at it. Tableau: How did your background in politics influence the adoption of Tableau?\nSarah: I come from the political media buying world, and I used Tableau to track political ad spending. Some people think politics and sports are pretty different. I think they're pretty much the same, right? So I like to think that I took after the great Nate Silver, who started off in sports and then kind of went back to politics and now is back in sports. I mean, he's brilliant, right? So they're similar in a few ways. First of all, they're both seasonal. In the political world, you're working up till election day, you're trying to get votes for this one day, and it's a perishable day. Like, once you passed it, there's nothing else you can do. Same thing goes with baseball. You have your season, it's only a set amount of time, you have to sell tickets for that one day, and once the day happens, there's nothing else you can do. So there's kind of like that micro-seasonality. And then there's the feel of you're leading up to election season and then it's over and you kind of wait for it to begin. Same thing with baseball. You're waiting for opening day to happen, and then once it starts, you go through the whole season, and then it ends again, and then you start preparing for the next one. So they're both very seasonal. The other thing that is similar between politics and sports is that as a marketer working in advertising, we don't really have any control over the product. In campaigning, you don't really have much control over what the candidate says or does. But you're still supposed to be out there promoting them and doing the advertising, all that sort of stuff. The same goes for baseball. We don't have any real control over the product on the field, but we still want to promote the team and the players and support it through advertising. So the -- they're probably similar when it comes down to it."

        "company": "Brooklyn Public Library",
        "content": "The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) system serves the 2.5 million residents of Brooklyn, offering thousands of public programs, millions of books, and access to more than 1,000 free Internet-accessible computers. The library wanted to ensure it was continuing to serve its patrons as effectively and efficiently as possible. CIO Selvon Smith wanted to gain fast, easily-understood access to his data, but the library\u2019s reliance on consultants and an outdated reporting system stood in the way. After discovering Tableau, Smith\u2019s team realized they could do far more than replace existing reports\u2014they could speed decisions, improve insight, and tell their stories to management and to their public in a visual, exciting way. Brooklyn Public Library is an independent system, separate from the New York and Queens libraries. \u201cWe do so much to touch the lives of people in Brooklyn,\u201d says Selvon Smith, CIO, Brooklyn Public Library. Smith and his team are driven to constantly improve the library\u2019s ability to meet its patrons\u2019 needs. But in order to do so, they needed better access to\u2014not to mention analysis of\u2014the metrics around various patron touch points. For example, the library used a PC and print management software application from Pharos Systems to manage many functions such as PC reservations and patron fine processing. Because the library was not a typical use case for the Pharos software, none the application\u2019s preconfigured reports met BPL\u2019s needs. Instead, BPL required the help of consultants to take on the work of extracting and manipulating the data. \u201cWe had four consultants looking after the whole Pharos PC and Print Management system, and also producing reports in Crystal Reports,\u201d remembers Nissa Wibecan, a Systems Administrator at Brooklyn Public Library. Analyzing the data in these Crystal Reports was exceedingly difficult, Wibecan recalls. She regularly spent a full two weeks each month working to produce regular patron resource and kiosk activity reports, for example. Because accessing data was so time-consuming and painful, Smith\u2019s team had to be very strategic about what questions they tried to answer using data. For example, BPL charges small fines for late, lost, or damaged material. Balancing patron accounts across the hundreds of thousands of library card holders to accrue or pay a fine each month was extremely challenging. As a result of these challenges, the BPL was not as data-driven as Smith\u2019s team would have liked. \u201cIn the past, the answer you might get could depend on who was generated the report and the parameters they used. So you might ask one person and get one answer\u2014but if you asked someone else, they\u2019d give you another number,\u201d he says. Wibecan agrees, saying \u201cBecause the numbers could vary depending on the method of generating them, there was less reliance on numbers to make decisions. We did the reporting, but it didn\u2019t necessarily drive how we ran the business of the library.\u201d Smith quickly realized that his team could use Tableau to do far more than simply replace Crystal Reports using Pharos data. \u201cWe started to understand what the product can bring\u2014we understood that we could do something with it outside of the Pharos environment, which is where we got buy-in from senior management,\u201d says Smith. Today, the library connects to a Microsoft SQL Server data warehouse using Tableau. The warehouse stores data from a variety of different data sources. The team also uses Tableau to blend data from SQL Server and Excel. Part of the new direction for Smith\u2019s team came with the creation of a new Strategic Planning Office, which included implementation lead and Project Manager for Strategic Initiatives, Diana Plunkett, ending an annual contract for organization performance management analysis, ending a service provider contract to analyze financial transactions, and training one staff member to transition from administrative duties to an analyst role. Today, the library has fifteen employees using Tableau Desktop to author dashboards. The library has invested in Tableau Server for publishing and sharing the interactive visualizations. Some employees of the library are taking advantage of subscriptions in Tableau Server to receive updated dashboards directly to their email inboxes. The library is also using Tableau Public for some of its public-facing data visualizations. The team is looking at a wide variety of data sources to help identify opportunities to improve the library\u2019s service to its patrons. For example, Plunkett has put together a usage rate visualization to analyze the demographic information and library usage patterns of a selection of its most prolific patrons. \u201cIt was visually compelling. And we could look on one page and learn quite a lot about who the patrons are, which branches they were using, what age they were, and that helped us make some decisions,\u201d says Plunkett. Wibecan notes, \u201cBefore we wouldn't even have been able to analyze it because there were too many data points, huge spreadsheets.\u201d Library management is using this information to support business decisions and assist with development planning. In another example, Smith has begun tracking PC sessions per month and he has noticed that WiFi user sessions increase each month\u2014in fact, the WiFi sessions are outpacing PC station usage. \u201cI can look and see that very quickly,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIn the past, I would have received this information via an Excel spreadsheet with just numbers. I\u2019m sure I would have missed the trend. I might have assumed WiFi was going up, but viewing it really tells the story.\u201d \u201cI think that what helped with the broader adoption in our organization\u2014which is ongoing\u2014was a sense of \u2018build it and they'll come,\u2019\" says Smith. The library has noticed many benefits since deploying Tableau, including: \u201cDrawing the data out from the various systems that the library uses to run its business was painful,\u201d says Wibecan. \u201cPart of the joy of moving to Tableau is that we are getting everything into a single solution and we can then slice and dice the data in different ways that weren\u2019t possible before.\u201d Plunkett says that that \u201cone of the most satisfying things\u201d is when another library employee will approach her with a Tableau success story. \u201cSomeone came up to me recently and said they learned about how world languages were circulating in their branch, and as a result they have changed their book displays,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI\u2019ll have to look into that!\u201d says Smith with a laugh, before commenting that the new, more data-driven culture means that Wibecan\u2014and the rest of the team\u2014are busier than ever fulfilling new requests. \u201cI can safely say we reclaimed the value of the ten days Nissa spent working on the old reports,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe fact that Tableau is so flexible, it lets us ask a lot of great questions about our data very easily. That's critical,\u201d says Wibecan. \u201cIf someone wants to see a certain report broken out every ten days, for example, we just say, \u2018Sure. We can actually build that permanently into the report.\u2019 I can't overstate how difficult this is with the other system.\u201d The team also appreciates how quickly Tableau allows them to answer ad hoc reporting requests and how much time is saved by the fact that management can use Tableau to answer many questions on their own. Wibecan and Plunkett say there is one more benefit they, personally, are experiencing thanks to the library\u2019s adoption of Tableau: More enjoyment in their daily work. \u201cWhen you work with Tableau, it\u2019s fun,\u201d says Nissa. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t say that of any other report-writing product. Ever.\u201d Plunkett agrees, saying \u201cI tell everyone, \u2018If I need to do work in Tableau, I have to make sure I get everything else done first. Because once I dive in, I\u2019m not coming back out!\u201d"

In this video, EMEA Product Manager Fawad Asrar Qureshi discusses why \u201cit became quite apparent we had to work with\u201d Tableau.\u201d Find more information on Teradata here. Tableau: Have you worked on many joint solution deployments?\nFawad Asrar Qureshi, Product Manager, EMEA: I've worked with many customers on Tableau and Teradata deployments. So the thing that the customers point out as the biggest trait of Tableau is its intuitiveness. And the ease of use and how quickly I learn this tool and be up to speed and start to work on the data. So the only prerequisite as described by the customer is that you only need to know about what the data is, and Tableau will take care of the rest. Tableau: You\u2019re a big data expert\u2014what is important to understand about big data?\nQureshi: When you're talking about big data, big data type of data sources and big data type of projects, the idea is to fail quickly. So you want to test out as many ideas as possible. So if you want to figure out if there's a new insight you want to find in the data, that's a hard thing to do if you don't have a data visualization tool which can answer your questions quickly communicating with the underlying data platform. And Tableau's ability is to provide visual analytics at the speed of thought works with the underlying platforms and it pushes all the queries down to the underlying system. So in that way the data processing is taken care of by the Teradata platforms and the visualization piece is taken care of by Tableau. And in this way they perfectly complement each other since they are the best in their respective areas. So it is very, very complementing and is a powerful offering for the customers. So Tableau as a partner, yeah, it is a very dynamic company to work with. Tableau: How does Tableau fit into Teradata\u2019s overall strategy?\nQureshi: Teradata has a best of breed strategy. So we will work with the best solutions in each and every domain. And we give the customers the option of picking the right tool. And it's not just compatibility or just making sure they work. It's really engineering level certification, so, you know, where the engineering teams sit together and work on a joint roadmap and to make sure that, you know, the joint offer delivers maximum value to the end customers. It became quite apparent so that we had to work with them, and come up with a joint offer which delivers maximum value for our clients. Tableau: With what industries are you introducing Tableau?\nQureshi: Tableau and Teradata are being used in a number of different industries. So, you know, they range from telecoms, finance, retail, oil and gas, even government agencies. Without going into the specifics of the numbers, Teradata and Tableau have actually, you know, helped our clients in a number of ways. So it has reduced the time to delivery of projects, because the clients can actually move towards an agile approach of BI project deliveries and they are able to find new insights very, very quickly. Tableau: What kinds of data are you using?\nQureshi: With a unified data architecture we have three platforms. We have the Hadoop appliance, we have the AstraData distributed appliance, which runs MapReduce and SQL all in one engine. Then we have the Teradata data warehouse appliances, which we have been delivering for more than 30 years. So all these can store the data at massive scale and you can make use of the data through the use of different analytical tools. Tableau: Can you say anything else about how Teradata and Tableau work together?\nQureshi: These two technologies, Teradata and Tableau, complement each other very well. Teradata scales linearly and can store massive volumes of data while delivering consistent performance on the queries, whereas Tableau allows the business user to think about only the business problem at hand and keep querying the data as they would like it to be displayed. And this makes these two technologies very complementing to each other and delivering the maximum value for the end business users."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Operating in a highly competitive market, the University of Western Sydney (UWS) wanted to streamline its processes for collecting and analysing student feedback, as well as identify areas for opportunity. Working with Big Data\nMade up of nine schools spread across six campuses in the Greater Western Sydney region, the University\u2019s geography plays an important role in its marketing strategy. UWS wanted a tool that could help break down the market in order to identify opportunities around specific course offerings. The University also collects useful information on the quality of the student experience through student surveys conducted each semester. Additionally, to help plan for future courses, each school is responsible for producing reports on course performance. Due to an explosion in data and the limitations of static reporting, Neil Durrant, Director of Performance and Quality at the University of Western Sydney, decided to seek an alternative and user-friendly way of presenting reports and survey results back to the schools. \u201cSome of the data we\u2019ve being working with recently would be millions of rows. We would just email PDFs around from our data warehouse but as the data warehouse developed and we had a bigger data set to play with, the limitations became obvious,\u201d says Durrant. Sizing up the Options\nDurrant started seriously looking into different Business Intelligence (BI) tools after attending a training session by data visualisation guru Stephen Few in Sydney. \u201cStephen spoke about best practices for presenting data in a way that\u2019s easily accessible to people and one of the pieces of software that he demonstrated was Tableau.\u201d The UWS BI team further researched Tableau and alternative data visualisation solutions. \u201cThere\u2019s a group in America called the BI Scorecard who have a process that you go through for evaluating business intelligence tools. I used their spreadsheet and Tableau came up number one,\u201d says Durrant. Durrant said the team also looked into other software programs but were swayed by Tableau\u2019s easy-to-use design. \u201cWe were looking for a user-friendly tool to supplement our existing technology stack for static and more regular reporting,\u201d says Durrant. \u201cWe also looked at QlikView but it just seemed clunkier and more expensive.\u201d UWS decided to implement Tableau Desktop for authoring data visualisations and Tableau Server to easily and securely share the interactive visualisations. Without any formal Tableau training Durrant was able to quickly pick-up the program through trial and error. \u201cI just started playing around with Tableau using Excel based information and found it was very easy to use. Things that would have taken our team of analysts three or four weeks to develop, I was able to do in a matter of days.\u201d Moving towards a more interactive online experience\nFrom a development point of view Durrant says, \u201cTableau is hands down unbeatable. I gave Tableau Desktop to our analysts and they just couldn\u2019t believe how easy it was to do things. Joining columns in data sets that have a long list of data points in each column would have previously taken a week to put together. Now we can do this in 20 seconds flat.\u201d Since rolling out Tableau to an initial 100 individual users, the feedback and results have been overwhelmingly positive at UWS. \u201cWe share the links to the dashboards we\u2019ve developed on Tableau Server and all the users have to do is click on them and away they go!\u201d says Durrant. \u201cPeople have enjoyed the experience.\u201d UWS is taking advantage of the mobile features available in Tableau 8. \u201cMany of our academic staff and students have iPads so we design everything in Tableau to fit on a tablet.\u201d UWS uses Tableau in combination with IBM\u2019s Text Analytics, to provide an integrated reporting platform for its student surveys. This allows each head of school to view both the quantitative and qualitative results alongside each other. \u201cThe process for reviewing course performance has moved from a static annually produced spreadsheet to an interactive and continuous experience with Tableau; so that\u2019s been very successful,\u201d says Durrant. Mapping the Market\nIn addition, Durrant says Tableau is fundamental to a new tool that is being used by UWS to analyse student demand for different course offerings. \u201cWe have six campuses spread across one area of Sydney, so we\u2019ve developed an analytical tool which allows people to gather evidence in terms of potential growth for their courses on particular campuses, as well as evidence for developing a new course and for moving an existing course onto a new campus.\u201d The analytical tool features six Tableau dashboards, three of which integrate UWS\u2019s in-house GIS mapping system with Tableau\u2019s map feature. UWS is currently rolling out the tool to the executive management of each school for course planning. \u201cIt\u2019s been really successful so far. It\u2019s a level of information that the University has never had access to previously,\u201d says Durrant. \u201cIt\u2019s taken about 12 months to build the database that underlies it and it is made up of millions of rows of numbers but with Tableau we\u2019ve managed to present it in a way that\u2019s immediately accessible.\u201d Four Weeks of Work Only One Click Away\nAs well as gaining informative market insights, UWS is able to save valuable administration time and people costs by using Tableau. \u201cUsing the annual course reports as an example, it would have taken the schools three or four weeks to have the data available to write the annual course report,\u201d says Durrant. \u201cNow it takes them a click\u2014one second! An analyst spends four weeks putting it all together but a month of one person\u2019s time is a lot better than a month of 18 people\u2019s time.\u201d The team at UWS has seen other improvements in survey analysis that they attribute to insights gained using Tableau. \u201cPreviously the Chair of our Student Experience and Engagement Committee would have spent three or four days wading through the printout of all the students\u2019 comments before analysing the key features and themes on their own,\u201d says Durrant. \u201cWhereas now Text Analytics does all the analytical work and Tableau presents it in a way that\u2019s easy to access in a half hour.\u201d Improving Access to Information\nTableau has enabled access to student feedback that previously was only accessible to a few people in the university, due to the size of the data. \u201cWe now send a dashboard to the whole committee and they are able to use it to come up with their own analysis,\u201d says Durrant. \u201cPreviously this information, once collected, would just gather dust in the data warehouse. Now it\u2019s become an integral part of closing the loop with our students.\u201d Prior to working with Tableau, Durrant says initial course planning was done in the dark. \u201cNow with Tableau we\u2019re actually able to make the evidence available to key decision makers,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re starting from a more informed place which means you save a lot of time and it promotes creativity because people can see things that they wouldn\u2019t have been able to see before. Before Tableau, we would have been reliant on one analyst in the whole university whereas now we can get a whole bunch of people around a table, look at the evidence and come up with ideas together.\u201d Where to Next?\nDurrant says that UWS is already planning a number of projects that will see upwards of a thousand users accessing Tableau. \u201cThe big goal for the coming year is to have a portal solution where we can provide school management with one set of data that combines human resource and course performance data,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the visualisations and reporting dashboards will be done using Tableau.\u201d \u201cThe big advantage of Tableau is being able to interact with your data, being able to see it in a way that is easy to interpret,\u201d says Durrant. \u201cThat, to me, is the best asset that Tableau brings.\u201d"

With Tableau I can show it to them directly and say, \"Here, look at this.\" In 5 minutes, I have a graphic he can understand, and even if that's only ever the first step, once he's taken that step, he's then embarked on a long journey with Tableau. Tableau: Can you tell us how you\u2019re using Tableau with clients?\nRalf: We've been using Tableau for almost a year and we've had the product and the application for almost a year at SOTEC. In our main project we're talking about over 500GB of data that we process. It's a shop, a retail shop, and they are purchasing documents in there and we're talking about over a billion documents, so a billion bills. If we were to visualize the whole thing\u2014every bill is about a tenth of a millimeter thick\u2014that would make a pile 100km high. Tableau has made it possible for us to prepare the data in such a way that we can say to the client, \"Look at this, you've now got a story that runs right through from the emergence of your data to the analysis of your data.\" In other words, without Tableau it would be much more difficult for us to show the client, to make it clear to the client, where the added value is. Tableau: Do you also blend disparate data with Tableau?\nRalf: It is also possible to combine data from different sources. We either do that when we're already dealing with very large data volumes beforehand, so that the different data sources are stored in the database, but with smaller operating data volumes, you can very easily prepare those using Tableau, and incorporate them \u2013 they are automatically linked, so that on the one hand you have these 500GB of data, but then where the shops are and how many inhabitants the town has, we would put that in context, in a simple little Excel table, which is somewhere on the computer. Tableau: Are you enjoying faster insight today?\nRalf: Nowadays nobody wants to and nobody can wait half a day for a report. And the speed with which the data is analysed, so the speed with which a dashboard is constructed, even on these 500GB of data, it only takes seconds \u2014that means no more hours of waiting. And the extreme or the big advantage: Previously if I wanted to make a small change to my question I gave it to IT and three weeks later they came back to me and said, OK, your report's ready. And now I can input the changes myself directly, activate them and let them run and I see my result within minutes. It's an evolutionary phase we're going through, and it's very, very important and useful. Tableau: One last question\u2014how did the availability of our hosted solution, Tableau Cloud, impact your decision to choose Tableau?\nRalf: A big advantage of Tableau is, for example, that I can use it online, that nowadays I don't need to construct my own server structure anymore \u2013 I can concentrate on my core business. I know I'm recording the data, they're stored in the Cloud and I also have Tableau as a solution, I can access it and I know it's available."

        "content": "TNP2K was established by Presidential decree in 2010 as part of a national team to alleviate poverty in Indonesia. TNP2K\u2019s main tasks are to develop poverty reduction policies and programs, as well as, coordinate poverty alleviation initiatives among the national and state authorities. To help the government officials and policy makers better manage and track poverty alleviation programs, TNP2K regularly analyzes over seven terabytes of data from various sources and in different formats, and present their findings in dashboard reports. With Tableau Software\u2019s easy-to-use interface and rapid-fire data analytic capabilities, TNP2K has been able to easily and quickly gain insights into the data and generate useful visualizations for its audience. One of TNP2K\u2019s main functions is to help the government ministries, public sector departments and agencies coordinate poverty relief programs. These programs are divided into the family-based cluster, the community-based cluster, and the small- and medium-enterprise cluster. Clusters cater to different aspects of the community; the programs for food and education are estimated to make up 40 percent of the needs across the sectors. TNP2K had to effectively process and gain insights into a large amount of data\u2014often over seven terabytes or more than 100 million rows in quantity\u2014and generate reports and visualizations that can help policy makers better manage and track the poverty alleviation programs. As a coordinator, TNP2K sees a wide variety of data from sources like statutory boards, regional governments and educational institutions and many others. Because the data are provided in various formats\u2014including SQL, text files, and Excel spreadsheets\u2014the team needed a tool that could help them make sense of the large amounts of disordered data. \u201cOne major problem that we faced when using the previous analytic system was size limitations,\u201d said Yugo Guotomo, Business Analyst, TNP2K. \u201cWe needed a system that was able to handle the large amount of data effectively.\u201d The TNP2K team also wanted a data analytics tool that was easy to use so that they could have it up and running as soon as possible without investing too much time on design, implementation and training. \u201cIt was extremely important that we have access to a tool that allows us to submit queries without much effort as not everyone on the team has an IT background,\u201d said Wahyono Kuntohadi, Integrated MIS Manager, TNP2K. Additionally, TNP2K analysts routinely face tight deadlines as the data required to generate reports often comes in late. This makes analysis using traditional analytics tools close to impossible. The TNP2K team came across Tableau about three years ago. They found that Tableau can be deployed quickly and is able to manage large amounts of data. The team also saw that Tableau allows users to rapidly analyze data and generate impressive reports. The team liked Tableau\u2019s easy visual interfaces, flexible configurations, and simple administration. \u201cTableau presents the information in easy-to-understand charts and graphs that clearly show the geographical regions that require aid and areas where the programs are succeeding,\u201d commented Wahyono. The TNP2K team also found Tableau to be comparably affordable as it provides end-user freedom in an environment that takes advantage of existing IT infrastructure. TNP2K now taps on Tableau\u2019s powerful analytical capabilities to efficiently interpret data and generate reports that help policy makers design programs such as rice rationing, to tackle poverty problems across the country. \u201cWe needed to ensure that our teams are able to focus on preparing the data effectively, without the need for scripting or coding. This way, we will not impose further burdens on our teams,\u201d Yugo explained. TNP2K is also able to use Tableau\u2019s to deliver results fast. Yugo elaborated: \u201cWithout Tableau, generating reports on time would be very difficult. For example, we need to generate reports on the Rice Ration Program (Beras Miskin \u2013 Raskin) every three months. However, the data is collected only a week prior to the deadline, this includes the challenge of interpreting data from various different formats. With Tableau, we are able to complete the analysis in the timespan of four days to a week. We only need to upload the data into the system and the reports are generated very quickly.\u201d TNP2K also adopted Tableau Server so teams can access data from the various government agencies easily and effectively. After analysts create interactive dashboards in Tableau Desktop, they can publish them to Tableau Server. The audience can view these published dashboards on a web browser or over a mobile device. With Tableau Server, TNP2K can publish their reports in real time to target audiences across the country. Government officials and policy makers are able to access the TNP2K reports online and better understand the effectiveness of their programs. \u201cTableau helps us to facilitate requests for intra-ministry data. The software has been instrumental in changing the mindset of many key decision makers in the ministries. It has helped to encourage ministries to maximize their data potential, both in context and content,\u201d commented Wahyono. According to Yugo, Tableau scores high on user satisfaction and adaptability within his organization. He said his IT staff is now happier, and end users especially like the software\u2019s ease of use and fast speed. In fact, Tableau has been so effective that he has had employees outside of the analysis team requesting for Tableau training."

Today, Tableau is helping PharmaSecure adopt an insight-driven customer service strategy that has helped the company: Creating a Data-Centric Value System for Customers\nPharmaSecure is a US-based software and technology company working towards improving global public health. Its offerings encapsulate a range of solutions that work towards eliminating counterfeit drugs, connecting patients with safe medicines, and impacting patient adherence. The company works with pharmaceutical companies to print unique, randomly generated codes on medicine packages. These identification codes serve two purposes: First, they allow manufacturers to track each strip or blister pack and shipping carton they produce. Second, patients can verify the authenticity of their medicine through SMS, mobile app or by feeding it on the company website. As part of this verification process, PharmaSecure enables access to a mobile health platform, allowing users to opt in to customized mobile heath programs. These programs have applications such as reminders to refill medicines, dosage checks, providing health tips etc. By creating this valuable ecosystem, PharmaSecure acts a facilitating link adding immense value to healthcare users and drug manufacturers. Recognizing an Opportunity\nWith the industry-wide transformation in the way healthcare is obtained, delivered and paid for, pharmaceutical companies are scouting for tools that can help them decode patients\u2019 behaviour and consumption patterns. In the context of this trend, PharmaSecure wanted to gain insights from its growing data repository to help strengthen their partnerships with pharmaceutical customers while helping patients manage their diseases better. \u201cData is at the corner stone of our business and we needed to make that our differentiating element. As a company, our data volumes, client portfolio and maturity had undergone an evolutionary curve and it was time for us to use an effective solution that could generate definable, powerful and intuitive analytics,\u201d says Samit YADAV, Senior Director, Technology and Operations, PharmaSecure. At first, the team analysed its data through a cumbersome and inefficient process. Team members would dedicate time every week to extracting information from different sources, populating Excel sheets with the data and finally, deriving graphs to visually represent the findings. To address this challenge, the company wanted an analysis solution that would offer a faster, interactive experience. Using the Power of Simplicity for Powerful Analytics\nAfter a careful evaluation of the players in the visual analytics marketscape, in 2013 PharmaSecure chose Tableau software due to its polished and comprehensive offering. Today Tableau software is used by most members of PharmaSecure\u2019s Operations team. Typically, PharmaSecure\u2019s MySQL and Excel data sources generate transactional databases of 200-500 rows a day, slated to reach 1000-2000 rows over the next six months. Throughout the span of 18 months that the company has used Tableau, they are gaining value by drawing insights from an ever increasing quantum of data. Today all internal reports are generated on Tableau with insights extracted from data every week and every month. This move to a prescriptive style of analytics triggers faster decision making for the company. Believing in Data Analytics and Its Influence\nUsing Tableau, the company has been able to maximise the value from their growing data without having to invest any additional resources. \u201cTableau\u2019s power lies in its simplicity and intuitiveness. Putting Tableau over our data integration layer, has given us substantially greater insight across the business operations- supply chain, time to market, program enrollment, distribution, sales force effectiveness among other aspects,\u201d Abhijit elaborates. Going forward, PharmaSecure will also start Tableau deployment with its customers whereby they will be able to not only access but build Tableau data charts on their own. \u201cThe biggest highlight of using Tableau has been that our entire team now truly believes in the power of insightful data. Thanks to Tableau, we as an organisation have become a lot more excited about using data in impactful and interesting ways for our customers.\u201d"

        "content": "Helping businesses navigate the world of IT is Schneider & Wulf\u2019s sole focus. Watch this video to hear what Schneider & Wulf CRM consultant Christian Sommer has to say about his experience as a Tableau partner. (Video in German) Tableau: Was there an \u201caha moment\u201d for you with Tableau?\nChristian Sommer, CRM Consultant: The first \u201cA-ha!\u201d effect for me with Tableau was actually as soon as I started working with it. Basically, when we decided to evaluate Tableau, my colleague gave me access to the software with a 30-day key, along with a selection of training videos etc., and said: \"Watch these videos and then have a look at rebuilding our individual solution. Well, then after the first day he came in and asked which videos I'd watched and I replied, none, because I'd been having a go with the software. After two days I gave him the same answer and after two and a half days I still hadn't watched one video, but I'd already got the solution about 80 - 90% complete, because Tableau is just so intuitive that I didn't need any further instructions. Tableau: What is the biggest benefit of Tableau? Sommer: I think it just helps us to make much quicker and much better decisions with the data we already have available and thereby to lay the foundations for our business differently, simply because we can analyse or view things which we wouldn't have known about without Tableau. I'd say that you can go to completely new levels of questions and answers incredibly quickly, where sometimes you didn't even think to ask questions like that before because you didn't know there was an answer to them. Tableau: Can you describe what it\u2019s like to use Tableau?\nSommer: I'd say first of all that I find it incredibly fun working with Tableau. I think if we asked my wife she'd say that since I've had Tableau I definitely spend too much time at the computer. Not because I have to and not because I wouldn't be quick enough with Tableau, but because it's just so much fun and I don't want to stop. Tableau: How did you end up choosing Tableau?\nSommer: Well, since 2011 we've been evaluating various BI solutions, always with a view to implementing quick and cost-effective solutions with small and medium-sized companies. The reason we've just kept looking until now\u2014and only started using Tableau in March\u2014is that we didn't discover Tableau sooner. With the other solutions we evaluated, we came across implementation processes which were simply far too long. I mean, we did find licensing models which would definitely have been suitable for the model we have in mind, but it was just incredibly labour-intensive to process any solutions using them. And with Tableau we had exactly the opposite experience\u2014 that we were able to produce very good results within a very short space of time. And that tipped the balance in favour of Tableau. Tableau: What kind of data do you work with?\nSommer: Well, the data we work with is mainly SQL Server data, mainly Microsoft, Oracle. High Space plays a minor role - and apart from that we sometimes also get something via a Flat File, but those tend to be the exceptions. The data volumes are very varied, so from 100 customer data records to thousands or even millions of transaction data records, depending on what's being assessed. So for things like analyses on resubmissions from vendors to customers and things like that I obviously have to scan entire appointment calendars, and then I inevitably end up with large quantities of data, whereas when I have clients who only have a limited customer base themselves and I want to analyse something purely at client level, then I have a very limited amount of data. Tableau: And what was your job like before Tableau?\nSommer: Previously, with our individual solution, we took a completely different approach which focused on collecting all the data initially, which meant we had very long start times, but we also had very quick response times while we were working with the solution. With the disadvantage that the data wasn't updated in real time. Instead I always had to make sure I refreshed it, and again that took a long time, because everything was buffered. Now with Tableau these waiting times are much shorter, because only the data I want to display at that moment is read. And I have the enormous advantage of always\nbeing able to work with live data and not having to constantly refresh the view. Tableau: How would you describe Tableau as a partner?\nSommer: About the Tableau company, first of all I'd say that I get the feeling it's a very open-minded business and you can make contacts incredibly quickly and also, through those contacts, you can get the information you need."

        "content": "Far EasTone Telecommunications is a leading telecommunication and digital application services provider in Taiwan. Established in 1997, FET currently employs more than 5,000 people. The company, which is well known for its innovation and adoption of cutting-edge technologies, serves both consumers and enterprise customers offering 2, 3, and 4G services, Wi-Fi and Wi-Max connection, as well as enterprise cloud services targeted at the business community. FET recently adopted the rapid-fire business intelligence software Tableau to provide business users with fast and easy visual analytics. The company\u2019s information technology (IT) department not only deployed the software to various business units, but also took on a consulting role to guide business users to the full potential of this dynamic visual analytic tool. In addition to using Tableau with internal data, Bruce Hsiao visualizes publicly available data using Tableau Public. Taiwan has one of the most advanced telecommunication infrastructures in the Asia Pacific region. A high-technology center well known for its computer products, Taiwan has an extremely high mobile penetration rate of 125 percent and robust fixed-line telephone sector with 55 percent penetration. Its modern telecommunication network also features high broadband accessibility and lightning fast Internet connection speed. Far EasTone Telecommunications (FET) is one of the leading service providers operating in the competitive Taiwan telecommunication market. The company needs to continue to innovate and leverage technologies to keep ahead of the competition, and one of the ways it does this is through the use of big data. FET staff used to have to raise a service request with the information technology (IT) department when they need to generate reports tapping on the data stored in the company\u2019s data warehouse. They would indicate what data or information was required, and IT would extract the right datasets from the data warehouse\u2014which has about 20 terabytes worth of data\u2014using a programming language. IT would then deliver the findings in text files, and data analysis was usually done using simple spreadsheet software. According to Bruce Hsiao, Manager of Information Technology, Data Warehouse & Business Intelligence at FET, the indirect approach of working through IT for any data access was tedious and time consuming. Although the company\u2019s management was aware of the need for more business user \u2018self service\u2019, most of the users were not equipped with the programming skills required to access data directly. Bruce, and his team of 16 data intelligence engineers including 3 dedicated Tableau experts, spent the last two years systematically deploying Tableau across FET. There are now 50 active Tableau users who use Tableau every day. Approximately 200 more access Tableau Server to view and interact with the reports using an Internet browser. Tableau is now used in FET\u2019s Call Center, Finance, Sales and Marketing, and other departments. Call Center staff uses the software to track call frequency and quality. It is used for financial analysis such as revenue and cost measurement in Finance. Sales and Marketing teams keep track of the performance of over 1,000 retail outlets and about 2,000 frontline staff with the software, generating performance reports for sales planning. Marketing uses it to gain insights into subscriber behavior, market trends, etc. to better understand customer preferences. The success of the Tableau roll-out was not achieved overnight. Bruce\u2019s team conducted more than 150 roadshows at various FET offices across Taiwan to help users familiarize with the software. This was an in-depth program that involved hands-on training and workshops. To date, about 500 users have gone through the training. \u201cIT departments need to drive Tableau implementation to make it successful in an enterprise environment,\u201d commented Bruce, who oversees big data and data intelligence adoption at FET. \u201cIT needs to play an internal consultant role to make the deployment successful, and not just install the software and leave it to users to figure it out,\u201d he continued. Bruce added that it is important that IT be available when users need help. Instead of attending to analytics requests and generating reports, his team has now put the power of business intelligence into the hands of the business users. The team also mans an internal helpdesk so that users can reach them when they run into obstacles using the software. Bruce explained that datasets from the data warehouse are now available for data analysis in Tableau. The team regularly uses Tableau to access and analyze data stored in the data warehouse. One of the largest datasets that they have worked with had almost 500 million rows. He believes that Tableau has brought incredible time savings to business users at FET. \u201cTime from data to insights has dramatically shortened by about 50 to 60 percent using Tableau,\u201d explained Bruce. \u201cBesides this, much of the savings is also in how users are presenting their reports in a visual business dashboard format that offers great interactivity. Users can now act on additional queries immediately and find new answers on the interactive dashboards in real-time, instead of going back to the datasets and generating a new report, which can mean making a new request with IT, like in the past.\u201d According to Bruce, users at FET are especially pleased with Tableau\u2019s performance when responding to large amount of data. They also really appreciate how Tableau\u2019s data blending capabilities allows them to easily work with data from multiples sources. Additionally, users like how Tableau allows for the grouping of data, or combining several dimension members into a single member\u2014which is very effective for grouping various data into a higher level category. Tableau users at FET have also begun sharing reports on dashboards via Tableau Server. This allows authorized users to access and interact with information on the dashboards anytime, anywhere using mobile devices such as tablets."

It was a lot of work and the 'pain' kept increasing, so we wanted to bring in a professional solution. We did an evaluation of various providers and Tableau was the best-performing. Tableau: What has your experience been with Tableau?\nChristian Hoffmann: We're very happy with it, because the majority of users have direct online access to all the reporting they need. Tableau: What\u2019s one area in which you\u2019ve used Tableau?\nChristian: One very important criterion in development was that we were also able to visualise this geographical data somehow\u2014and actually, on that score, it really just blew us away. It just blew the other candidates out of the water. Tableau: Did you consider cost as part of your decision?\nChristian: We felt that in the long term we would be able to achieve the lowest costs with Tableau. Tableau: How did Tableau evolve or spread at your company?\nChristian: We started off with Marketing. That was also where the sponsor for the project was. But since then other departments have also started using Tableau. So we started by analysing the CRM data in particular using Tableau\u2014and that's around 100,000 client details, stakeholders, and prospects\u2014and we're also now looking into offering access to the finance data, etc. And another thing we often do is data quality reporting. With that you can see relatively easily if any inconsistent data has been entered, and then correct it. Tableau: Would you say that you are more efficient now?\nChristian: I think with the possibility for rapid visualisation and implementation and prototyping that there are completely new possibilities in terms of reacting quickly to changes. And If Tableau didn't exist, we'd definitely have a problem, because then I wouldn't be here - I'd be busy producing reports, doing that manual work which is no longer necessary, we've cut down on that a great deal. Tableau: One last question! Do you ever blend data from multiple data sources into a single visualization?\nChristian: We blend data, mainly because we tend to also have planning data that only exists in Excel and we then blend that together with the real actual numbers. We now have a lot more ways to prepare automated reports as well\u2014and I think the fact that we can do that now is definitely a difference we've seen compared with the past."

But what we were missing was one tool would allow us to run analyses of all the data. We needed an analysis tool\u2014we\u2019ve now found Tableau for this task. Immediately after I saw it, I ordered the first license and it was clear that we were going to stick with Tableau for data analysis. Tableau: What do you like best about using Tableau? Thomas: It's remarkable that it can handle such complex data structures so intuitively and flexibly. Every time I use it I get excited by it again. You don\u2019t need to think so much about what sort of analysis you\u2019re creating, because it\u2019s just so flexible. For me it\u2019s less a reporting tool that I use to provide finished results in one form or another, it's more a thinking aid\u2014the program thinks along with the user. In discussions, you can take ideas that previously you could only come up with based on vague ideas or gut feelings, and implement them with the support of IT systems and on the basis of correct data. Tableau: How does your team use Tableau on a day-to-day basis?\nThomas: In addition to a lot of so-called \u201csmall\u201d analyses when you can simply use it instead of Excel, a large area of application for us is the complete cost accounting calculations, which we export from the ERP systems into Tableau. We have them in detail in the ERP system and we present this overall view of all order types, product groups, regions etc. in Tableau. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted your company as a whole?\nThomas: It\u2019s nice to have data\u2014but if you can\u2019t generate it meaningfully and, hopefully, draw the right conclusions from it, you don\u2019t benefit much. Tableau is a significant factor in our ability to remain relevant and productive in the future. Tableau: Did you consider other business intelligence solutions?\nThomas: I looked at many, many programs and we often thought about going for a competitor's product. But we could never bring ourselves to do it because it was never a 360-degree solution for us. Then we downloaded the trial version and in just a few hours we received the first analyses\u2014analyses that previously we would either have not created at all or only created with considerable effort. Tableau: Is there anything else you could share about your experience with Tableau?\nThomas: As I said, it\u2019s remarkable how flexibly you can handle large quantities of data. You just enjoy working with your data and you\u2019re always trying to find new information in the data pool. Of course, it\u2019s important and necessary at work, but you find yourself enjoying tinkering with it in your free time, to discover the limits of the tool's possibilities."

        "content": "Tableau: What\u2019s the key to handling big data?\nChris Selland, Vice President of Marketing and Business Development: What's really going to make big data go mainstream is the ability to connect not just with data scientists and technologists but business people, and absolutely one of the keys to that is visualization, is being able to show people, not just tell people, not just show numbers or even show charts but to have those charts and graphs and visualizations come alive. And it's really so, so, so important for big data really becoming not just a technical term but a business term, which is exactly where we're going now, and for organizations as we get into this future where analytics is going to be the key to competitiveness. Tableau: How does Tableau help?\nSelland: So, you know, Tableau is obviously very much at the forefront of that wave, and the fact that our technologies work together so well that the power of our platform really allows Tableau to really show its best performance and perform with the absolute highest performance and, you know, the products have really been well optimized. When we demonstrate Vertica, we are very, very commonly demonstrating Vertica behind Tableau. We're showing Tableau. It's funny, because oftentimes people say to us, \"Is that a Tableau demo?\" We'll say, well, it's both, because, you know, the fact that Tableau is performing so well and going so quickly, that's really our product helping in the background. So but it's a great partnership, and as I said, the future is I believe even brighter than it's already been So the ability that we have to kind of benefit from that, and like I said, not just show data in a static way but show data in a live, visual way where things move, where things flow, but yet even when you have these massive data volumes or ability to scale. So there's so much joint opportunity for us and visualization is so, so important to us. Tableau: Who\u2019s using Vertica?\nSelland: These days, Vertica finds itself used by organizations across a wide variety of industries anywhere there's very large volumes of data. As I often say, double, triple digit terabytes, petabytes of data, that's really Vertica's sweet spot as an organization and as a technology. Some of the industries that we serve, we have become very big in areas such as advertising technology, social networking. That's certainly a very big market for us, given the volume of data and some of the truly, you know, large social networking organizations. Companies like Facebook and Twitter are joint customers of ours. Telecommunications is a huge industry for us, financial services is a huge industry for us. In all those industries we've shared a wide variety and a large number of customers with Tableau. We've had so many high profile customer wins over the past few years, and so many high profile customers that we work in common with Tableau. This is certainly a partnership which if a customer says to us, well, you know, I\u2019m looking to use Vertica with Tableau, can you tell me who else is doing it, we - we have a large number of organizations we can show them. We've got a great, great breadth of joint customers and joint success that we've been able to bring to the market. Tableau: Why do Tableau and Vertica work together so well?\nSelland: I think the organizations' joint commitment to customer success as well is also what makes them successful in the long term. Our customers, particularly our joint customers, really benefit from first of all just this sort of shared history of how long Vertica and Tableau have worked together, how well our products work together, how well the organizations I think mesh, both from a technology standpoint and culturally, and just our track record of success. Tableau: Can you tell us about a particular success story?\nSelland: Last December at HP Discover we had Tim Campos, who is the CIO of Facebook, come and talk to an audience, pan-EMEA, really a worldwide audience if you include everybody who was watching online, about the power of Vertica and how Vertica has really transformed analytics inside of Facebook. That obviously is a customer that we're very, very proud of. We're very, very proud of our ability to help them sort of get to their goals, and it's also a customer that we share with Tableau. So we're really proud of that implementation. The video is actually live on HP.com where you can go see for yourself but that certainly is one that we count as a customer that we're really proud of, and a customer that we've worked with you with."

Visibility into customer and web analytics helps Allrecipes reach dominant audiences like millennials, establishing a competitive advantage in the digital landscape. The team also shares audience-specific insights with media and advertising partners to support advertising partnerships while maintaining a positive brand experience for the Allrecipes community. \u201cAt Allrecipes, it's actually easier to list out departments not using Tableau dashboards as compared to those that are. The dashboards are being used to inform nearly every business need,\u201d says Esmee Williams, VP of Consumer and Brand Strategy with a smile. Tableau licenses are spread across product, design, marketing, editorial, finance, business intelligence, consumer strategy, and more. \u201cEverybody here is taking a look at the data to help move this brand forward,\u201d says Esmee. \u201cMy team\u2019s focus is to energize and excite others about the Allrecipes brand\u2014and to help them better understand the wants and needs and food behaviors of our community of home cooks.\u201d The consumer and brand strategy team champions new features, partner integrations, along with customized marketing, editorial and promotional programs. To drive strategy, the team looks to the Allrecipes community for insights. With Tableau, they can understand community trends and behaviors and seamlessly respond to preferences. \u201cThe Allrecipes community is so amazing. It is based-on millions of shared experiences through reviews, recipes, photos, blog posts, that have resulted in the brand and community that we have today,\u201d says Esmee. With Tableau, Allrecipes never has to guess at what home cooks want or need. They use data to discover desires and then inform product development strategy and marketing campaigns with their findings. \u201cBeing able to access the data to see how our community responds really helps us foster tight alignment amongst the teams.\u201d With Tableau, data is now readily accessible across Allrecipes. Automatic updates keep the data fresh, so teams can take action on emerging trends. \u201cThe business impact from Tableau has been fantastic. It allows get our data out to internal audiences much faster in a way that is easily digestible to help them make more informed, strategic decisions,\u201d says Esmee. To share insights across teams, employees publish dashboards to Tableau Server, establishing one source of truth for company-wide data. \u201cWith Tableau, our teams can leverage reports no matter where they are. They can collaborate, whether it's at their desk, in meetings, or on the go,\u201d shares Esmee. \u201cTableau presents the data in a way that's very easily understandable so that folks can spend less time interpreting and more time acting on the data.\u201d \u201cNow we can share information across the company, which gives everybody the confidence to know that we're all working towards the same goals,\u201d explains Stan Paylovsky, President of Allrecipes. The Allrecipes websites receive a billion and a half visits each year. With Tableau, the marketing teams can understand customer behavior on the site, track the health of the business, and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs). \u201cKnowing how consumers interact with branded content is so essential,\u201d says Esmee. \u201cThe data shows us how home cooks interact with our products and experiences so we can continue to create new solutions to serve those needs. Tableau really helps them understand the context in which the product is used.\u201d Allrecipes brings in data from Adobe Marketing Cloud and demographic information from comScore and Hitwise into Tableau to create consumer behavior dashboards. \u201cWe don't have to guess what consumers are doing or what they want, we can see it through their daily behaviors, and we use that to inform everything that we do,\u201d shares Esmee. \u201cWe can look at how cooks are submitting and sharing content, and what sort of social sites they're pushing out their experiences. We look at food trends and what's the next, newest, best thing that folks are putting on their table.\u201d The marketing team uses these consumer insights to make tweaks to the website, improving the brand experience. \u201cAs a marketer, it\u2019s fantastic to be able to immediately see the responses and actions that consumers are taking based on changes or enhancements to the site. It helps us know when our actions are making a difference and gives us the confidence to determine next steps in our strategy.\u201d When Allrecipes opted to establish aggressively expand their video catalog across their site, YouTube and social channels, teams needed insights into what types of dishes they should focus on first for maximum results. Analyzing the data in Tableau, the Business Intelligence team determined dessert recipes\u2014a highly visual form of content\u2014resulted in more video views, user-contributed photos and comments. Renny explains, \u201cWe used that information create a special, more prominent destination for dessert videos. We found that that hub was widely used by our users, and it was a good way to organize our video library.\u201d Instead of relying on intuition, the Allrecipes team can build content experiences informed by data. This contributes to the success of the site and saves the company time and money. Allrecipes uses Tableau to uncover food trends, spot what\u2019s most popular and fastest moving on a daily basis, and observe daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly changes. \u201cTableau has definitely given us the opportunity to enhance audience development and increase revenues,\u201d says Stan. Esmee explains how this allows the team to understand new audiences like millennials: \u201cAn interesting food trend that we're seeing right now is driven by millennials\u2014a generation particularly focused on value. In a lot of ways, they're trying to stretch their food dollars. They're looking to the experiences of their grandmothers\u2014who were also presented with finding budget-friendly meals during the mid-century.\u201d \u201cTo give you an idea of what that looks like, if you look at our dashboards today we can see that recipes for meatloaf, pancakes, waffles, and chickens with dumplings are all trending. What\u2019s old is new again. And, of course, millennials put their own twist on everything. We've got amazing new recipe ideas for these dishes being published every day.\u201d With these audience insights, Allrecipes can segment audiences for each recipe type. This empowers them to deliver fresh, effective content faster than competitors. \u201cUnderstanding the data provides a high level of confidence that the direction we're heading with our vision, products, content and our services is spot on. To know improvement made will deliver a significant difference for our home cooks.\u201d Staying ahead of the digital landscape is crucial for a brand like Allrecipes. For both marketing and technology purposes, teams need insight into how the community interacts with recipe content across all devices. \u201cThere are so many new devices coming on the market every day. Tableau helps us understand how to share content with our home cooks across any device, whether he/she is planning, shopping, cooking or sharing,\u201d shares Esmee. \u201cMobile is the biggest change to our business in recent years. A few years ago, we had 8 percent of our audience coming in from mobile devices. Today, mobile accounts for more than three-fourths of all visits.\u201d Allrecipes aims to provide a continuous experience across devices. A typical Allrecipes user may plan their meal from a PC or laptop, use their mobile device to shop for ingredients at the grocery store, and then use their tablet or voice technologies to guide them through preparing the recipe in their kitchen at home. \u201cHaving access to the data with Tableau lets us understand each use case to serve a broad variety of needs in new and interesting ways,\u201d voices Esmee. \u201cIt makes a huge difference when we are able to optimize for each screen.\u201d Business Analyst, Renny Sabina describes how Tableau dashboards revealed insights into consumers\u2019 mobile behavior. The business intelligence team created an A/B test where they tested the Allrecipes mobile site on a tablet versus the desktop site. \u201cWe saw some positive interactions. For example, people were uploading photos more efficiently because they have a camera on their iPad and they don't have that functionality on a desktop.\u201d As a result of this testing, the team decided to optimize content for mobile, increasing user engagement. With Tableau, teams have fast access to consumer data, allowing them to react to trends and serve audiences with the content they want and need\u2014securing the loyalty of core audiences. Allrecipes collaborates with advertisers and media to enhance the site experience, leading to more effective advertising and as a result, stronger relationships with advertising partners. Using data, Allrecipes helps partners craft stories for their brands based on what\u2019s trending in the marketplace. \u201cOne of the coolest things that we've done with Tableau is create dashboards that help us share data to the media and advertisers, particularly around consumer trends during the biggest food holidays,\u201d recalls Esmee. For example, Allrecipes created a visualization in Tableau during the Thanksgiving holiday, allowing partners to understand what home cooks across the US were making for their Thanksgiving meals at a very granular level. \u201cWe look to create content marketing opportunities for brands that enhance the consumer experience. Sponsored opportunities such as editorially-rich, content-forward landing pages, shopper marketing local offers, social posts and live videos provide inspiration to home cooks while keeping leading brands top of mind as consumers plan their next grocery shopping trip. And so we provide brands the opportunity to connect with our audiences at the time of need in a way that is additive to the home cook experience. Tableau helps us understand how well we're doing towards that goal and how our ad products are performing.\u201d Through these dashboards, the team discovered nationwide popularity on some recipes along with geographical preferences for certain regions. \u201cThere are some certain dishes that are common across the United States, but when you look deeper into the data you can see very real geographical differences,\u201d explains Esmee. \u201cWhat a cook may call \u2018stuffing\u2019 in the northern states, is referred to as \u2018dressing\u2019 in the southeast, and whereas pecan pie is most popular say in Georgia, it's really about apple pie in Maine and Michigan.\u201d Both media and advertisers responded positively to these dashboards\u2014allowing them to reach millions of home cooks with engaging and tailored methods. \u201cWe were uniquely able to package and present data using Tableau that provided staff and partners a glimpse into tens of millions of American kitchens on the biggest food holiday of the year,\u201d says Esmee. \u201cWhich excited them and helped them to create and share stories with their own audiences.\u201d This helps Allrecipes grow advertising revenues while maintaining a positive customer experience for their active community\u2014creating a competitive advantage in the digital realm. \u201cTableau creates a really great competitive advantage for Allrecipes because it allows us to provide the partners that we work with access to this data, very quickly, and in a way that they can very easily digest. They are as excited about the data as we are. It also helps us innovate more rapidly.\u201d"

So our most power should come from information and knowledge. And that's where we need a lot of information.\nMathijs Van Niel, Policy Advisor: We've got all kind of datasets about housing, about traffic, and we make analysis from that. We also publish our dashboards in a BI portal so that the public and the inhabitants of the province, about 3.5 million people, can use the data as well.\nJesper: You have to think about housing problems, projecting future scenarios and development, the demographic development, and you have to project your economic analysis and your mobility analysis and all that into the mix, and provide people with the data to make their own decisions about those developments, and empower people with the right information. Tableau: What sort of challenges were you facing that made you consider Tableau?\nJesper: The more questions you get, the harder it becomes to manage all that. And then we needed a tool to, well, handle it.\nMathijs: I think there are a lot of possible uses for Tableau. There is a lot of data available, only nobody can use it. Tableau can be a very useful tool to make the data public in an easy way.\nJesper: We actually know what we want with the data, and it's available, but it's far from structured. It sometimes differs from province to province or how you will get the data. And then it's very good to see that you can combine all those things and then use Tableau to integrate it and make sense out of it all. I think now we have a platform that is both more interactive, but it's also giving us the option to make it in to the data much faster. So we have managed to get the work that we did in Excel, for example, get it into Tableau and make it more interactive for ourselves as the analysts, and for the end user. Tableau: Can you tell me a bit about your data?\nMathijs : It\u2019s SQL database, it\u2019s Excel, Access. Some Excel sheets are about 15 rows and three columns to big datasets about of the houses in the Netherlands \u2014 that's about millions of records.\nJesper: And you have all the geospatial formats like XML, GML files\u2026Our experience is mainly coming from the geospatial kind of analysis, which is quite complex and you need to know a lot about programs. We saw that even on geospatial analysis, Tableau could cover quite a bit of what we wanted actually. So that's - that was a surprise to us, I think.\nMathijs : A pleasant surprise. Tableau: How is sharing Tableau visualizations through your website going?\nJesper: Especially for those big datasets it's very useful \u2014 it's more powerful to present it with Tableau and put it on your website. We could make a relatively boring subject quite interesting while presenting it with Tableau. Tableau: Well, we love hearing that! How is that going? Is it fairly easy to embed and maintain?\nMathijs: It has a big\u2014a big impact. We made a website like this before, three years ago, and all of our graphics, graphs, maps, were all JPEGs. So we had to make the JPEGs, just put it on a website. It was a lot of work. And at this moment with Tableau, it's just embedded and you can change things in the dashboards and it changes on the real live page again. Tableau: Great! What are you doing with the time that you\u2019re saving? Jesper: We don't plan less time than before, but what we immediately do is when we see that it works faster, we add more. So in the same window of time we have been able to get much more information in. And that's because of the efficiency we get. People see that data can be interesting and lively, and that\u2014it's not a boring subject that you should do less and less of, but that you should invest in it. Tableau: What would you do if you didn\u2019t have Tableau?\nMathijs: If we didn\u2019t have Tableau\u2026\nJesper: We\u2019d search for another job!\nMathijs: Yeah, I think it would be so much less fun to do\u2014to be working on what we actually have to do now."

And, typically, we've been using it in a data discovery mode. So we've been learning things about our data, learning things about our business, and creating actionable insights off the back of that data. Tableau: What is working with Tableau like?\nDuncan: So in terms of our general experience with Tableau is \u2013 it's a really positive experience. Right from something as simple as installing the product right through to publishing on Tableau Public or publishing on Tableau Server\u2014all of these tasks have really been stripped down to make them as user-centric as possible, and something which allows us to focus on the real business issues and not become deep technologists. So what I enjoy most about working with Tableau is really the ease of creating new visualizations. The fact that you spend most of the time not on the data itself, but, rather, on what is the data telling me about the business problem that I'm looking to solve? Tableau: Can you give an example of when Tableau was helpful?\nDuncan: A lot of the things we're looking at are internal, confidential data that we can't share externally. So it's creating value for the organization. Obviously, that's happening behind the scenes, but at the same time, we can really focus on the business issues and allow the software to get out of the way and allow us to quickly develop the insights which we're looking for. So that's been my overall experience of Tableau and the reason why we continue to use it."

Tableau: How would you describe Arauco\u2019s experience with Tableau?\nLuis: The experience has been great, in the sense that we have been able to develop, without being experts, graphics, dashboards that are highly interactive, in a very short time. So, to that sense, it is a tool that does not compare with what we had before, to say the truth. Luis It allows us all to develop fast and to be able to publish and share information. It is super easy to connect to the data, from Excel\u2014which is what every company has\u2014to maybe, more complex things. Tableau: What is the benefit of that speed and ease?\nLuis: Today we have highly automatized things that looking back, I don't know, a year ago, were very hard to update. This means that the expectations of our business managers, for example of having a report with the profitability for one month could have been eight, nine days after the information was published. Today we are talking about something that updates within the same day and that is distributed to everyone. Thus, there are many minutes, many hours gained as an organization by having the information available and online and that everyone can have access to. And I haven't even started telling you about the maps that for a company as ours, which is global, and has different manufacturing sites, and several different places where it sells\u2014it is essential to be able to easily visualize your sales in a map. Your sales, your returns, your product, etc. Thus, all that sort of package makes the experience quite good and makes of Tableau a product that is quite complete. Tableau: What would you say to others who might be considering Tableau?\nLuis: Look, in terms of costs, when they, obviously, proposed the tool, but we also performed a brief investigation, and we found that it was by far the best alternative. So, in that sense, we found it to be very good\u2026 the relation from what I get to what I pay."

We have several hundreds of thousands of subscribers. Each of these every month generates transactions for billing, collections, customer care, and so on. So we generate about hundreds of millions of data records yearly. That's a lot of data. Tableau: How has Tableau performed with that quantity of data?\nJos\u00e9: Tableau has been able to handle all that data with no problem. So my first thought when we found out this capability of Tableau is it is fast, extremely fast and really efficient. We are now able to take a whole lot of data, millions of records, and do an analysis right away, quickly on our Tableau Desktop in a matter of hours. So on a daily basis we can now do a lot more analysis, more in depth analysis, because we have more time. Tableau: What was the process before Tableau?\nJos\u00e9: In the past, most of that time was spent doing queries, doing\u2014building datasets or maybe building data warehouses, conducting projects for developing dashboards with the traditional dashboarding tools and so on. Before, we had to abide by the traditional methods, we had queries in SQL, we had Excel, and we had to dedicate several days with several engineers in order to have one dashboard, produce a report and be able to respond to a specific question. Tableau: What is the impact of improving that process with Tableau?\nJos\u00e9: We are now far more efficient than before. We feel now that we are adding a lot more value to the business. Tableau has let us do real faster and more in depth, more profound analysis. So this has led to a better decision-making process in the company. So we have actually added value to the business. Tableau: Earlier, you mentioned SQL and Excel\u2014are you blending data from multiple sources?\nJos\u00e9: There is an important part of the information that does not come from those sources, that comes from external sources and that is contained in different data systems, such as Excel, flat files, or multiple database technologies. And Tableau has allowed us to integrate all these with the structured data we already had.\nThat saved us a great deal of work in data management and in the extraction and creation of structured databases to be able to make the dashboards."

        "content": "Tableau: And how did getting Tableau help?\nDavid Baudrez, Head of Business Insight for Cisco Commercial, EMEA: When we talk to the marketing team or when we talk with the engineering team or with the channel operation team, they are interested by data but, from their context. It was pretty difficult for them to have an analystic view on all those data points, because all those data were existing well but all in silo. Thanks to Tableau, we have been really able to change the game there, and to offer answers, to anticipate questions that those guys may have. Prior to Tableau, we were relying on Excel reports and thousands of them that were produced by our BI, traditional BI teams, and the problem was when you are in the field you do not have time to crunch Excel, you do not have time to look at the data and do everything yourself. You just need answer to your question. Tableau: How has Tableau helped managers at Cisco?\nDavid: For the audiences, which is the account managers, the SEs and the channel account manager that we are supporting, which is our primary audience, it was really a game-changer. So those guys do not have time and do not necessarily like to consume data. They do not have time usually in their day. But looking at data and identifying the patterns of a graphic has really helped them to understand the story, to understand what's going on, and to understand what the action they have to take in order to make a difference and create a business impact. We totally fell in love with Tableau and the promises that you have to offer actionable, readily available data that everybody can consume, not only the analyst and the power users, but everybody in an organization. Tableau: In a wider sense, how does Cisco use Tableau to understand data?\nDavid: What we have been doing, first through this data federation, data virtualization environment, is connecting all the dots together and then thanks to Tableau we are able to extract the value out of that. We have quite a lot of data available with Cisco. One of the problems is that all those data are there but in silo. And one of the first challenges is really to connect the different data silos together in order to have this federation layer and be able to keep the data transversally, like I was mentioning, and extract let's say business insight from those different silos of data. Tableau: Has Tableau helped you to be more productive in your work?\nDavid: In terms of productivity savings, we see productivity increase at multiple levels. Now the power users and let's say the subject matter expert, they can save about a couple hours a week, which is very impressive. Now, what\u2019s most interesting is really the productivity we are saving at the field level, so the thousands of people we are serving. And from a couple of surveys that we have run, we estimate that they can save about one to two hours a week, which is very impressive if you multiply it by 1,000 and then you can really see the benefit of all that. Tableau: How has understanding your data affected your decision making?\nDavid: More data-driven decisions is really the purpose of what we do, right? We are looking at doing it bottom up, doing things bottom up in my team, and the collateral effect is our VPs and execs are also better equipped to take decisions not any more based on their gut but based on data and fact. Tableau: And what kind of difference has using Tableau Server made?\nDavid: I think using Tableau Server to disseminate the content is something just amazing, not only because it helps us to streamline the data, to create the right message, to drive the conception, and to scale, to scale not only at the preparation of the data but also at the communication of that data. So people that are somewhere in South Africa or somewhere in Russia or somewhere in UK could get access to their data and their story for themselves and for the purpose and the scope of their own territory. So this is typically one of the things that Tableau has enabled within our organization that was definitely not there before."

All the customers were so excited about the technology and it was something that it wasn\u2019t yet so available in Chile. So we decided to make a step up and became reseller partners. It\u2019s important to give the customer a real support and confidence that they are working not only with the partner but also with the company. I mean, they can see and they can feel that the link between the partner and Tableau is so immediate; they have no problem with their business nowadays, so they can be fully confident about that. Because I don\u2019t know business is not only about business, I think it\u2019s a lot about being close to people, and they are really warm with us. Tableau: That's fantastic to hear! Can you tell us how it feels to partner with Tableau? Maurizio: The Tableau team has been excellent with us. For instance, on the tech side, or on the sales side, the support they give us is unbelievable. It get us so excited about it that in the company, in BackSpace, we feel that we must deliver at the same level or more. I think Tableau has made us a better company."

Tableau is a tool that really expedites the execution of adjustments with this information and support. Tableau: In what way?\nFernando: What Tableau does is, to have a conversation with business users in a simple way. The ease of use... sometimes there are people that, in commercial areas in general or in business areas, are afraid of new software. Tableau\u2019s simplicity in making information available, to change, to navigate\u2014people easily incorporate in the basics of these features, and they start participating and feeling ownership in what they are doing in such reports. And the tool is so adaptable, so friendly, that it allowed us to have access to that group of people with simplicity and agility. Tableau: Can you give us some examples of how you are using Tableau?\nFernando: Today, we are not only making projects, we are generating analytical modules in the company; analytical modules which I can use later in any company. And we focus the tool not only in the visualization of KPI, but also in the visualization of executable actions. Executable actions in subject areas such as supply, in areas such as layout, and in areas as Category Management, inventory, and also in democratizing information about our customers\u2019 demographics. At the end, it is the speed with which we produce changes that arise from one meeting to the next, that provides us more credentials and more credibility within the company. Finally, it lets us sell ourselves more. And not only internally. Today we are working heavily with suppliers\u2014we have a strategy of sharing the company's information in order for suppliers to help us. And suppliers are also surprised with the innovation that this project is ultimately generating for the company and the difference that this project makes compared with what you see in the retail industry. Tableau: How does this differ from how you were seeing your data before?\nFernando: The truth is that the tools we knew were tools that were highly IT-dependent. Tableau is a tool that today, my team including myself, may produce a report very simply and fast. Today there are very few tools in the market\u2014at least that I know of\u2014that have this flexibility and this naturalness between the non-technical user and the end-product visualization. Tableau: What would you say to other retailers considering a business intelligence solution like Tableau? Fernando: All companies\u2014not only retail\u2014will come to need information for their decision-making processes. The differences regarding technical aspects, service, and quality, price can be matched. Radical change comes in informed decision-making. I think Tableau is a tool that enables that."

        "content": "If you scroll through the photographs on a Shopitize customer\u2019s smartphone, you\u2019re as likely to see pictures of recent grocery till receipts as you are images of family, kittens and holidays. Shopitize unlocks the power of the humble shopping receipt, allowing UK consumers to get cashback on their regular shopping directly to their bank account once they have taken a photo of the receipt. It works like this: you download the app and browse through the offers. When you have decided what to buy, you scan the product barcode using the Shopitize app to ensure the product is on offer. Then you upload your receipt to the Shopitize app. Cash rewards are then sent directly to your bank account. For leading brand partners like Kellogg\u2019s, Danone, United Biscuits, and Innocent, Shopitize provides a direct route to retailer-agnostic mobile marketing promotions targeted at UK shoppers. Shopitize\u2019s real-time view of consumers\u2019 entire shopping basket is the secret ingredient these organizations need to optimize campaigns in real-time and increase marketing return on investment. They also use this actionable, analytical insights to help shape the future strategy of their brands. The challenge for Shopitize has been to make sense of this large-scale and complex retail data, which includes data on user demographics (collected during the registration process), in-store transactions, and retail outlets. \u201cWe previously relied on a mixed bag of spreadsheets, data aggregation, and visualisation tools to integrate and present the retail reports with brand owners,\u201d says Graham Halling, Commercial Director. \u201cIt sometimes took days to crunch through the data and create an analytical profile of a brand that we could present to one of our brand partners\u2014and by that time the data was getting ancient. If the brand partner wanted to see a different slice of the data, we had to go back and start again.\u201d Roger Pubill, Campaign Performance Manager, was equally frustrated by this labored approach to business intelligence. \u201cTo create a report, we used to extract all the data from our back-end server,\u201d he says. \u201cFor someone with limited IT experience it was a nightmare. There would be dozens of spread sheets lying on the table, and we raced around trying to make sense of the data for a report needed the next day.\u201d The visualisation of the data was key: the retail intelligence contained in the reports presented to brand partners had to be clear, concise, and immediately understandable. Dr. Alexey Andriyanenko, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Shopitize explains, \u201cIf I turned up at a client with a 150 page report, packed with spreadsheets and dull graphs showing shopping trends over time, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d even offer me a coffee. Being able to give them the results in a format they can cascade around the business, without me having to come in each time and explain it all over again, would be a powerful differentiator for Shopitize.\u201d The development of innovative new Shopitize services was also arrested by the manual approach to analytics. According to Halling, \u201cWe saw an opportunity to offer brand partners controlled market-testing of their fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) products to the audience of active smartphone shoppers, and to deliver immediately actionable findings. For example, how different shopper segments perceive brand owners\u2019 products and what promotional channels are most effective in driving behaviour-change in these segments. Analysis like this would have required an army of developers\u2014and taken months to develop.\u201d Shopitize is using Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server to create visual, actionable intelligence on two key parameters: sentiment data (what consumers think about products and the shopping experience) and the actual purchase transaction data across UK supermarkets. Tableau visualises a simple, 360 degree, and real-time view of UK consumers\u2019 brand-specific shopping basket. Brand owners can then extend this analytics to deliver retailer-agnostic mobile marketing and promotions to UK shoppers, either through the Shopitize platform or through third-party channels. Tableau is at the heart of new Shopitize service innovations too, like the Retail Reconnaissance consumer insight solution. The interactive visualisations are used to create detailed reports on consumer buying habits across the five major UK supermarkets\u2014all based on the original shopping receipts. The intelligence about what customers are buying, when and alongside which other products is all wrapped up in a visual, easy to understand format, and is used by brand owners to improve key areas such as marketing spend and stock levels. For example, Shopitize was recently tasked by a client to explore the different way males and females buy fruit in a supermarket. The visual analysis showed a large percentage of men buying fruit at the beginning of the week for their own consumption. Women were more pragmatic\u2014buying throughout the week, in greater single purchases, and often for the entire family. \u201cWhen we showed those two spikes to the brand owner, they said, \u2018now it makes sense; now we understand\u2019. Using Tableau to visualize the data makes the answer immediate and obvious,\u201d says Andriyanenko. Reports that previously took days using spreadsheets are now available in minutes. \u201cMy background is in advertising; I\u2019m not an IT guy,\u201d says Pubill. \u201cHowever, I can now put together a compelling, visual presentation on a brand\u2019s performance in just a few clicks using Tableau. And the way we present the business intelligence astounds everyone who sees it.\u201d Since going live last year, Tableau has won the admiration of the entire Shopitize team\u2014especially for its ease of use. According to Halling, \u201cWhen new staff join the company, it only takes them a day or two to become familiar with the tool and begin developing dashboards and reports.\u201d He concludes, \u201cTableau has become an integral part of our real-time actionable insights offering, which provides brands with a direct mobile channel to consumers. Tableau helps us learn about their behaviour, and we provide consumers with targeted personalised offers based on these real-time learnings.\u201d"

        "content": "InterWorks helps companies around the world deal with business intelligence, IT services, software development, and web strategy. In this video, senior BI consultant for the Europe region, Marcel Bosboom, discusses partnering with Tableau. Tableau: What types of customers come to InterWorks for help with Tableau?\nMarcel Bosboom, Senior BI consultant, Europe: We have a lot of customers. There's actually no vertical where we are not present, because we've been a long player in the Tableau world. We've been implementing for Tableau for small companies that have just two, three people working with Tableau, to companies that are the size of Facebook, Apple, and Unilever, the larger names in the organizations, enterprise customers who we've been servicing and helping them on a day-to-day basis, even now today. Tableau: What are some typical issues clients bring to you?\nMarcel: A lot of the problems the customers have is that they have these old tools already in place and we call them old tools even if they're just from the past five years. But, their problem is that they can't translate their data into quick reporting. So what we do is we give them the ability to just connect to that data and actually do analysis, not just create some kind of report that they get on a daily basis, but something that they can connect to, look into, click on different data points and see what that is really about and dig deeper into the data. And that's where InterWorks helps their customers with all the information that they need about knowing what you can do with your data, to the point that it's visualized. And that's where we use Tableau. And that's our only tool that we use to visualize data, because we believe that's the product to use. Tableau: What\u2019s partnering with Tableau been like? Marcel: It's an exciting environment knowing everybody at Tableau. It's our main product that we believe in and we built a complete ecosystem around it that we can support the customers using Tableau. And what Tableau has got on the roadmap for creating for the future I think it's going to be a lot more fun and our business is going to grow a lot more. We are already over 150 employees worldwide, and that is growing very fast. Tableau is very focused on being connected with their partners, as well. So as we put energy into the relationship with Tableau, Tableau gives us back the information that we need to help our customers and leads that we develop, and leads that they develop, and sometimes need our support, because we are in the field. We are at the business. We've been helping customers like Facebook, like Unilever, like Nike, all these customers we have supported already with implementing Tableau. Tableau: How long have you been working with Tableau?\nMarcel: I've been working with Tableau since 2007. It's been an awesome experience. We've found from version 3.5 to now almost version 9 it's been an exceptional ride, all the new features, all the things that you can do with it now, in contrast to what we could do in the past, the ways that we can visualize data, how easy it is, how easy to use. That makes it for us a great tool to actually give it to our customers and say try this and see what you can do with it. And basically that sells them the product, sells them on it, and makes them excited about doing something with their data. Tableau: Can you say more about how Tableau has transformed your job?\nMarcel: Yes, I was a CIO for Europe. I was responsible for seven countries making sure all the data was connected and making sure the infrastructure was working in Europe. And I had the trouble that I had an SAP system, an ERP system from Exact Software, a unit for all kinds of different countries that had their different financial software, different logistics software. And I had to make reports. I used Business Objects at the time, so I would generally spend one-and-a-half weeks just making the reports each month. I went from that, spending a little over a week in time developing a database and developing the reports, from spending that one-and-a-half weeks of time every month to just spending one day making sure I've got all the data, data analytics, and show that every Monday, hey, this is the new data for this week, instead of showing every month. So we were very agile all of a sudden. And for me that meant that freed up time to really help the organization make better decisions on finances, make better decisions on logistics, make better decisions on what to do in sales. That really helped us in developing and for me that made my life a little bit more exciting than being locked up just creating some reports and today I'm helping a lot of other customers using Tableau. And that's an exciting environment, because I go to all these small companies and big companies and helping them understand what we can do with Tableau for them. So for me it's been a roller coaster ride for the past years, kind of fun. Tableau: Can you tell us more about InterWorks?\nMarcel: Well, InterWorks is a global company. It's not only Europe; we are active around the globe. We have a team in the States; we have a team in the UK, in Holland, in Germany. We are present throughout the business areas where you are. So whatever vertical you're active, we can help you. And one of the things that should show you that we are really committed to the Tableau environment is that we've created a new package called the Power Tools for Tableau, which is as program suite that enables you to work better with Tableau. It enables you to manage your workbooks, audit your workbooks."

In this video, country manager Jurriaan Krielaart and sales engineer Michel De Ru discuss \u201chow MarkLogic and Tableau are leveraging each other's knowledge to help customers enable more data-driven decision-making.\u201d Tableau: What\u2019s your favorite thing about partnering with Tableau?\nJurriaan Krielaart, country manager: What excites me about working together with Tableau is that both our organizations enable customers to make absolutely good use of data in their day-to-day work, right? The biggest struggle that we see customers are having is that they are unable to really quickly use the silos within their organizations and combine data that's being stored in different kind of systems and files within organizations. With the enablement of MarkLogic and Tableau, customers can be up and running\u2014disintegrating those silos within a couple of weeks and build applications that they can leverage for their decision-making. Tableau: That\u2019s fantastic! Can you give us an example of a customer having this kind of success?\nJurriaan: It's really amazing. We just had a big event where our CEO was speaking and we had a large bank that's in Germany that was enabled to build an application within six months that they have been struggling with for over 18 months in the past with other technologies. So to leverage this kind of speed and to enable people to actually use the data, that's a great benefit for customers and hopefully for people that decide later on to choose the combination of MarkLogic and Tableau. Tableau: Can you describe how the MarkLogic and Tableau offerings benefit the customer when implemented together? Michel De Ru, sales engineer: Tableau and MarkLogic are really complementary to each other. It really enables users to not only look at structured data, but also to look at unstructured data and make decisions based on that. We are able to ingest all the unstructured data that you would have, like Word documents, tweets, social media data, and we can create a view on top of that. And by using that view we can connect to Tableau again and thereby visualizing all that data. Additionally MarkLogic also integrates an enterprise search engine. And that really offers new kinds of functionality through Tableau, because users will now be able to use the enterprise search functionality, make a subsection of the data by using search, enterprise search, and then drill down through the graphic visualization that Tableau does. Jurriaan: So it's been really interesting about how to see to see how MarkLogic and Tableau are leveraging each other's knowledge to help customers enable more data-driven decision-making. And that's really where we benefit. Lots of customers from MarkLogic are interested in Tableau and a lot of the customers from Tableau are interested in MarkLogic. So we think it's a perfect match between the two companies. Tableau: What kinds of data do you deal with?\nJurriaan: It can vary from the text on web sites, PDF documents, XML data that's being stored in different sites and silos within organizations. To leverage that data no matter what the structure is that's the importance of MarkLogic. Being able to connect to that data via your dashboards and your business intelligence applications from Tableau enables customers to make decisions also on that kind of data."

In this video, CTO Craig Bloodworth discusses how Tableau \u201cgets (clients) exploring\u2014 and excited about what they're using.\u201d Tableau: How did you first come across about Tableau?\nCraig Bloodworth, CTO: I discovered Tableau based on problems with Excel. So I downloaded it (Tableau) after four days of working with the mass spreadsheet. I demoed it Friday morning. Installed it, connected to the data, drew all the same charts again, new dashboards, and finished by the end of the day. And it was really that's when the penny dropped for me. And I believe I got my credit card out that night and I still own my own copy. Tableau: We love that! Tell us about what you\u2019re doing these days.\nCraig: I manage a team of consultants and try and do some really cool stuff with Tableau, try to push it to the edge and bring in new technology, new integration and just generally kind of having fun. One of Craig's \"just for fun\" vizzes tracking his movements in a day. Watch the video to see it in action. Tableau: In a nutshell, what does The Information Lab do?\nCraig: We really focus on doing what's right for the customer there and then. And that doesn't mean necessarily entering into a long sort of 6-month, 12-month engagement. It means that they have discovered Tableau usually. They have data they think they can get something from. And we just help kick start them and get them in the right direction. They then usually do go into some training and then they go off and run with it themselves, because they know the data, they know what they want to get out of it. It's really nice to see people take something that you've shown them, something that interests them and then take it their own way and then get to join up with them later and see what they've created. And they feed it back to us and we get some insight into how they use it. Tableau: In your mind, is there anything that sets Tableau apart from other software companies?\nCraig: So there are very few technology companies that... everybody in the company loves to be a part of, and loves to know that they're opening one piece of software that day and it's Tableau and their day is going to be great. Because they can just do all their work, they know they're going to achieve a lot of stuff, knowing they're going to make customers happy. And then when it comes to taking all that experience and going back to Tableau and saying we'd really like our customers to be able to do more, or to do it slightly differently, to have the face-to-face contact with the same guys who are doing development, who run the company, I think it's pretty unique and it's a big testimony to Tableau. Tableau: Who exactly in your company uses Tableau? Craig: All sorts, I don't think there's a single department, a single vertical that can't use Tableau. Everyone these days has data and has insight they can derive from that data. I look and I see banking companies, I see logistics, I see even a karaoke bar in London is a Tableau customer. Now they get great insight from the data that's generated by their till system. And people who aren't even employed to analyze that data get excited by seeing the lines go up, or they're meeting their target for that night. It feels pretty good to see them getting brand new insight from data that's been around forever and they never thought they were going to be able to do anything with. Tableau: What\u2019s introducing people to Tableau like?\nCraig: Presenting Tableau for the first time you can see sort of in the room people sit up and sort of their eyes widen, because you're just showing them that working with data doesn't have to be difficult. My best experience with showing someone Tableau was a one-day engagement I did with a market analysis company. They gave me a big data set at the start of the day. By lunchtime we kind of explored the data, got all the meaning out, and then by the end of the day we created about five dashboards. And we had a company director right behind us asking questions of the data, their own data, and we're answering them on the fly. And they get to leave now with a great workbook they can use to take to their clients and show them what the data can do for them. Tableau: What sort of data are you typically helping your customers connect to with Tableau?\nCraig: Our customers have connected Tableau mainly to the classic database systems. We're seeing a lot more people moving to the cloud now. I believe in one week I had three different customers requesting demos with Amazon Redshift. People are very excited by things like Google Analytics and Salesforce. They can really see how they can take stuff that they've been adding to these systems for years and now they can get insight and it can feedback to them instantly. Tableau: What kind of impact has Tableau had on your life?\nCraig: Personally, Tableau has made a big change to my career. Since adopting it fully and joining The Information Lab I've found myself working a lot with The Guardian data blog, for instance, just as Tableau Public was getting really popular. I since then, about a year later, got the Tableau Visionary accreditation, and found myself going from a two-person company, two-and-a-half years ago, to now The Information Lab is 14 consultants and growing."

So it had a major impact on the company, on the growth of the company. It brought a lot of fun and better interaction with data with our customers. They contact us, because we're known in the market, since we're a Tableau Gold Partner. Since a couple of months we know why the Magic Quadrant is called the Magic Quadrant\u2014because since Tableau is high up in the Gartner quadrant, we get a lot of new business from companies who are looking into Tableau and want to explore it. Tableau: How do clients react to Tableau?\nDaan Vloedgraven, Consultant: When I'm showing them the Tableau show most of the time they are applauding, because they like the way we show their business. So they give them their data, and we show them how their business works and normally they like it. It's about knowing what you didn't know before, I think that's the most important, but also the saving of time. Tableau: What kind of clients do you work with?\nRuud: We do a lot in the educational sector. And one of our success stories also is the Rabobank in the Netherlands, where we started with one Tableau desktop and it grew all over the company with a lot of desktops a lot of servers and business is loving it, and it's exactly the way Tableau should be used, and bringing the data into the hands of the business and let them make their own decisions. Tableau matches with our genes. What we can do with data now, we wanted to do from the start of our company. It was in the genes of our company\u2014and Tableau was an enabler to do that what we always wanted. We are not technicians. We are not IT. We do business administration. We're business people and that's why we like Tableau. I'm not a SQL query programmer. I like to work with data and that's what Tableau enables me to do. Tableau: You\u2019ve been with Tableau for a while now\u2014how did you first hear about us?\nRuud: We started working with Tableau about five years ago. We did traditional BI and we had a lot of data, but we couldn't get it across very well. I saw Tableau, downloaded it, version 5.0, and we bought a ticket, went to the States, went to visit the Tableau Conference and that's where it started and we liked it and we like it even more now than we did five years ago. Tableau: What do you see for the future of Infotopics and Tableau?\nRuud: I think the future is very bright, because there is data everywhere and it's growing. And we are still I think pioneers in data discovery and we hope to be at the forefront for the next couple of years, as well. And we try to hire good people for that and I think the future looks bright and as Tableau we will continue to grow."

This meant considerable effort, given the website has approximately 7 million visitors per month and the yearly transaction volume is in the double digit billions. In the past this resulted in 0.5 to 5 workdays of effort, depending on the task at hand. Now even short term and detailed analysis requests can be answered flexibly, without time-consuming feedback loops. The comprehensive experience of M2. technology & project consulting GmbH in the implementation of Tableau and in the automotive sector enabled a quick recording of the specific market requirements and their implementation into an innovative solution. The Tableau solution drastically reduces the work effort, from days to a few hours. It is possible to change request parameters within minutes, providing short response times for short term changes. The Tableau software-based reporting platform has been established as a new business sector. Through ease-of-use and efficient access to automotive data, combined with high request flexibility, the clients of mobile.de receive important insights. For example, the value of car models develops depending on the particular trim line and this influences their ultimate sales price. This can now be perceived. The quota of utilization by automotive manufacturers is currently approximately 100 views per month."

My role is to enable the company to have better access to information and to make smart, accurate decisions based on what the data is telling us about our products and about our markets. Tableau: How are people in the company responding to seeing data visually? Are you seeing an impact?\nKirill: Just to give you a quick example, we were one evening sitting with the CEO of Aeria Games\u2014his name is Pascal\u2014and we were just throwing together some visualizations by country, seeing where our most profitable customers are. And as we were doing it he said stop, stop, let's have a look at this. 'What's up in Singapore?' We have some really profitable customers, but we didn't know that before. Seeing that kind of opened up absolutely new opportunities for our company, in terms of understanding where we should invest next and what markets we should expand into and what markets we need to still improve our performance. Tableau: It sounds like you're receiving a rather warm welcome!\nKirill: Deep down inside everybody is an analyst. With Tableau, they can go on this discovery path and find out new opportunities and better ways to deliver their products they're delivering, and better ways to monetize the customer, and also give the customer a better experience within our games. Tableau: What is your favorite thing about our solution?\nKirill: My favorite thing about Tableau is by far the way it enables my team to deliver great stories through visualization. It delivers something that everybody can understand across the whole organization. You look at it and see the story that we're trying to tell. Tableau: You've been using Tableau Cloud, our cloud-based solution. What has your experience been so far?\nKirill: We are big supporters of Tableau Cloud, because it enables us to focus on what we do best, which is designing analysis, designing reports, and then through Tableau Cloud to share it across our organization. This way we don't really have to maintain any hardware or focus any resources on the infrastructure maintenance of the reports. So we create a report, we just push it into the cloud. Tableau: Are you finding Tableau compatible with multiple data sources?\nKirill: We work with a proliferation of data sources starting from Hadoop down to Excel. We also work a lot with cloud technologies like Amazon Redshift. I was very pleasantly surprised to know that Tableau can provide native connectivity to all those data sources, whether it's the CSV files that our IT team provides to us, to Excel sheets where our finance department likes to keep the budgets and the forecasts to a Hadoop cluster where we store our logs and where we store more granular data that doesn't yet fit into our data warehouse. Tableau: How much data are you working with in Tableau?\nKirill: We like to keep our data warehouse small and agile. And as such our data warehouse is fairly small right now\u2014it's under one terabyte. But overall we are working with data that exceeds 15 terabytes in size. Tableau: Any tips for introducing Tableau to employees?\nKirill: The way we bring Tableau effectively within the company is first we allow users to discover it on their own\u2014just to get them a little bit excited about it and also make them understand that you don't need a long learning curve to understand this tool. Once they start becoming interested, those individuals that really want to learn the tool and make it part of their career, we send on the professional training that's provided by Tableau. When they come back they've become a Tableau expert that\u2014like Jedis\u2014can whip up any kind of dashboards in a matter of hours, or minutes, depending on the complexity of the dashboards. Tableau: That's wonderful. Would you say that choosing Tableau has been a positive for your career?\nKirill: Championing this kind of tool throughout the organization had a very positive experience on my career, because bringing it in allowed me to connect people directly with the data and people love data"

Tableau: How much faster? Adriana: What used to take us fifteen days, today we can extract in a couple of hours and, with Tableau, already we have a diagnosis. Wow, it solved all of our problems. So, it has been extremely satisfactory. Tableau: You worked closely with PATH, a Tableau Silver partner. Can you tell us about that experience?\nAdriana: We received support through Path, at every moment, not only during the system integration, but also in training our administrative user, the people that administrates our system, as well as other people, the users, normally in the daily use. We had all the consulting services, and that was very important for our work, because they gave us the idea of what we could have, such as... what were our possibilities from that moment on, and they customized our system, so our users could use it, could handle it in a way that was calm and easy to understand. Tableau: What would your work be like without Tableau?\nAdriana: Without Tableau, it would be extremely difficult to keep the quality standard of the work in \u201cDisque Den\u00fancia\u201d, which is today one of the most respected public services in Rio de Janiero. It would be very difficult for us to keep such quality standard. Tableau: Have you noticed other benefits?\nAdriana: Without Tableau, it would be like going back to the typewriter. So, it has been extremely satisfactory, we realize the team is even more motivated, people work with more willingness, as we have a tool that really performs what we are expecting. So, it was truly important. Tableau: Would you recommend Tableau to others?\nAdriana: I already recommend the use of Tableau, we work with several partners, the police as a whole, Public Security, is governed by databases. So when we take someone to Disque Den\u00fancia and introduce them to the system, people get really excited about it. Tableau: Can you tell us how Disque Den\u00fancia is helping the UPPs (Police Pacifier Units) identify locations of criminal activity?\nAdriana: Disque Den\u00fancia has been using this system, Tableau, since 2012\u2014 and it is a major case, very interesting about the UPPs (Police Pacifier Units). We had the very first great experience with the tool to identify, that is the migration. Because as the communities became occupied, the criminals start going to other locations and Tableau became quickly essential to provide the information that had to reach the police quickly. And it enabled us to identify where the criminals were moving to. Thus it enabled even a larger police force on those locations to be able to prevent them from settling there."

In this video, Marcos Antonio Almeida Silva, Systems Manager and Pedro Praxedes, Director of Systems & Logistics, talk about using Tableau to speed insight into Pague Menos\u2019 data. Video in Portuguese: Tableau: What do you tell people who ask about your experience with Tableau? Mr. Pedro Praxedes, Diretor de Sistemas & Log\u00edstica: Tableau is a tool that I recommend to any organization. It very easy to use, very simple. Most interestingly, it does not depend on the size of the company...I can have a small company, I can have a tool such as Tableau to help me day-to-day\u2014just as I can have a huge organization with Tableau. That's a major advantage. Tableau: Would you recommend Tableau to others considering it for business intelligence?\nPraxedes: The tool covers all the areas in a company, of course, within the complexity of each organization. So I do recommend, with no doubts, saying that Tableau can help any company with analyzing, focusing the data\u2014 transforming these data into information and thus helping to make decisions based on that. Tableau: What was your first impression of Tableau?\nPraxedes: When we were introduced to Tableau, we got really excited about it. We thought it was a really interesting tool. Tableau: Can you describe the decision process?\nPraxedes: So it was a joint selection process, IT and the user base.\nMarcos Antonio Almeida Silva, Systems Manager: What motivated the acquisition of Tableau was the governance requirements\u2014which we started two years ago, a process of IT governance and the creation of a sector when the company went public. That increased our response time, as because our demand has increased. (So) we wanted a tool that were more user-oriented and less IT-oriented. Tableau: Can you describe the experience before Tableau?\nSilva: Without Tableau, the access to data, particularly of the sales database\u2014which is huge\u2014would take too long. The operations area had a delay of about five days to have the information available, mine the data and then clean it, before delivery. Tableau: And now?\nSilva:: Currently, we access in minutes a database with 200 million lines. Today this information is practically immediate, as our database is loaded daily, so during the night Tableau loads the information on the database and from there it will be available the following morning. Tableau: That\u2019s great! Finally, how has your choice of Tableau changed the use of data at Pague Menos?\nSilva: The user owns the demand now. When he has a new requirement, he will develop it. So this, in a certain way, has changed the game rules. The user today has the ability to solve some issues that previously were not clear; the user would only have this result when the IT area made the report or a dashboard available according to his/her needs. So, this analysis he/she can achieve today with a simple access to Tableau, even preparing it at that moment, a direct analysis on the database. With it (Tableau), it is possible to make faster decisions\u2014this will bring a result to the company. Tableau: What was the importance of having received consulting from (Tableau Silver Partner) PATH?\nPraxedes: The consulting was essential, due to the training part, for the user and for the IT area, and we also took part in the training. The consulting brought us these shortcuts that could provide us this faster path to reach that result."

        "company": "Lift12",
        "content": "Lift12, a Singapore-based company, is a new player in the fashion industry. With eight employees in Singapore and China, Lift12 aspires to be the 21st century version of fashion labels such as Zara. The company is run very much like an internet company, combining social media trends with data analytics to make most of their design decisions. Lift12 is currently just over a year old and with the help of Tableau Software, it already has a foothold in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, with plans to expand into the Australian market. The fashion industry in Singapore is estimated to generate S$4.4 billion (US$3.5 billion) a year, making up about two percent of the global apparels market . Singapore\u2019s fashion industry has experienced rapid growth in the past few years and this trend is likely to continue. The Singapore government also extensively supports the local fashion industry by offering funding initiatives and supporting the two largest fashion events in the country \u2013 The Singapore Fashion Week and Singapore Fashion Festival, which brings in over 20,000 visitors each year. In general, data analytics is seldom associated with the fashion industry. The team at Lift12 is bucking the trend to find innovative ways to combine them into a unique and viable business model - utilizing data analytics to determine customer preferences and industry trends and drive towards customer satisfaction. In the fast changing world of fashion, companies need to constantly keep up with fashion trends and customer preferences or risk losing out to competitors. To gain insights into customer preferences and accurately predict industry trends, Lift12 monitors customer comments and responses on social media. They then tap online voting tools to gain an understanding of customer likes and dislikes. All this translates into over 17 gigabytes of data from various sources, including customer purchase history, social media and other information on the internet, like color preferences and trends, the latest fashion styles and most preferred methods of payment. With the insights gained, Lift12 is able to combine the information with customer purchase history to refine and offer customers personalized fashion options. Lift12 also utilizes these tools to accurately keep track of inventory levels, ensuring that their products do not run out of stock. This data offers Lift12 valuable insights into different areas of customer needs, and when pieced together, help the Company form a broad picture of the direction the industry is heading towards. The team also expects the amount of data that they collect and analyze to grow as more avenues of data sources are added. \u201cBy combining the information that we have with other data that is readily available on the internet, such as color preferences and prices, we can react quickly to new trends in order to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers,\u201d Andrew Wolf, Co-founder and Creative Director at Lift12 explained. Lift12 used to take two weeks to analyze the data that\u2019s been collected. This was due to the multiple formats that the data came in, which required different programs to run and interpret before being fed into the system. Lift12 needed a way to analyze data faster and more efficiently due to the fast paced nature of the industry. \u201cTime is money in the vibrant and changing landscape of the fashion industry. The ability to predict trends and make informed decisions, such as when to discontinue a product line and how much to stock in our various channels, could mean huge savings and profits,\u201d Andrew added. Lift12 first heard about Tableau Software through articles published in news and technology media outlets and decided to arrange a meeting in the Singapore headquarters for a demonstration of Tableau Desktop. The demonstration highlighted significant reductions in time taken for data analysis and Lift12 came out of the meeting impressed with the user friendliness of the software. Lift12 currently utilizes Tableau Desktop \u2013 an intuitive data analytical tool that allows drag-and-drop analysis of data. The Company is encouraging more of its employees to make use of the tool to gain diverse insights, including tracking seasonal demands. Although Lift12 has only been utilizing Tableau for about six months (to-date), there has already been a significant positive impact on its business. \u201cThe fact that we have been able to expand our business into five different countries in Southeast Asia after only six months, with the help of Tableau, is a testament to the effectiveness of the software and the efficiency it brings to Lift12,\u201d Andrew said. The time taken to analyze data changed significantly after Lift12 started to use Tableau Software. Tableau\u2019s capability to accept multiple data formats allows for information, such as customer purchase history, apparel trends and sales reports, to be fed directly into the system, enabling the rapid production of visualizations that are up to date and easy to comprehend. \u201cEquipped with this information, we are now able to reduce excess stock, deliver products quicker and increase our sales. With Tableau Software, analysis that used to take us two weeks is now cut down to just 30 minutes,\u201d he added."

We've got a lot of people that are wanting a lot of stuff from us, as any analytical team is. So anything that can save time, anything that can give you the answer better is going to be\u2014is going to be good for me. Tableau: Can you describe the primary challenge in competing in the online betting industry?\nTony: We exist in a weird sort of industry where our products are relatively similar to our competitors' products. There's not that much that differentiates it. So the differentiating factor is basically being smarter and the way to be smarter is being smarter with your data. So in terms of our industry, I think it's paramount to be quick. Our industry also being fully digital and dealing in the online space, our competitors have a lot of data available to them, as do we. But it's a matter of actually turning that data into something, into an insight, and it's a matter of acting quickly. And because you're digital as well, things can move a lot faster. Campaigns can go up a lot quicker, and people can change their promotions a lot faster than maybe in the traditional sort of offline world. Tableau: How does Tableau fit into that? Tony: Tableau allows you to be smarter faster. It's a very quick-moving industry. You can't wait weeks to do pieces of analysis and weeks to act on things or else you will miss the boat. Tableau: What were things like before Tableau?\nTony: A lot of the analysis that we'd been doing had been sort of with Excel and tools that probably weren't really suited to what we're doing. The analysis itself was taking a lot more time. And it wasn't as enriched as well because, when you're analyzing data, you want as much data as you can. You don't want to have to be stuck on a certain answer because the data set basically only allows you to go with that answer. Tableau: So Tableau helps you track customer data?\nTony: We can see everything the customer does. There's nothing that goes untracked. The flip side of that is we have an awful lot of data, and there's only X amount of people that can analyze that data and make sense of it. So this is where we need the likes of Tableau to come in and help to sort through that data a lot faster and be smarter with the decisions that we make. Tableau: What does this speed mean for your company?\nTony: Being able to get to answers faster is a big thing. I mean, we need to be smarter than our competitors. Tableau: Do you use Tableau yourself?\nTony: It's also helped me, when I have to roll my sleeves up and get into the analysis and whatever, it's -- I find that as a tool, it's very easy to use and I enjoy using Tableau, actually. Tableau: Is there anything you would want to share with someone considering Tableau for the first time?\nTony: To get it up and running properly, you need to train users to get the best out of the tool. So it's not like you can install it and it's a magic bullet and overnight you're got what you need. But compared to other technology projects, I would say it's very good. And, I mean, we've already spoken about the benefits of it. I think those benefits definitely outweigh the cost. I mean, in terms of return on investment, I think the thing definitely pays for itself. One of the problems with Tableau\u2014and this is a funny problem\u2014is that from an IT point of view, it's almost too simple to get it set up and running. I think when they see how simple it is, it scares them a little bit and it makes them think, \"Why is it so easy?\""

Tableau: So how do you find your stories?\nCraig: There are a lot of different ways you can actually start off a story now. Rather than having to rely on sources or having to rely on\u2014at the very worst\u2014press releases. (Instead) it's given us something that we can have a look at\u2014this data that's been put out there or that we are given\u2014and actually find the stories ourselves. Tableau: How much time do you have to produce your stories and visualizations?\nCraig: Sometimes I'll get in to work and I'll have to pitch a story, write it, find a case study, and do a graphic for print and online and iPad all in the space of a day. So having tools available that allow me to turn around interactives and dashboards very quickly without having to do too much work on all the design and all the bespoke elements is really handy. Tableau: That's great to hear! Is a day the tightest deadline you typically face? Craig: Sometimes with Tableau there have been stories that have come up and I've put a dashboard up within about 20 minutes\u2014just because the data's been perfectly formatted and I've sort of known how to do a quick bar chart with a few filters or something like that to get people interested in exploring the data for themselves. Tableau: Wow, glad to hear we're able to help you meet your deadlines! Does Tableau come up in any other areas of your professional life?\nCraig: I've taught classes in data journalism and Tableau has been one of the tools I've shown people in there. Tableau: That's great to hear. What are your thoughts about the future of data journalism?\nCraig: I think it's definitely a growing area. As more data\u2014if there's more information being codified, as data sets get bigger, as more people are using data as the basis of decision making, it makes sense for journalists to be in this space."

And we look after a whole bunch of students that come on campus and do clinical placements for medical students, nursing students, allied health students, and help them become nurses and doctors. Tableau: What are some of the challenges of managing SPOT?\nTroy: So in the health sector, the IT services is very focused on the clinical systems, as they should be, because that's the patient-facing systems such as the patient information, the booking systems, the X-ray systems. And if they go down, that's a danger to life. It was basically how do we get information quickly without having to rely on our IT services. Tableau: What are the consequences of that?\nTroy: So the support people like me, in education, we come second, as we should. So our reports, if we sent them off to IT, would take a long time to get back. So using Tableau has kind of let us go to a self-service sort of model so we can build our own, look at our own data sets without bothering their important work, I guess. Tableau: What\u2019s a particular task that was challenging for you?\nTroy: When the government asked us how many placements we had across the campus for their data\u2014because they're looking at future growth trends and demographics and how many health professionals we're going to need in the future\u2014we had no clear answer for them. It was done individually across the hospital. So we had a clinical placement coordinator that was trying to find all that data across the hospital, put it into an Excel spreadsheet themselves, and then work out any sort of semblance of reporting from that very sketchy data collection process. Tableau: And how is your job easier now?\nTroy: And that's where Tableau came in because before that, we had to send off the Excel spreadsheet to someone that could do Excel spreadsheet manipulations and get the reports in a readable format. Tableau: What\u2019s another task Tableau has helped you with? Troy: We had a certain set of growth targets that we had to hit, and we had to figure out if we had them, how to hit them. SPOT had all the data in it, and Tableau just let us pull that out straight away. Two years ago when we didn't have SPOT and Tableau, it took about two weeks in order to get that information and get it back to HWA. So, a reduction from two weeks to five minutes. If you want something easy to use and you want the ability to have instantaneous visualizations, then definitely\u2014look at Tableau."

In this video, senior analyst Yao Tang discusses how Tableau is \u201ca huge time-saver.\u201d Tableau: Can you tell us a little about Inivio?\nYao Tang, Senior Analyst: Day-to-day, Inivio is a database marketing agency. We do data-driven marketing as well as analytics. We've been collecting data for a very long time. So we have information on over, I think, 16 million Australian consumers and two million businesses, and hundreds of attributes along those lines. And these are attributes not only at the personal level, but at geographic levels, research information, all sorts of unstructured information that we do need to blend in from time to time. Tableau: How did you see and understand your data before Tableau?\nYao: We felt that a lot of the tools that we were using before to analyze and visual and report back to our clients and even internally weren't really fit for purpose anymore. We needed to go out into the market to find a tool that was more compatible with the way that we were working now\u2014in a space that's very multi-channel, it's very dynamic, it's very responsive\u2014whereas a lot of our processes from before were quite standardized and structured. So we investigated a range of visualization tools, and we settled on Tableau mainly because of two things, speed to insight as well as connectivity, because we use a lot of disparate data sources and a lot of different types of databases to store all our information. And we found that Tableau is really good at blending all of those together. A scatterplot of demographic data, filtered by single parent household status Tableau: How does Tableau help exactly?\nYao: So with all of these different data sources at different levels of detail, we find that Tableau is a really quick way to explore the relationships between our different data sets without having to go through a really rigorous process of joining them in, and interpreting them through a database system. Tableau allows us to really connect things and blend them at whatever level is available, and also very quickly. So for me personally Tableau is a huge time saver. I'm a really big proponent of it and a big user of it. I use it every day. And I'd say roughly it cuts down my production time by about 30 percent. I'd say overall we've increased our productivity by at least 10 to 15 percent, in terms of man-hours for results. But, more importantly, I think it's enabled a lot of analyst created self-service tools through publishing that we don't need to go to a development team to implement. Without Tableau I think we'd find it a lot less efficient and a lot more difficult to present insights to clients. So without having Tableau I think our efficiency would be down our profitability would be down. Tableau: Do you have anything else to add about Tableau?\nYao: I really like using Tableau. I even use it in my daily life. Outside of work I've recently been on a bit of a fitness and health kick and trying to lose weight and gain muscle and things like that. As an analyst it's a bit difficult, because you don't get out much. And I was just doing some data entry through a little phone app. But, then I managed to download that information and really analyze my own progress through Tableau. And it's allowed me to sort of get an insight into the workings of even my own fitness and my own body. So that was really interesting."

Tableau: And what do you do at Anomaly?\nBrendan: So head of analytics and visualization is really working with clients, predominantly in the media space, to understand what are their needs are, or really try and understand what's driving their media investments. We work with those clients to understand how can we improve the efficiency of their investments and look to optimize them over time. Tableau: How were you looking at data before Tableau?\nBrendan: Prior to using Tableau there wasn't much visualization that was utilized at Anomaly. It was mostly Excel, just presenting information in Excel through tables and graphs. Tableau: What do you like about Tableau?\nBrendan: Tableau is great at disseminating information and it's a great tool to consolidate information. Tableau: Do you blend data from multiple sources, then?\nBrendan: We do a lot of blending of data. I would say we connect data that might not have a connection in place. We blend data together to try and create things like return on investment. Tableau: How does Tableau Server help you communicate and share your insights?\nBrendan: So some of the benefits we get with Tableau Server is we're able to disseminate multiple dashboards to clients. There are a lot of security features that come with Tableau Server, as well as the main processing power behind the server helps us scale out to multiple clients. Tableau: How do your clients typically react to seeing Tableau in action?\nBrendan: So when my clients typically see Tableau for the first time they get gob-smacked, particularly because they have never seen the data in that light. They've always seen numbers charts and tables. But, Tableau just brings data to life. And so it really is a visualization tool that enhances the numbers. And so they've been gob-smacked. Tableau: What do you like most about using Tableau? What makes the biggest difference to your business?\nBrendan: I'd say the speed of Tableau is remarkable from many other systems that I've used. It's very good at pulling information together, but also processing it. So the speed is fantastic when you want to do on-the-fly calculations. One reason why I think Tableau is great is it\u2019s really backed by a lot of robust functionality. And it's really a buzzword in the industry. Tableau: Do you highlight your use of Tableau in your own marketing efforts?\nBrendan: So when I mention to clients that I'm using Tableau they have a lot of confidence. If I used a system that was probably not well known they might be reluctant to utilize our services. But, when I mention that we use Tableau there's a lot of enthusiasm behind that, because they're quite familiar with it and they've heard some great things about it. Tableau: Where do you think you\u2019d be without Tableau?\nBrendan: Good question. It's a hard one to answer, because Tableau, it's really propelled us in a space that we've never been before. So to turn it off it's hard to believe. I don't think I'd want to go back there. I've been quite amazed. We've been on the journey with Tableau for maybe about two years. And it's really propelled us in a space where I haven't been with any other BI system before."

One of the executives said 'I always asked for that in the BI area and finally they managed to do it.' Tableau: Oi is a huge company. Can we assume you have a lot of data?\nRaphael: Oi is the biggest telecommunications company in Brazil, it works with cell phones, landlines, Internet and TV. We have more than 75 million customers. If we were to put in all the types of transactions and all of the events that we can have with our customers, we would have more than two hundred billion records. Tableau: And all of your various records\u2014billing, complaints, service requests, marketing promotions\u2014are those stored centrally?\nRaphael: That information is totally separate. We have several systems and it\u2019s exactly where the secret is, where Tableau comes in, trying to help us to resolve that merging of information for you to have a really single vision. Tableau: How does that single view benefit Oi?\nRaphael: We began to create that database to have a single view of sales, of shares, net ads, all the behavior in the sales area\u2014and that ended up attracting our executives a lot. Because some meetings we had were only numbers, and they ended up spending more than two hours. Now, with the visual part of Tableau, we have been spending fifteen minutes to go over all of the numbers and we get right to the point where we have problems or opportunities. Tableau: It sounds like, in addition to gaining a single view of the data, you\u2019re also saving time.\nRaphael: Some of the answers, that before took days or weeks to be answered, ended up being answered at the same moment, just clicking, doing a drill-down, doing anything within the tool itself, and our quantity of answers during the meeting increased a lot and then, with that, they went away with the actions to work on until the next meeting. Tableau: Can you describe the overall benefit of Tableau to Oi?\nStein: I think what Tableau brought to us was a great change in our way of thinking. Everyone can look at the same results, so that the conflicts within the company diminish. And you publishing the data source within Tableau, you give freedom to people to have self-service BI, but they continue always looking for the same results. So, they can explore\u2014 always guaranteeing that the information is always going to be there\u2014with the same results, and the publication of the data source for me is the great secret that Tableau brings to us. I have been in the market of Business Intelligence for more than thirteen years, and, for me, it\u2019s very satisfying, to now have a team working, motivated, and trying to produce something more, not simply deliver that which was requested."

        "content": "Mater Health Services (Mater) is a privately owned, not-for-profit healthcare provider based in Brisbane, Queensland. The Catholic organisation operates seven hospitals, a medical research institute, three health centres and pathology and pharmacy businesses, all of which are underpinned by community support through the Mater Foundation. Mater Health Services has more than 7,500 staff and volunteers, providing care to more than 500,000 patients each year. Famous for the success of its clinical placement program, students are placed at Mater for the entire duration of their degree, rather than rotating through many different hospitals. This approach has seen a 27% improvement in the retention rate of graduates hired by Mater. The organisation manages more than 2,600 undergraduate students, across its own nursing program, and through medical, allied health and midwifery placements from partnered universities. Mater Health Services needed to build a database to better manage its undergraduate students on campus. \u201cWe have partnerships with many universities, and we\u2019d often be faced with situations where out of the blue 20 students would turn up on a ward and we wouldn\u2019t be prepared for them. Each professional group within the university was managed independently and it was difficult to keep track of everything,\u201d says Caroline Hudson, Executive Director People and Learning. \u201cWe also didn\u2019t have detailed records for the students or ourselves, or any performance tracking to understand what was going on between the student and the facilitators,\u201d says Hudson. At the same time, the Federal Government wanted to increase clinical placements in hospitals as part of its strategy to address workforce shortages in the healthcare industry. Funding and grants became available for programs that could demonstrate an ability to increase capacity. This meant Mater needed to have a clear view of exactly how many students it could support through clinical placement. \u201cAt one particular point we were asked to undertake an audit of how many students we had on campus. It took weeks for us to finalise the information and we knew the moment we\u2019d collected it in a spread sheet it would already be out of date,\u201d she says. Hudson decided it was important to build a live, dynamic database so decision makers could see what was going on in essentially real time. \u201cBuilding a tool with our previous business reporting tool was time-consuming to build the tools I needed and I wanted something that was quite responsive and potentially something we could manage on our own,\u201d she says. Mater needed a solution that was easy to use. \u201cClinical staff are very quick to reject something that is difficult or time-consuming to use. These are very busy people under a lot of pressure,\u201d she says. Mater worked with an external vendor to build a tool that would manage student shifts, records and rosters while they were on clinical placement. SPOT, short for Student Placement Online Tool, is a web-based solution for managing and coordinating student clinical placements. Students are able to log into the tool themselves, manage their rosters and book their own shifts. Mater is then able to manage the records and rosters. The next step was to find a reporting tool. \u201cWe had built a fantastic tool, but we needed to extract the data from it,\u201d Hudson explains. \u201cThe last piece of the puzzle was to add the reporting functionality, and that\u2019s where Tableau came in. I consulted with Deloitte who came back to me with a few recommendations but Tableau Desktop was the clear standout.\u201d Today, Mater authors visualisations using Tableau Desktop. They publish their completed report using Tableau Server integrated into the web application, SPOT. Hudson said Tableau has given managers flexibility around how they view different data sets in a way they didn\u2019t have before. \u201cWe\u2019ve done some really cool work in visualising capacity and in developing the capability around management reports,\u201d says Hudson. \u201cThe timeliness of the information is absolutely critical and Tableau has definitely been able to take this on. In a ward situation you want to be able to see very timely information in terms of your students and also look forward for capacity planning.\u201d Mater draws the Tableau reports directly from the live databases, so the data is constantly refreshing. The reports built as standard from Tableau and integrated through SPOT generate within 30 seconds for front end users. A custom report can be designed and implemented within 2 to 3 hours. \u201cI have a very strong view that we shouldn\u2019t be implementing technology that requires a lot of training to be able to use it. If you think about things like iPads and iPhones, none of us spend a lot of time thinking about how we use them. We can use them intuitively!\u201d says Hudson. In terms of the SPOT visualisations, because users are accessing the integrated Tableau dashboards on the Server via the SPOT application, Mater has not had to \u201ctrain\u201d users. They simply click filters and review the visualisations. \u201cTableau gives you insights that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t have, so you don\u2019t spend as much time worrying about the technology itself and how to use it. You\u2019re focused on the outcomes that you\u2019re getting, and what the data is telling you.\u201d \u201cWith other reporting tools you can get bogged down in the functionality, but with Tableau, the information becomes the thing you focus on, which is actually what it should be about rather than using the tool,\u201d says Hudson. Since integrating Tableau dashboards into the SPOT web application, Mater has qualified for two initial grants. \u201cTableau in SPOT was key to the reporting needed to these grants,\u201d Hudson says. Other health organisations are now using Mater\u2019s SPOT as a hosted solution. \u201cWhen we go out to visit government, state health departments or private organisations we demonstrate not just how the SPOT functionality works in terms of managing students, but also the capability around reporting using Tableau. People are always very impressed by what they see, and surprised at the level of sophistication available,\u201d says Hudson. \u201cIt does exactly what I want in terms of demonstrating its value to people. To quote a potential client after seeing the tool, \u2018SPOT is elegant in its simplicity\u2019 and Tableau has been critical to its sophisticated functionality,\u201d she says Hudson says Mater is looking at other usage models for Tableau. \u201cWe\u2019re now building a new workforce planning tool which draws on our payroll data and uses the SPOT architecture and Tableau. I built our previous workforce planning tool using a big BI tool, but found it was too hard to manage and not responsive enough.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re also encouraging some of the other teams\u2014who do quite a lot of modelling\u2014 to start using Tableau. We expect the number of users to grow. I\u2019m keen for there to be many users so that we can create an expert user group internally. This way I think we\u2019ll get more and more out of it,\u201d Hudson says."

        "content": "Goodwill Education Initiatives of Indiana (Goodwill Education) is a non-profit adult education organization devoted to helping adult learners. Goodwill Education wanted to instill a more data-driven culture in a field that can be \u201cdata-rich but analysis light.\u201d The non-profit\u2019s existing business intelligence tools made that an uphill battle\u2014even standard reporting took a week per location to complete. After choosing Tableau, Goodwill Education has been able to speed compliance reporting, attract educators to data analytics, and identify key offerings that have dramatically improved student graduation rates. Goodwill Education\u2019s former students have earned an estimated additional $9.3 million more in wages and benefits as a result of working with the non-profit. The organization credits Tableau with helping them to fulfill their mission more effectively and efficiently than ever before. Out of the ten schools served by Goodwill Education, nine are Excel Centers; each Excel Center enrolls more than 300 adult learners. In the fall of 2014, Goodwill Education will open its first out-of-state Excel Center in Austin, Texas. Goodwill Education wanted to instill a more data-driven culture in a field that can be \u201cdata-rich but analysis light.\u201d The organization\u2019s existing business intelligence tools made that an uphill battle\u2014even standard reporting took a week per location to complete. Dan Scott, Director of Data Services, Goodwill Education Initiatives of Indiana, was determined to make data analysis easy, fun, and relevant\u2014all to help the organization better serve its adult student population. After choosing Tableau, Scott says that Goodwill Education has been able to triple its course completion rates, cut reporting times by several weeks over its multiple locations, and has even previously data-averse educators performing data analysis on the fly. The non-profit has now expanded its data analysis services to other schools, helping 15 area public schools benefit from truly data-driven decision making. A particular challenge with the adult learning population is that they are shouldering responsibilities and facing difficulties that can complicate their educational efforts. \u201cSometimes their car breaks down or their work schedule changes, or maybe a family member gets sick,\u201d says Dan Scott, Director of Data Services, Goodwill Education Initiatives of Indiana. \u201cThey might be in the middle of term one and they say, \u2018There's too much personal stuff going on, I'll be back in term two.\u2019\" Unfortunately, the organization knows that the overwhelming majority\u201490 percent\u2014of students that become inactive will never return and finish a program. \u201cWe can't let them get to that point,\u201d says Scott. \u201cIf we allow them to quit again on their education, the likelihood is that they are not going to be successful.\u201d Scott and Goodwill Education are dedicated to the idea that education can and should be a data-driven pursuit. But they recognize that there is a long way to go to meet that goal. \u201cOften, schools only collect data because they\u2019re required to report on it. This industry is data rich, but analysis light,\u201d says Scott. Many teachers and administrators could even be described as data-averse, Scott says.\n\u201cWhen you're in school to become an educator, you are taught how to teach. You're not taught how to analyze data to improve,\u201d he says. \u201cSo people can have this adverse reaction to the idea of doing data analysis\u2014because it\u2019s unfamiliar.\u201d But Scott believes strongly that taking the time stop and look at the data can help educators to ensure that they are spending their time most effectively. Initially, Goodwill Education did this by implementing a term review every eight weeks. \u201cWe would analyze everything that happened during the school term\u2014how many credits were earned, retention, things of that nature,\u201d Scott explains. Gathering and looking at the data took approximately a week per school. \u201cThey would literally sit in an office and stay late every day for a week, compiling information after class,\u201d Scott recalls. Using the organization\u2019s existing industry-specific tools, Scott was able to cut that process down to \u201cabout two weeks across five sites.\u201d But that was still too long. And he couldn\u2019t produce the impactful analysis he envisioned. Scott began a search for a new tool and quickly realized that industry-specific data solutions were too limited to meet his needs. \u201cWhether you're using Harmony, PowerSchool, Skyward\u2014any of the major student information systems today\u2014the number-one focus is for state and federal reporting,\u201d says Scott. Flexible analysis was impossible, and getting information out of the systems was \u201ca nightmare,\u201d according to Scott. \u201cWe wanted a tool that could quickly allow us to analyze data across multiple areas,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we wanted to be able to produce a set report, but one that was interactive, so our employees could filter or drill down to answer their own questions.\u201d Scott and his team looked at a number of business intelligence solutions, including Tableau. \u201cWe were impressed right away,\u201d says Scott. \u201cBut Tableau was not the least expensive option. We hoped we could find something else\u2014but we kept coming back to Tableau.\u201d Today, Goodwill Education has 4 employees authoring data dashboards using Tableau Desktop and approximately 200 employees viewing and interacting with the published dashboards on Tableau Server. Most of the data they view in Tableau comes from either the PowerSchool or Harmony student information systems. PowerSchool data is structured and Harmony data is unstructured; Goodwill Education has also implemented a SQL data warehouse that they connect to using Tableau. Each of the organization\u2019s 5,000 student records comprised approximately 10,000 rows of data. \u201cYou have basic student data such as gender or date of birth and then you have records for every single course\u2014typically 30 or 40 courses. It adds up in a hurry,\u201d says Scott. The Special Education department within Goodwill Education takes advantage of the subscription option in Tableau Server to help manage its federally-mandated compliance reporting. Scott estimates that roughly 10-20 percent of employees using Tableau interact with dashboards from a mobile device. \u201cOur superintendent almost always uses Tableau on his tablet because he wants quick answers to things while he's in meetings. So it's just easy for him to pull out his iPad and look it up real quick,\u201d says Scott. Goodwill Education\u2019s adoption of Tableau has expanded outside of its own schools.\n\u201cOnce we had Tableau underway here, our very next thought was \u2018how can we help other schools and give them access to something similar?\u2019\u201d recalls Scott. Today, Goodwill Education is using Tableau to help 15 Indiana schools identify areas for improvement and continues to recruit additional partner schools. The impacts of Goodwill Education\u2019s programs are wide reaching. To date, its former students have earned an estimated additional $9.3 million more in wages and benefits as a result of working with Goodwill Education. Goodwill Education of Indiana was able to identify a factor that had the greatest influence on whether students completed their programs at the schools: Certificate programs. And the non-profit credits Tableau with helping it fulfill its mission more effectively than ever before. Tableau has helped Goodwill Education analyze what student populations they are serving most successfully, which accomplishments have the biggest returns, and they can fulfill state and federal accountability demands more easily. More importantly, Scott can point to three major changes that are having a deep impact on his organization and the students they serve: Overall, Scott feels that Tableau is helping educators\u2014within Goodwill Education and at the schools at which they consult\u2014maximize results. \u201cNow you can put a dashboard in front of someone that basically says: here are the areas you need to focus on and here are the students in those areas you need to be worried about. And the school is going to do a lot better overall\u2014not because anyone's working harder, but because people know where they can get the biggest return on their time and energy,\u201d Scott concludes."

        "content": "GameFly is the number one video game subscription service in the US. Members can choose from more than 8,000 titles for console or handheld gaming systems or select the latest movies available for BluRay and DVD. The analytics team knew they could mine true business value from GameFly\u2019s big data\u2014if only they could find more time to analyze it. After implementing a \u201cmagic solution\u201d of Tableau Software and Cloudera Impala on a Hadoop data warehouse\u2014the team is saving more than 100 hours each week and accelerating insight by weeks. Even better, the team\u2019s near real-time, multichannel insight into customer behavior has led to strategic insights leading to improvements including a 5x increase in new membership trial participation. After a company-wide reorganization in February 2013, the GameFly analytics team found itself inundated with new reporting responsibilities. \u201cAfter the reorganization, our team became responsible for both analytics and reporting\u2014we inherited all of the reporting from the rest of the company,\u201d says Andy Calver, Director of Business Analytics for GameFly. Calver estimates that the team spent 80 percent of its time\u2014or 128 hours each week among the four-person team\u2014 simply running reports for users.\nMost of those hours were spent on the mechanics of gathering data, with very little time left for analysis. \u201cWe probably spent five percent of our time looking at the data before we had to send it off and deal with the next request,\u201d he says. The team began to investigate how to provide GameFly users with real-time insight into the company\u2019s large volume of data. They envisioned a solution that also would allow them to spend more time analyzing the data for business advantages, rather than simply running queries and delivering reports. They decided that their answer would be a data warehouse that would function as the company\u2019s business intelligence repository. On top of that, they envisioned a data visualization tool that would connect directly to the data warehouse and provide fast, intuitive data visualizations directly to business users. The analytics team decided on Cloudera distribution of Hadoop (CDH) for its data warehouse. The next step was to find the business intelligence solution to sit on top. The team considered Tableau 7.0 but assumed it would not work with Hadoop. They were deep into testing other solutions when they gave Tableau a second look. \u201cWe were working with another vendor and kept waiting for them to come up with a solution to connect to Hadoop,\u201d says Calver. \u201cOn a whim, I went back to the website and found the new release\u2014Tableau 8.0.\u201d This release included a number of new native connectors, including Cloudera Impala, Apache Hadoop, Hortonworks, and more. The team downloaded a free trial of Tableau Desktop. \u201cIt worked right out of the box,\u201d says Tom Jankowski, Software Engineer for Data Analytics at GameFly. He recalls that a technical question during the trial period turned into a positive experience for the team. \u201cWe submitted a technical support ticket on the second day of our two-week trial period. And we had our answer within 24 hours. We thought, \u2018Well, these guys are obviously going to support us going forward.\u2019 That was a big, big part of our decision to choose Tableau,\u201d says Jankowski. The team watched free training videos from the website to learn how to use Tableau.\n\u201cIt's really easy to get started. There were so many resources\u2014you can learn the whole program within a week,\u201d says Rich Ung, Analyst for Gamefly. Today, all four members of the analytics team are authoring visualizations using Tableau Desktop. They use Tableau Server to publish their interactive data visualizations. The group uses both data extracts and live data connections for its visualizations. \u201cWe are using Tableau with Hadoop via Impala to analyze hundreds of millions of records in a matter of seconds. It\u2019s so fast,\u201d says Calver. \u201cUsing Tableau to connect Impala has allowed us to have live connections on big data sources. It\u2019s cutting-edge,\u201d Jankowski adds. \u201cThat's the direction we believe everything is going to go. I would consider us early adopters of that kind of architecture,\u201d says Calver. \u201cI can't see a future that doesn\u2019t include something like this\u2014a visualization tool on a powerful database\u2014that allows you to instantly figure out what's going on with your company. You don't have to wait until month-end or year-end to know how you're doing,\u201d says Calver. \u201cIt seems like that's just an inevitable future for all business.\u201d The analytics team is using Tableau, Impala, and Hadoop to create a number of different data analyses for teams within the company. From spot-checking customer recommendation, investigating customer trends and preferences, to identifying channels that result in the best subscribers. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at our data to just generally optimize everything,\u201d says Ung. Teams may use vizzes to see where the company should adjust inventory\u2014 increasing when rental queues hit a certain point or liquidating surplus titles. GameFly also uses vizzes to improve individual customer-level segmentation. \u201cWe build customer profiles so we can see what genre of games they use, their rental frequency,\u201d says Sam Ho, Analyst, Gamefly. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our longer-term goal to develop a complete view of the customer. We\u2019re working on looking at demographics from a regional point of view, things like that. That\u2019s something we\u2019re working towards, definitely,\u201d says Calver. \"If we can figure out how a customer uses their account, we can give them a better overall experience.\" \u201cWe are always digging into the data to determine how effective things are,\u201d he says. \u201cWe take answers to the business teams before they can bring the questions to us.\u201d The team recently created a visualization to understand its customers\u2019 lifetime value. While the team was looking at this data by timeline, they noticed an anomaly. \u201cWe noticed that there was a period of time where that customer group had a much higher total lifetime value,\u201d says Calver. \u201cWhen we dug into that, we saw that was the time in which we offered a 30-day free trial offer.\u201d \u201cWe were able to not only visualize the data, but\u2014once we noticed this\u2014we were able to dig in using Tableau and confirm our suspicions by looking at it ten different ways. And we could do that rapidly because it was a live connection to our data so we could visualize it instantly,\u201d he explains. The team used its visualizations to convince stakeholders to change its previous offer, a 10-day free trial for new subscribers, to the more impactful 30-day free trial offer. The team reintroduced the 30-day offer in the beginning of October. The analytics team at GameFly is seeing a number of benefits from its adoption of Tableau, including: Overall, the team agrees that Tableau\u2014coupled with the Hadoop data warehouse\u2014has incited a culture change across GameFly. \u201cIt\u2019s changing the way that people absorb data,\u201d Calver says. \u201cInstead of coming up with one or two big things to ask the analytics team, they go in and look at all of the little things that they need to know about.\u201d Want to learn more about how Tableau and Hadoop can work together?

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: Tell us a little about Piedmont\u2014how large is the practice?\nMark Jackson, Business Intelligence Manager: Piedmont Healthcare is a five-hospital system. We have 400 employed medical staff members, and we have approximately 1,200 affiliate physicians with more than 100 physician practices across North Georgia. Tableau: Wow, so you must handle a lot of data in your role there! Can you tell us more about that?\nMark: Well, I\u2019ve been with the company now going on four years. I started out with the Heart Institute, which is a cardiovascular service line within the organization. And we started to become a more data-driven organization. I mean, that\u2019s kind of where the industry is going. You have to be able to respond rapidly to changes in the market, with all the changes that are coming in healthcare legislation. So it\u2019s really a requirement for you to be able to adapt. Tableau: Has Tableau helped you with that?\nMark: Well, I just needed a way to do my job quicker, faster, to be able to drive insight. And the first thing that I did with Tableau was to take what I was doing in Excel\u2014a project with our catheterization (\u201ccath\u201d) and electrophysiology (EP) labs\u2014and use Tableau to track the throughput for those labs. I first started doing all this in Excel, which was taking me four hours a month\u2014and could only be produced as information in aggregate, and always led to more questions and more work. Tableau really enabled me to fully automate that process. Now it runs itself. Tableau: That\u2019s great! So what happened next?\nMark: Well, as I continued to develop the work that I was doing, transitioning a lot of what I previously did in Excel to Tableau, I got recognized by corporate. And they said, \"Okay, we're struggling with the same problems. We've got to be able to deliver this insight faster. We can't get the information to the decision-makers quick enough for us to be able to rapidly change in this environment.\" They had these books that they would print out. They were monthly operating reports, and they were 133 pages long\u2014and they produced one of those for every hospital. So by the time they reached the decision-makers\u2019 hands, they were out of date. Using Tableau, we were essentially able to replace 2,400 pages with a single dashboard. Tableau: Wow! And have you built other dashboards since then?\nMark: Yes. The second project that we did with Tableau was this project called Patient First. And the first phase of that project was about reorganizing physician schedules. We had more than 100 physicians and mid-level extenders and we needed to reorganize their entire day. We had them basically spread out doing many different things, creating some inefficiencies. We leveraged Tableau to help us reorganize those schedules. And one of the effects of that was that we were able to cut out a third-party physician-consulting service and some additional third-party work that was being done on the weekends. That, in total, saved us a little over $2 million a year. Tableau: That\u2019s great. Has that impacted quality of care?\nMark: We\u2019ve seen some real benefits from the Patient First project that we did, which allowed the physicians to really focus all their attention on one patient-centered activity at a time. We\u2019ve seen a 50-percent improvement in our variance from benchmark in cardiovascular length of stay. We\u2019ve also seen a 10-percent reduction in heart failure readmissions, and we\u2019ve seen a 12-percent reduction in readmissions for patients who are heart attack victims. And overall, that\u2019s improved our patient satisfaction scores by 7 percent. In addition to helping us setup the new physician schedules, Tableau has helped us track the results of our efforts for all phases of Patient First. Tableau: That\u2019s amazing! Are you using Tableau in any clinical spaces?\nMark: One of the cool things that we are doing is that we mine our imaging system for a certain set of criteria that makes somebody a good candidate for valve surgery. We can find potential candidates and talk to the person who ordered the imaging study, who can go back to their patient and say, \u201cHey, you might want to come in and see our vascular surgeon. You might benefit from a certain procedure.\u201d That's the kind of care that I want to know I'm getting when I'm going into any hospital system\u2014that I'm not going to fall through the cracks, and they're not going to miss something, because people are on the back end doing smart things with all the information that they're collecting about me. Tableau: Absolutely! So how many Piedmont employees use Tableau?\nMark: Well, with Tableau getting its start in the Heart Institute, we have several people in that entity who are pretty well-versed in it and doing lots of creative things. We have users in every entity and most departments at this point. So from one original license, we\u2019re up to 85 licenses and we have a 16-core server implemented and about 250 unique users every week. Tableau: Do people like the self-service aspect of Tableau?\nMark: Self-service has been a big buzzword in the BI space right now\u2014and we\u2019re definitely taking advantage of that. What Tableau has allowed us to do is take what used to require this huge back office to maintain\u2014this huge, lumbering BI infrastructure with these giant data warehouse projects that might take a year to complete\u2014and our speed is so much faster. We can rapidly deploy these small data marts and put them in the hands of the end users who are facing the problems individually. And as we continue to develop with this project, I think people are going to be more and more completely self-reliant. So it\u2019s not been a top-down mandate where people have to use this. People are genuinely excited about it. And it\u2019s all grown organically. We\u2019ve given out a few licenses just to groups that we thought would be interested in it. And from there, people are doing their job more efficiently. Tableau: Can you tell us more?\nMark: Well, I sent out a survey recently and the results tell me that, on average, people have seen a 23-percent improvement in their efficiency. If you extrapolate and assign an hourly rate to those resources, looking at the amount of hours that they spend per week working on those things, that\u2019s about $250,000 to $650,000 that we\u2019ve reallocated. One of the best success stories was a user in our IT department who automated work that used to take her 3.5 weeks per month when she did it all in Excel. We recreated those reports in Tableau and now she maybe spends 3 days per month on it and has time to focus on her new role instead of running reports every month. Tableau: How about you?\nMark: Personally, I can say I\u2019ve increased my efficiency probably 80 to 90 percent\u2014and that\u2019s just time to initial insight. Because what Tableau enables you to do is fully automate that insight going forward. So all the insight maintenance work that I would do throughout the year, well, I don\u2019t have to do anymore. It\u2019s amazing now when I look at the amount of data that we\u2019re pushing through Tableau. We have more than 70 data sources that we\u2019re publishing to the server right now. And so I started taking the columns and the rows that we have, and it\u2019s more than 20 billion points of data that we push through Tableau every day. So it\u2019s this massive amount of information, but honestly, it just doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s that big. Tableau makes me feel empowered, like there\u2019s nothing that I can\u2019t really accomplish here. I can take any problem, and as long as the data is available, we can solve it. And probably pretty quickly too."

        "content": "Tableau: World Wide Technologies has implemented Tableau across the company\u2014how were you able to get the company to embrace Tableau as it has?\nLance Leonard, Operations Manager, Professional Services: In the middle of 2012 we were delivering a financial presentation to our executives. And so our president, our CEO and CFO were all in the room with us. And we're talking finances, and we have four dashboards that we're walking through and telling the story. And our president calls time out at about 15 minutes into the conversation and says, \"Where is this data coming from, and what is the tool you're using,\" and we spent the rest of the time really talking about Tableau and what a difference it had made for us in Professional Services. And so right away we had that executive sponsorship. Tableau: That\u2019s great to hear! And have you gotten that same positive reaction from other parts of the company?\nLance: From the executives being our biggest fans, if you will, it was really easy to start that adoption process through the rest of the organization. And so now the rest of the folks when they get in there and look at the dashboards, obviously they're intrigued by the visuals and they're intrigued by what we're seeing. And so then it becomes a question of how do I affect that data. And so it becomes a behavior change conversation as well, too, so that they know where the data is coming, most importantly they know that somebody is doing something with it. Tableau: Can you give me an example of how you\u2019re sharing data among your colleagues using Tableau?\nLance: One of the coolest things that I've seen is when the head of Professional Services actually stands in front of a green screen and does a video with Tableau in the background. So he's showing the dashboards for the whole organization and putting a video out for everybody to see. Tableau: Can you describe the impact of this change\u2014not just understanding the data, but what sounds like a cultural shift in how people are relating to data?\nLance: Now we can step back and look at the big picture and provide insight into lessons learned on closed projects, find issues before they happen, and try to prevent losing money\u2014putting a true dollar impact on the business has really been helpful. Tableau: What\u2019s the most exciting thing you\u2019ve seen\u2014in your opinion\u2014about how you\u2019re using Tableau at WWT?\nLance: From a business perspective absolutely we are looking at data differently, because where previously they are answering the questions we're telling them to ask. But with Tableau and the ability to blend all that disparate data together and more of a self-service BI approach that they can really answer their own questions. It's turned into an education as well around what are our KPIs for our business, and what are the questions that our business really cares about so that we can enable them to make the decisions that they need to make. That\u2019s really the exciting piece for me, that we're making a difference in the organization and making an impact. Tableau: That\u2019s great! It sounds like you\u2019re really able to use Tableau to help people understand what\u2019s going on in your business.\nLance: The business users talk about our business in many ways, whether it's regionally focused or practice or technology focused. Having the ability to carve up that information in multiple ways and be able to tell that story of a project\u2014from the time it was an opportunity in the sales department to the time we close it in Professional Services, with all the hardware and the future opportunities attached to that customer\u2014all in one place. It really gets people excited about the information."

It's a money pit. We throw money in there just because we have to. It's a necessary evil. Being able to have a strong HR analytics function within an organization allows you to not only show that HR is not just a cost center, but they can actually improve the bottom line and add value in ways that you didn't think was possible. Tableau: Sometimes people think of HR as being a \u201csoft skills\u201d department and not so data-driven. How can analytics be applied to the HR function of a company?\nMichael: HR analytics can be used in an HR department in so many ways because there is so much data within human resources. We can take all of these little pieces of data and use them to build a business case for our HR initiatives. If we are able to show that by having a Christmas bonus every year increases employee engagement and reduces turnover\u2014that's great, but how much does that bring to the bottom line? That is the problem that HR has always been struggling with. We\u2019re able to bunch all of that data together within Tableau and break it down into small pieces so that we're actually able to analyze it and say, \u2018This person applied after this person (but) this person received an interview before this person. Why?\u2019 And is there something that we need to be doing in our recruiting process to ensure that we're receiving the best candidates? Tableau: And you can use Tableau to help with that?\nMichael: Tableau allows us to not only break that up, but for HR leaders, the recruitment leaders, they're able to look at the whole scale of recruitment. And then they're able to pinpoint, okay, I want to know about this specific recruiter and how they're doing and how effective they are. Tableau allows you to slice the data in a lot of different ways, but also drill down to something that is specific and meaningful for that -- that leader to actually take and apply to somebody. it's cutting edge and it's really cool."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "The Taiwan Institute for Information Industry (III) is a non-government organization focused on driving the advancement of information and communication technology (ICT) sector and building an information-rich society. The institute emphasizes cross-disciplinary environment, university-industry collaborations and techno-cultural co-development. It also plays a key role in helping domestic industries within Taiwan be more competitive and supports the local ICT industry with advanced technologies and international links. Serving as a think tank on ICT policy and consultant to the government, III is regarded as a source of vision, innovation and technological excellence. Taiwan has one of the highest rates of Internet penetration in the world. Nearly 82.5 percent of Taiwanese households have Internet access. Internet users in Taiwan are also very active on social media, with over 63 percent of Taiwanese maintaining social media profiles. This is just a glimpse of the Internet and social media landscape in Taiwan from III\u2019s research. Behind all these information is William Shyu, section manager and his team of more than 10 researchers at Foreseeing Innovative New Digiservices (FIND) at III. The team dives into large amount of data, and using Tableau, extracts interesting patterns and trends, and presents an analytical view of behavioral trends and lifestyle preferences among social media users. The team also connects to Google analytics to discover web traffic and Internet usage trends. Through the research, the III-FIND team aims to understand which social media sites are popular with Taiwanese, and what activities they use these sites for. Incidentally, Taiwan has 14 million active Facebook users in a typical month making it the biggest Facebook user base in Asia, according to Central News Agency in Taiwan in a September 2013 report. The III-FIND research is an invaluable resource for many business owners and marketers who are trying to connect with Taiwanese consumers online. The findings allow them to make informed decisions and plan their offerings and promotions accordingly. \u201cFrom the Tableau visualizations, we are able to see spikes and troughs, and by connecting the dots, we are able to gain an understanding of preferences of social media users,\" explained Shyu. \u201cBusinesses are then able to see from our reports what works and what doesn\u2019t, and plan their products, services and activities accordingly,\u201d he added. Generally, III-FIND offers a macro view of the social media scene in Taiwan. For example, according to their research, more than two thirds of Taiwanese are prepared to spend a significant amount of time on social media to find out about the reputation of products or services that they are considering or purchasing. More than half of them, or 50.3 percent, would share their experience with others on a social media site once they have purchased the item. Shyu commented: \u201cWe believe it is better to present our findings in a visual manner as visualization helps people better understand the results. Most likely, we would need to have a computer programmer help us create the visual presentations if not for Tableau. The III-FIND team is made up of researchers and we don\u2019t have anyone with the programming skill sets.\u201d At any time, the III-FIND team may be going through a few gigabytes of data. They present their findings in charts, diagrams, tables, etc. using Tableau. These are then exported on to slides for easy presentation to III management, industry audience or the general public. Very often, over 100 different visualizations are used in one report. Different information would be presented using different kinds of charts or diagrams to best bring the point across. \u201cTableau helps us deliver our findings with visual impact, and it allows us to come up with impressive presentations in a very short time,\u201d said Shyu. \u201cCompared to using a traditional spreadsheet or visualization tools, Tableau saves us about half the time and we get the same or better results. Coworkers from other departments have been asking me what tool are we using and how did we get such impressive visuals,\u201d he added with a laugh. Furthermore, III-FIND uses Tableau to \u2018explore\u2019 data. As Tableau allows users to retrace their steps, users can freely explore different approaches with the same set of data. Shyu\u2019s team often looks at the same data set from different perspectives without determining beforehand what they are searching for. They switch from one visualization to another in a matter of seconds, and the process often helps to reveal surprisingly interesting findings and insights. When asked what recommendations he has for people who are first experiencing Tableau, Shyu said that that it was best for someone to first familiarize himself with the tool and its interface as it is different from most traditional tools. He added that once the person is past the initial phase, he will find Tableau to be a powerful tool that can help him achieve much. He also said that Tableau is suitable for anyone with data to analyze. Moving forward, the III-FIND team plans to dig deeper to understand the Taiwanese social media psyche. The team will also be taking on more special assignments, working with different commercial companies, and doing targeted research to cater to specific needs and requirements."

In this video, Eric Rynerson, Director of Analytics, Product Management for InsideTrack, talks about how he uses Tableau to get people excited about answering their own questions through data. Tableau: Can you tell us a little bit about InsideTrack\u2019s data and what you\u2019re doing with it?\nEric Rynerson, Director of Analytics, Product Management: Well, we have a lot of data. We have a lot of data about students. We have a lot of data about our coaching activity with students. And we have a lot of data about students' progress in school, which is really the point of all the work we do. And so we needed to be able to really explore the data and really just see what's happening. And that's something that is hard to do with other tools. And so when I found Tableau, it was very clear that I found something that was going to give us a lot of freedom that we wouldn't have and allow us to really get a feel for the data. Most of our data is on a SQL Server. We also have other sources\u2014everything from Survey Monkey to Salesforce to the usual wild thicket of spreadsheets. We connect to all of it. One of the big things we want to understand is where is our impact concentrated? And so that feeds everything from day-to-day insights to predictive models that we build. And then we use Tableau as well to make sure that the predictive models are actually scoring students correctly. Tableau: InsideTrack is using Tableau to share data with educational coaches and others within your company. In your opinion, what\u2019s the benefit of enabling this self-service data exploration?\nEric Rynerson, Director of Analytics, Product Management: I don't want it to just be: Analyst does some work. Analyst tells people about the data. Somebody asks a question\u2014Well, what time can you meet next week? I'll bring some more slides. (With Tableau) It's\u2014let's just talk about it right now. And then you're going to go and find things out when I'm working on something else. Frankly, you're going to be making progress. InsideTrack uses Tableau to understand and communicate important information such as students\u2019 testing patterns Tableau: Sometimes people can be surprised to discover that analyzing data in Tableau is actually fun. What\u2019s the benefit of making data exploration fun? Eric: The thing about Tableau being fun is that\u2014it's not just that it\u2019s more enjoyable to do your day-to-day job. It\u2019s that it attracts more people to the data. And when people actually like interacting with the data, they engage in it. They show up for the beautiful visualization, but they stay for the insight. So what you really want to do is get people \u2018addicted\u2019 to the data by making it interactive, making it fun, allowing them to find things on their own. We want people to engage with data, and when it's fun to engage with data, people do it. And the more you engage with data, the more your data quality improves, the more people ask the right questions. It\u2019s a virtuous cycle. The reality is (that) people only have so much time in a day. So it's not just that you save time\u2014you actually do things you wouldn't have done."

In this video, Nayeem Ahmed, Director of Technical Solutions at Tantus, talks about how he is using Tableau to help customers like the FAA better see and understand their data. Tableau: Can you describe what Tantus does? What services do you provide to Federal agencies?\nNayeem Ahmed, Director of Technical Solutions: We focus mostly on the public sector, working a lot with government clients. As an example, we work with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). We are sort of the IT organization within the FAA. We do some work at HHS, the Health and Human Services. We're also in other agencies. Tableau: And you, specifically? What services are you providing?\nNayeem: I'm a problem solver. So my job is really to go talk to customers and understand what is it in their business process they're having trouble with or where the challenges are or the pain points. Tableau: And what were the challenges at the FAA?\nNayeem: What FAA was doing was tracking really millions of dollars in reimbursable projects using traditional means by querying the financial system. But what they lacked was the ability to provide a lot of the information into one solution to get the big picture.\nWe developed a dashboard in Tableau that really provided the means to see the overall health of the program and know where to focus. Tableau: Can you describe process of developing dashboards for the FAA? Both before Tableau and now?\nNayeem: It would take us, perhaps, weeks to develop a report to get out to the customers. It was more of, you know, \u2018Let me get back to you when I have a product I can show you.\u2019 Whereas with Tableau, we were able to adopt a different model, do more of an agile development, more collaboration with the customers and they would sit with us and they would look at the dashboards and be able to provide feedback. We were able to just respond a lot quicker to that. And then, at the end, you get a product that's a little bit more suited for what they were looking for. Tableau: When I hear \u201cFederal government contractor\u201d I immediately think \u201csecurity.\u201d How did you handle that in Tableau?\nNayeem: Security is a big deal for any government agencies. And there is also a mandate to move away from having separate IDs for different systems and really consolidate that under one ID. With security, the way we have implemented the solution with Tableau for our customers is that you have this one ID that you can use to get into the system, and then we've been able to manage security behind the scenes. And it's all tied to the level of access they have\u2014 the type of privilege they have \u2014and it ensures that the proper authorization is in place from the system owners. Tableau: What is different about Tableau, compared with other data insight solutions?\nNayeem: I think it's just more intuitive and fun just to figure it out, to get what you want. But really just the ease of development was probably the biggest one for me. Traditionally, you know, organizations tend to bucket users based on the type of information they need. So you could have an executive that's looking at something different from, say, the managers or even the analysts. I think Tableau bridges the gap a little bit where you could really just use the tool and\u2014if you build the dashboards where you have an executive summary \u2014you provide the ability to drill down with additional tabs. So it can really just be used across the board. Tableau: How are your clients responding to the work you\u2019re delivering in Tableau?\nNayeem: With Tableau, specifically, what we've seen at the FAA is\u2014you don't really need to market it. It's one of those things where, you know, people are hungry to get answers to questions they have. We've seen a very positive reaction and they are anxious to see this new platform as a service that provides them the ability to be more in control of their analytic products. So I think we're getting really good reaction. I think that's the exciting part, being able to just know that at the end of the day, you might have provided a tool that could make a material difference in their jobs. Tableau: That\u2019s fantastic. Any thoughts you\u2019d like to share with people considering Tableau?\nNayeem: Be prepared, really, for data discovery when you use Tableau. I think it is amazing how as you get answers to questions that you were not getting before, it will completely change your perspective. I've been doing business intelligence for a lot of years. And it truly is a tool that allows the analyst or the super user the ability to have more control at their fingertips as long as the data sets are in good shape. And to be able to answer the question of the day, which traditionally took a lot longer before."

Our organization partners with other organizations in the community to implement teen pregnancy prevention programs and educate community members and organizations to prevent teen pregnancy. We monitor knowledge of different contraceptive methods with teens as they come in the clinics that we partner with. We ask them certain questions about how aware they are different methods. And so we're able to use that data to sort of get a baseline of, you know, \u2018How aware are these teens of these long-acting reversible contraceptive methods\u2014which we call in our field LARC.\u2019 Tableau: What were you doing with your data prior to finding Tableau?\nJordan: We had forced Excel to build these dashboards. And we had maxed out our capacity with what Excel could do. We've been able to import our data into Tableau and build much prettier dashboards where we're able to interact with the data. Where before it was static and we just had to print them and use them as handouts, which wasn't as fun and didn't let us really dig into the data and see the patterns. Tableau: What is the benefit of visualizing this sort of data in Tableau?\nJordan: The benefit to being able to track those patterns using Tableau and being able to filter contraceptive methods by age and race using Tableau has allowed us to really validate what these teens know and be able to move these sexually active teens onto more reliable methods. We've had a lot of opportunities to present the data in Tableau with grants, especially with the clinic data. We definitely have a heightened sense of engagement with the data at our organization. Tableau: What sort of effects are you seeing from the move to Tableau? Jordan: Tableau's really sped up the understanding of our data with our internal team. We've had a lot of \u2018ah-hah\u2019 moments and meetings with the staff and we're presenting these like we really haven't had before. I'll stand presenting in front of the staff and interact with the data with them and they'll ask me different filters and show them different ways to look at it. And we can do that in a meeting and all make a decision together. It's not me going back to my desk and having to root through and try to answer different questions. I'm able to do that right then so that we can continue to make decisions and speed up the impact on our communities and being able to lower the impact of teen pregnancy in South Carolina. It has really engaged a lot of our team members at a higher level with the data."

Over the last ten years, with the advent of the Internet, the advent of social media, we now have screens in front of us at all times. We get inundated with these data messages. And those messages can lead us to making really bad health choices. So we want to study that data, harness that data, and use it to make people healthier. Tableau: If I\u2019m new to analyzing social data, what should I keep in mind? Any tips for working with social data in Tableau?\nGlen: The first thing you need to realize is social data is dirty data. And just because you use a key word, you can't assume that your question that you're asking is going to be contained in a tweet. You need to know that the tweet you're looking at is the behavior that you're trying to study. So you really need to clean your social media data before you even put it into Tableau. With the front end of a tweet, there are about four sources of information that you can get. But at the back end of a tweet, there could be 20 to 25 different types of metadata. And Tableau is great with tweets. You get longitudinal, latitudinal data. And Tableau works great with that. You can map out where the tweets are into these great cluster circles. It works very well with the metadata variables on the backside of a tweet. Tableau: What sort of data are you looking at?\nGlen: We collect from a variety of social media platforms, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, You Tube, and WordPress. Our next platform is Foursquare. And Foursquare is all about geolocation, so we're really excited about working with that. It's a rapidly-changing environment for social data. New platforms are available. Anytime they become available, we try to to collect data there. Tableau: And how are you using Tableau with this social data?\nGlen: A lot of our grant funders\u2014the CDC, the National Cancer Institute\u2014 they're able to see the graphs. They want quick answers. They don't want to read a 20-page or 30-page report, they just want to see that graph, be able to look at it, and with some quick points, understand it. Tableau: Can you give us an example of the sort of insight you\u2019re able to gain by visualizing social data.\nGlen: We're doing this analysis on people talking about quitting smoking on Twitter. So we took a year and charted it out on a histogram. And you could see the peaks. We're telling those tobacco control organizations, \u2018This might be a good time to reach out to these people.\u2019 They can effectively use their resources by looking at the behavior of Twitter users. Tableau: What is the value of visualizing social data?\nGlen: The value is the insight. It's the insight that when you look at a graph. You get an immediate response to taking 1.7 million tweets and sticking it on a histogram and charting it weekly to see where the peaks are. It just pops out at them. And I'm big about making things look good. I think it really matters. That might be vain in a way, but I think the way you present your data really matters."

From its inception, Marico has worked outside the box to bring innovation to its customers through the careful creation of continuous and sustainable change. Marico\u2019s head office is based in Mumbai. The company recorded operating revenues of US$851 million in its most recent financial results. Marico is currently present in more than 25 countries across Asia and Africa. Its vast portfolio of brands, such as Parachute Advansed, Saffola, Hair & Care, Nihar, Mediker, Revive and Manjal, are leading household names today. Additionally, the company recently acquired the personal care business from Reckitt Benckiser and now owns popular brands like Set Wet, Livon and Zatak. India is one of the most exciting consumer markets in the world. An expanding middle class population with rising average income and increasing spending power, coupled with rapid urbanization, have galvanized India\u2019s consumption story. Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), with a market size of over US$13.1 billion as of 2012, has been identified as the fourth largest sector in India\u2019s economy. Companies are constantly fine tuning their strategies and offerings to please the Indian tastes and preferences. Many are diligently tracking consumer shopping and purchase behavior and monitoring product movement across regions. Marico depended on daily sales reporting that the staff would prepare and email to senior management. These reports offered little flexibility and management was not impressed as they could only get few insights out of them. Lack of standardization and inaccuracies also plagued these manually created reports. \u201cHaving sales performance information readily available on a daily basis was a challenge, especially for top management,\u201d Karan Shah, Business Analytics Manager at Marico India explained. \u201cOur peers wanted the information presented in certain kinds of formats, with pre-fabricated analysis looking at different KPIs.\u201d Karan and his team then looked into finding a business intelligence solution that would help the company leverage the sales data in a more effective manner. \u201cWhen I joined Marico in 2012, one of the first things I wanted to look at was to develop a holistic business intelligence layer that would serve the entire organization in a comprehensive manner,\u201d Karan elaborated. \u201cAfter coming across Tableau and another product in the market, I worked with my team to conduct a thorough analysis of what would be possible with both tools \u2013 including the type of analysis generated, the creation process, how easy it would be for end-users to consume the information, etc. Tableau stood out strongly as the product that was most suited for the kind of work we were intending to embark on, due to the high quality of its default visualizations and a highly rewarding data discovery approach.\u201d Today, Karan and his team of four use Tableau to analyze a large amount of data on retail behavior, sales and marketing, inventory movement, procurement of key inputs, etc., gaining detailed insights into the company\u2019s performance. They present the visualized data to teams from various departments in the company, and this has helped drive a change management initiative to provide easy-to-consume and highly customized dashboards/reports (updated with the latest data) to the company\u2019s decision-makers and management. The various department managers gain access to business insights via Tableau Server, retrieving key information on sales, customers and products from their desktops or on-the-go via their mobiles and tablets. With Tableau deployed, Marico now has standardized reports in a clean PDF format and customized dashboards with vizzes reflecting all manner of KPIs for managers to get the insights they need out of the data. In addition to the ease of reporting, Tableau has also offered Marico significant cost savings. Marico has invested tens of thousands of dollars in Tableau, as compared to hundreds of thousands of dollars of investment in traditional business intelligence (BI). To-date, Marico has yet to spend a single dollar on additional consultation or implementation costs on Tableau, which is a testament to Tableau\u2019s ease-of-use in both personal and enterprise scenarios. Karan shared that the Tableau reports have become so embedded within the organization that his team would get calls and messages from their colleagues asking for the reports if they do not see it in their mailboxes at the start of each day. He believes the data-driven culture that Marico is heading towards has been given a great boost by the extremely end-user and data analyst friendly features of Tableau. Karan sums up the biggest impact the company has gained from using Tableau: \u201cTo be able to look at any data and immediately analyze and gain some insights from it is pretty amazing. What Tableau allows you to do is to create analysis as fast as you can think about the analysis itself.\u201d Marico business managers now save about 5 to 20 man-hours per month, per analytical report. They have also developed and deployed more than 40 reports and dashboards since implementing Tableau in 2013. Karan\u2019s team can now provide detailed reports and dashboards on a daily basis, which was not possible previously. \u201cPreviously, a lot of the reports we had been building were static,\u201d elaborates Karan. \u201cWe are now able to build something much more interactive to let users choose the analysis they want.\u201d Marico plans to deploy Tableau in other geographies and utilize the software across the entire organization within the next 12 to 16 months. Girish Rao, Head of IT & Business Analytics at Marico India shares that Tableau is a tool that the company plans to invest in for the long-term. \u201cThe kind of work we have produced with Tableau has been very well-received by both our peers and management within Marico. Tableau has also consistently released regular updates to its software and this reaffirms my faith in a company which is willing to be innovative and willing to invest in their product for its customers.\u201d"

        "content": "One of the largest US federal agencies wanted to use its data for a noble mission: to support America\u2019s veterans. After bringing in Tableau, agency leaders saved taxpayer dollars while improving outreach efforts through better decision making and more impactful communication. Click anywhere in the image to view and interact with this visualization.   \u201cThey also earn certain benefits and services that can make a real difference in their lives and the lives of their families. The problem is that less than half of veterans access their benefits. In fact, polls indicate that 59% of veterans know little to nothing about the benefits they may have earned.\u201d Sowers was determined to tackle this lack of awareness. Under Sowers\u2019 leadership, the VA launched its first national outreach campaign in September of 2013. The agency\u2019s media consultancy recommended that the agency purchase advertising time in the top 20 markets. But no one could point to definitive metrics to back up that recommendation. Dr. Sowers knew that to be successful, the campaign would need to be not only effective but also capable of standing up to external scrutiny for wise use of taxpayer dollars. \u201cI wanted to know for certain that these markets were the right ones to reach our veterans,\u201d says Sowers. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to rely on instinct or \u2018how things had always been done.\u2019\u201d Dr. Sowers and his team turned to Tableau Software for answers. Dr. Sowers viewed the instructional videos on the Tableau website. \u201cI learned Tableau\u2019s functionality over a weekend,\u201d he says. His team then obtained data from the IT team in Excel format, which they then visualized in Tableau. For example, the team used Tableau to map out counties with veteran populations greater than 50,000. They then blended in benefits utilization rate data, to identify areas with higher veteran populations but low benefits usage. \u201cWe were quickly able to see that the top 20 media markets would not be the best choice for airing the ads,\u201d says Dr. Sowers. \u201cTableau gave us the information we needed to better appropriate our budget dollars and target our outreach effort.\u201d After the success of the outreach campaign, Dr. Sowers\u2019 office looked for other ways to drive data-driven decision-making. His office spent a great deal of time putting together reports to share expenditure information. For example, decision makers needed to see expenditures on benefits\u2014such as compensation, pensions, educational/vocational rehabilitation employment services, and medical care\u2014broken down by the state and county-level. Another commonly requested view was spending per VA patient by state and county. In the past, even once the required data was compiled and analyzed, Dr. Sowers was not fully satisfied. The reports lacked the interactivity that would allow decision makers to answer questions on the fly. And dry tables of comparative expenditures by county and veteran population were simply not as impactful as Dr. Sowers wished. Instead, the team used Tableau to create a map of veteran benefit expenditures that can be viewed by state or county\u2014and even by expenditure per veteran. Now legislators can quickly see how their state compares with others in terms of supporting their veteran populations. \u201cWhen you can just glance at a Tableau map and discern exactly how your state\u2019s spending on veteran benefits, by program, compares with those of the other 49 states\u2014that\u2019s a powerful tool to bring into these conversations,\u201d says Dr. Sowers. The agency can share maps on its website to make this information available to the public. They are also using Tableau visualizations to support its new outreach program. Users will be able to view the representatives\u2019 tour schedule. In addition to these uses, the agency enjoyed a number of other benefits from its adoption of Tableau, including: "

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Based in New Zealand, Silver Fern Farms is a processor, marketer and exporter of premium quality lamb, beef, venison and associated products to more than 60 countries around the globe. The company needed a solution that could easily show not only the percentage of animals that weren\u2019t high enough quality, but also a canvassing tool to identify potential new suppliers. And they wanted to select a tool that would be readily adopted by internal users. Representing more than 16,000 sheep, cattle and deer farmer-shareholders throughout New Zealand, Silver Fern Farms owns and operates 22 processing sites nationally. The company\u2019s annual revenues are close to NZ$2 billion. As one of New Zealand\u2019s largest employers, Silver Fern Farms has over 7,000 staff working across the country during peak season. While the organisation was already tapping into a large network of farmers, it was looking to identify new suppliers. \u201cWe have approximately 100 field workers that drive to the farms and procure animals for us,\u201d says Aaron Hall, Business Analyst at Silver Fern Farms. \u201cWith 16,000 suppliers, we have a very large reach.\u201d However, the company knew that there were still more potential suppliers out there\u2014but where? Cowan wanted a business intelligence (BI) solution that would help with prospecting. Silver Fern Farms had always been aware of market share and competitors, but it needed a way to expand its network of suppliers in an efficient and profitable way. \u201cIn the office, we are pretty much a top-to-bottom Microsoft shop,\u201d says Stewart Cowan, Enterprise Systems Manager at Silver Fern Farms. \u201cFour years ago, we noticed there was a real gap in the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack around specialisation in representing data in an appealing way, while being super easy to build.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to fill that gap because we could see the power of making attractive visualisations to share with our leadership team and senior managers,\u201d explains Cowan. \u201cWe were introduced to Tableau through our partner Montage around four years ago,\u201d explains Cowan. \u201cAt the time, Montage was advising us on our whole data warehouse and BI strategy. The team there suggested we check out Tableau to bridge the gap in our BI stack.\u201d Montage handled the initial implementation of Tableau Desktop for five licenses and Tableau Server within Silver Fern Farms. Four years later, the company had 14 Tableau Desktop licenses that can be used to author interactive data visualisations. \u201cOur Tableau Server now has 60 interactor licenses that are available to all executives and senior managers at Silver Fern Farms,\u201d says Cowan. \u201cVisualisations are embedded within SharePoint pages in the company\u2019s \u2018HomeBlock\u2019 intranet portal for easy access to Tableau visualisations within the wider context of collaboration and performance management.\u201d \u201cWe use a variety of data sources that have up to 60 million rows,\u201d says James Mahoney, Business Intelligence Architect at Silver Fern Farms. \u201cGenerally, our main source of information is our data warehouse. We then add geospatial information that we procure from a different area.\u201d Initially, Tableau was mainly installed and used by employees in the livestock procurement department. \u201cBecause of the dashboards Tableau allows us to create, our data becomes visual. It\u2019s all laid out on a map,\u201d adds Cowan. \u201cWe can look at a particular region and quickly see the patches of farmland that don\u2019t currently supply to us.\u201d \u201cBefore using Tableau, our field teams were driving past farms for years not realising they were potential suppliers,\u201d says Cowan. \u201cBut now that we have the information visually represented on a map, it\u2019s very clear to pinpoint new suppliers we can approach. And we can also see which farms supply to our competitors and more easily target them.\u201d \u201cSince gaining access to this data through an intuitive visualisation, we have seen tangible gains in market share,\u201d explains Cowan Visualising procurement data worked so well that Silver Fern Farms has expanded its use of Tableau into other areas of the business. \u201cNow, we use it across a variety of departments from sales, finance right through to corporate,\u201d says Cowan. \u201cIt\u2019s really the slice and dice feature that\u2019s been most useful for analysts in our organisation.\u201d \u201cOur analysts can quickly manipulate data in ways that are a lot more useful to them than working with pivot tables or Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services reports,\u201d says Hall. \u201cTableau has proven to be really useful to create dashboards on the fly and show people particular visualisations on the spot.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a tool that our employees get pretty excited about when they look at our visualisations,\u201d explains Hall. \u201cThey might not get so excited about our reports if they were presented in a pivot table!\u201d \u201cBut when we do put interesting visualisations in front of them, they seem to engage more with those dashboards and reports,\u201d says Hall. \u201cThey need virtually zero training,\u201d says Cowan. \u201cWe give them the viz and as long as it\u2019s designed correctly, Tableau takes care of the rest. It\u2019s just very intuitive.\u201d \u201cOur senior management team also use Tableau to create geographical and visual representations of customer claims,\u201d says Mahoney. Claims are made by customers when they receive and reconcile deliveries from Silver Fern Farms suppliers that differ from their initial order. Since implementing Tableau, the team has access to a clear overview of discrepancies in orders. \u201cThis information was previously only available via detailed line-by-line reports which were often lengthy to process and analyse,\u201d explains Mahoney. \u201cTableau now provides the team with a quick and easy comparative analysis between plants and animal types.\u201d For Silver Fern Farms, ease of use and stunning visuals are the main factors that drive Tableau\u2019s user adoption within the organisation. When comparing Tableau to representing data in tabular format, Cowan explains; \u201cif you present exactly the same information in two different ways, you can get vastly different levels of engagement.\u201d \u201cFor me there\u2019s two key value points for Tableau. One is how effortless it is to design and build the dashboards,\u201d says Cowan. \u201cThe other side that\u2019s a selling point for me is just the general sexiness of the resulting dashboards.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that if something looks great, people are much more likely to adopt it,\u201d he says. \u201cTableau has really made a difference in our ability to prospect and increase our market share of available livestock supply,\u201d says Cowan. \u201cIt\u2019s added significant value to our business.\u201d"

        "content": "Advocate Health Care, one of the nation\u2019s top ten health systems, was experiencing lower than expected physician compliance with their Electronic Medical Records. Delivering insights through data visualization empowered the hospital staff to obtain easy access to pared-down information, making the necessary process and policy changes to improve patient care. Advocate Health Care is the largest health system in Illinois and one of the top ten largest healthcare systems in the country. In the healthcare system, whenever a provider initiates care for a patient\u2014such as an X-ray, lab test, or prescription\u2014an order is placed. After decades of providers scribbling down care orders by hand, many healthcare systems have made the shift to computerized provider order entry (CPOE), which has proven to eliminate errors, standardize care, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. To provide the best patient care and exceed regulatory standards, Advocate needed to maximize its investment in its Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. Doing so meant increasing CPOE compliance to better than 80% and eliminating order entry errors entirely. After a concentrated effort on user adoption resulted in little change, Advocate enlisted Slalom\u2019s Information Management and Analytics expertise to conduct a data deep-dive and develop a strategy for CPOE compliance improvement. Together, Slalom and Advocate decided to focus the initial analysis on just one of Advocate\u2019s 12 hospitals. Slalom started by pulling millions of rows of raw data and visualizing it in Tableau. Immediately, the Advocate Clinical Informaticists were able to recognize trends\u2014with unexpected results. Our deep data analysis revealed that existing processes had been negatively impacting Advocate\u2019s compliance. Our analytics team delivered a self-service BI tool that enabled \u201corder data\u201d visualization and empowered staff at each hospital to find, investigate, and correct processes that were impacting compliance and safety at their locations. We integrated a complex data set into Microsoft SQL Server; designed and developed interactive, user-friendly visual dashboards using Tableau software; and emphasized user adoption through site-by-site, hands-on educational workshops. The tool was rolled out to eight of Advocate\u2019s hospitals. The Tableau solution gave Advocate\u2019s Clinical Informaticists the ability to interact with their data as never before. Many expressed that this view was a real eye-opener, arming them with the insights they needed to actually make a measurable difference to CPOE compliance. They can now look at data at a high level; identify potential problem areas; and isolate the root cause of issues. Delivering insights through Tableau data visualization empowered the hospital staff with easy access to pared-down information, enabling decision makers to make the necessary process and policy changes to ultimately improve patient care."

        "content": "According to Tom Dewar, Head of Information at St. George\u2019s Healthcare NHS Trust in London, Tableau is helping the hospital convert information into insight and improve patient outcomes. \u201cTableau cements anecdotally-held truths and busts myths,\u201d he says. Immensely popular across the hospital\u2014based on its ease of use and ability to instantly answer questions\u2014the Tableau visual analytics solution is helping St. George\u2019s to deliver outstanding patient care and meet the challenges of cost reduction, resource allocation, and compliance regulations. With more than 6,000 staff caring for patients around the clock, St. George\u2019s Healthcare NHS Trust is the largest healthcare provider in southwest London. Data from the hospital\u2019s electronic health records and other applications creates an unprecedented opportunity for the Trust to accelerate decision making, optimize clinical outcomes, and improve operational performance. However, reliance on manual reporting systems\u2014such as spreadsheets, slide decks, and pivot tables\u2014made preparing reports time-consuming. Information was often out of date\u2014up to three months old\u2014by the time it reached the clinical directors and other decision makers. A lack of reporting consistency between departments also prevented teams being compared against one another. Tom Dewar, Head of Information at St. George\u2019s Healthcare NHS Trust, experienced the problem first-hand. \u201cWe were gluing together siloed information with our bare hands,\u201d he says. \u201cWe compile scorecards on issues such as number of patients in Accident and Emergency, waiting times, and patient readmissions. So much time was spent gathering the data, it was often too old to be acted upon. We needed to be more proactive.\u201d Dewar and his team quickly shrank a shortlist of potential analytics solutions, which included Tableau, QlikTech\u2019s QlikView, SAP Business Objects, and Microsoft, down to two possible suitors: Tableau and QlikView. \u201cTableau edged QlikView on almost every score,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ease of use, total cost of ownership, and top right position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant all favored Tableau.\u201d Owing to the insatiable demand among users for the best-in-class platform for visual analytics, an initial deployment of Tableau Desktop licenses quickly blossomed into almost 100 Tableau Server users. \u201cTableau Professional Services did a great job in helping us with the planning and installation. Their knowledge, experience and commitment\u2014coupled with the general ease of use of Tableau\u2014meant we were live in days,\u201d says Dewar. What difference is Tableau making? For the first time, St. George\u2019s has accurate, near real-time insight into acute hospital services, plus a wide variety of specialist hospital-based and community services. For example, the quarterly scorecard-based reporting has moved to an almost continuous process, with key clinical divisions like Medicine, Surgery, and Women & Children now having information on their services never more than one day old. \u201cBy capturing rich, timely insight into the hospital\u2019s current behaviour, the team is able to advance care coordination, improve care quality and increase healthcare efficiency,\u201d says Dewar. Dewar cites an example of this in action. \u201cOur chief executive was recently talking to hospital commissioners about the pressure of coping with increased volumes of patients during the winter months. Using Tableau, it took me just 30 minutes to create a visual interpretation of why we are so busy. This included an \u2018Arrivals\u2019 dashboard displaying patient arrival metrics by date, by specialty and other criteria. When he asked what was behind the demand, it took me only five minutes more to create a visual showing stroke activity to be one of the primary causes,\" says Dewar. \"Being able to quickly uncover important patterns and trends like these are essential to data-driven decision making. In the past, I would have struggled to get an answer back the same day,\u201d he says. The aim is to eventually move towards self-service analytics for key areas of the hospital, with Dewar\u2019s team concentrating on in-depth analytical work and statistical analysis. \u201cTableau is so easy to use, we want consultants, divisional heads, managers, and other staff to answer questions themselves like, \u2018how many heart patients did we see last year?\u2019, or \u2018how many patents are delivered to Accident and Emergency by ambulance, versus walk-in cases?\u2019 By answering questions like these more quickly, St. George\u2019s will be able to increase patient flow, improve outcomes, and ensure every touch-point with the patient and their family is executed flawlessly. \u201cEveryone who sees Tableau instantly falls in love with it,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt allows them to gain insight into their business like they\u2019ve never had before. Our over-riding aim is to deliver outstanding patient care against a backdrop of unrelenting pressure to reduce costs, maximize resource allocation, and meet compliance considerations. Tableau will take St. George\u2019s a long way towards achieving those goals.\u201d"

And in order to use that data, Copa Airlines turned to Tableau. In this video, four Copa Airlines employees talk about how they are gaining more insight from their data\u2014and having more fun in the process\u2014with Tableau. Video in Spanish Tableau: What was your first impression of Tableau? Ingrid Gudi\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez, Application, Integration and Information Services Director: Wow! The first time we saw Tableau, I could not believe it. The ease, the speed with which it presented the information. Tableau: What would you say is the benefit of Tableau?\nRoberto Del Rio Ayala, Wholesalers Coordinator: I think that now with Tableau you no longer worry about how to use the information but rather how to analyze it, how to think about it, how to take more advantage. It's marvelous, for example, to see how each of our customers behaves. Everything is there, a few clicks. We knew we had a lot of customers\u2014or we knew it, but we did not know how each one of them was. Now with Tableau it's very visual to see them, to know how they behave, what their characteristics are. That helps us a lot to make better decisions, to be more assertive. Tableau: Is Tableau changing things in your daily job?\nRoberto: Yes, definitely. Once you have access to the information so easily and quickly, you become much more creative\u2014you want to manipulate the information, you want to retrieve more data. Well, Tableau provides you with all the tools to develop creativity and to display it in different ways and understand it much better. Jarrett Vaucher, Senior Planning Analyst: The first day I used Tableau it was great. Because that changes my day-to-day life. When I used Tableau for the first time, like \"Wow! I have to learn and take advantage of this tool because it's going to change for me, for the company, for the industry.\" Before, I was managing several files and in these files there was a great amount of data that I could not produce and see that it was there. But with Tableau, with a few clicks, I was able to see this data that I did not know existed. So this brings a lot of value, day to day. Olga Guizado, Senior Analyst: Tableau is dynamic, interactive, and a lot of fun. Because it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s not the old way\u2014it makes meetings fun and exciting. Tableau: Are you looking at large quantities of data?\nIngrid: We're in the airline business so that information varies a lot, and there is a lot of it. Millions and millions of passengers, with millions of transactions, and with Tableau they are easily managed. Tableau: Can you describe the data sources you use in Tableau?\nIngrid: Initially, we are connecting with the data warehouse\u2014it's InterData. That data warehouse has 18 or 20 sources of information. But the passing users are connecting it to the People soft structure, to flat files, they connect sources that are not necessarily connected to the data warehouse. They are the ones that invent and do a million things, more than we do. Tableau: Are you able to get more done now that you have Tableau?\nIngrid: I could not believe the graphics, the speed, the clarity and how quickly so many things could be built.\nJarrett: I can put all my data in on Excel file.\nAdd that file directly and work in three, four seconds on Tableau. And then seconds later I have a graph, a bar chart, whatever I want\u2014and quickly! Before it would take me three days to update a dashboard. And right now I can do everything in three hours. Roberto: Before using Tableau there were reports that would take a week, hours to do. Now, in the matter of just preparing the dashboard and in minutes you end up with the information. Tableau: Are you using Tableau across the company?\nIngrid: We're using Tableau in a good part of the company. Almost all of it: human resources, finance, planning, income, everything related to operational analysis. It started in small areas and later is started growing, growing, growing until it's almost viral. Everyone wanted it. Tableau: Fantastic! Any thoughts about what it would be like if you didn\u2019t have Tableau?\nOlga: If they would tell me tomorrow that I couldn't use Tableau any more, the truth is I would look for a new job. I would fight to the death! (laughs) Jarrett: If Tableau were withdrawn right now, everyone would cry."

What departments use Tableau?\nSid: We have Insights groups that use it for analytics and reporting dashboarding. Advertising teams using it for optimization. Development teams using it for testing, software development processes. We have a lot of our development teams using it, and we just have such a huge opportunity to take advantage of all of the data that we're generating from our business that Tableau Desktop has enabled us to leverage that data and then the servers (are) allowing us to put it in the hands of end users. I'm a product manager working with development teams. So now we use it for sort of rapid prototyping. We have a lot of our data science organization uses it to represent the results of the models and statistical analysis that they're generating; they're able to use it as a communication tool back to the business for some of that pretty advanced stuff. So (there are) lots of different use cases throughout all kinds of different teams. It's really the fact that anybody can use it to make their internal teams' businesses more efficient and effective that is really powerful for us. Tableau: What data sources are you using with Tableau?\nSid: So we have about 15 terabytes of data. We recently installed a new scalable data warehouse and so it's growing 3X to 5X a year. We're connecting to a Greenplum Data Warehouse. We have some systems that use Microsoft SQL Server. So it's a variety of systems, lots of Excel files, SAAS, but primarily Greenplum as an enterprise data warehouse. Tableau: How are you benefiting from Cobalt\u2019s adoption of Tableau?\nSid: Tableau has enabled me to move beyond just monkeying around with data, raw data, and getting that data in the hands of the person who is asking the questions. And that frees up my time to then focus and think at a higher level about where opportunities are and be a little bit more creative with the opportunity that we have."

We have a sales force of about two, three hundred people. It's fairly lean; each salesperson has a pretty big territory to manage, between 150 to 200 individual agency accounts. We have about 50,000 or so of local, independent insurance agents scattered around the country. What I do in my group is give the sales team information that's easy to use, easy to understand and really actionable. So we give them information all the way from high-level territory management numbers and job objectives, how they're performing month-over-month in order to meet their goals for the year. And we also let them take that information and drill down all the way down to individual agency performance so that they can start making connections with the information, seeing how individual agencies, seeing how their performance rolls up to their job objectives. They can understand who they need to see, when they need to go to them, what do they need to talk about in order to move those numbers that they see kind of on the front page\u2014that's their bread and butter. Tableau: What has the reaction been?\nRohan: The reps get together once or twice in a year just in their own region. And the idea with these meetings is that they get an update on what the business is doing and what we're doing for them. Every time I get to go there and roll out a new set of features the \u2018aha moments\u2019 that happen\u2014my favorite was when people literally got out of their seats to come closer just to get a better look at the screen, because they were like, \"Wait, it can do what? How easy was that? Wait a minute, can you show me that click again because it took you one click and it takes me 20 minutes to build a report.\" Tableau: What is the benefit of using Tableau with this data that you\u2019re sharing with your sales team?\nRohan: They're \u2018people\u2019 people, you know, they're not \u2018data\u2019 people. And when you give them something that strips away all of the stuff that you've traditionally associated with looking at data and you turn it into information, that's when it's really helpful. You're showing people a better way and you're showing them that it doesn't have to be antiquated\u2014you don't have to go through a bunch of different reports and make those connections yourselves, because those are not the skills we're hiring you for. You're a sales rep. We want you to be able to sell. And everything else should be invisible in the background. Tableau: What does giving the sales team that insight doing? What is the benefit?\nRohan: When you give a sales rep the power of all of that data analytics and that data story they can just take it to the agency's office and answer questions right there on the fly. It's such a powerful message. They have the information that they know the agency needs, they have the information to help them grow their business, and they have the information to help them really partner with the agency as opposed to just selling them stuff. Tableau: How has it benefited you to be able to provide that kind of information? Rohan: What Tableau gives me is the ability to really create something that's game-changing. It has changed the culture of how data is used at Progressive within the sales force, and it changes the way our salespeople think of us as data people, numbers people. All of a sudden, you know, it's user-friendly and it's approachable and it's helpful as opposed to being something that is, you know, a black box that they know nothing about. It's a great feeling."

In this video, Bill Engel, Chairman of Consumer Orbit discusses how his company uses Alteryx and Tableau to turn big data into valuable knowledge. Tableau: What sort of questions do you help your customers answer?\nBill Engel, Chairman: A CMO will pick up the phone and call our people and say, \"Such and such is happening in this particular store, I need to know what's happening. We're able to focus in on that store using Tableau and generate a custom report for the CMO. This is the wave of the future: Instantaneous information on who the customer is, linked to what they're buying. Tableau: What is the biggest challenge you run into?\nBill: The biggest challenge is the amount of data that we handle. We carry 120 million households with all of the consumer data around those households. Where they shop, what they buy, the products they prefer, the brands they prefer. We also get data from our clients, transactions-based data, what's happening at the cash register, what their customers are doing, and a number of other data sources as well. Tableau: That is a great deal of data. How do you manage data of that size?\nBill: We integrate all these databases into one large database using our data partner, Alteryx. We use Alteryx to make sense of massive amounts of data. We use Tableau to present that so that a CMO or somebody at an ad agency who is looking at the same definition of that customer can say, \"Okay, I see what the CMO's problem is and here's how we're going to solve it with media. We're going to buy these four television programs that are listed here on the Tableau Server because, you know, we have information about what TV programs these people are watching.\" So it's become an incredible tool. It's revolutionizing the way things are being done. Tableau: You\u2019ve been in the market research business for more than 40 years. Can you describe what\u2019s different today? Bill: Today's CMO doesn't have six months to wait to make a decision. So the transactions-based data from his cash register that comes from the data that they collect through supply chain can be incredibly valuable to his decision-making process. What has happened today is that we have so many possible data sources for decision-makers, they're all using their own definitions of the customer. So what CMOs have asked us to do is take all of this data, bring it together so we can create a single definition of the customer, and that what gets run through Tableau. And what Tableau does, with its different sets of data visualizations, is it gives that ability to us to take data, distill it to its essence to one word, and the CMO can look at that and say, \"Okay, I got it.\""

We're sort of like data geeks\u2014folks that have data in our DNA. Tableau: You\u2019re our kind of people! What made you decide to partner with us at Tableau?\nAlex: We brought in Tableau a while back because we created really amazing data solutions\u2014technically, it is great. But the managing directors can't see it. And so we realized there was this gap about actually having individuals consume the technology, consume the knowledge\u2014versus having it well-architected. So the key benefit we saw right away is that for the first time, this -- this insight to become instantaneous and acknowledged versus, \"See, if you click 20 different times, you finally get to this spreadsheet\u2014which you had your assistant put together.\" So it is this insight that Tableau brings to (the) financial industry, to pharmaceutical, to media, right, to entertainment. Where people for the first time go, \"Ah, that's my business, that's my data.\" Before that, we couldn't get to that right? We always had it buried under a pile of rubble. USEReady focuses on data insight for the financial, healthcare, and media & entertainment industries Tableau: How has partnering with Tableau impacted your business?\nAlex: It's interesting how Tableau has changed things because when we used to start conversations around data. It was a question and it was a conversation around technology. Tableau came into the picture and technology disappeared. It became about\u2014\u201cWhat are the rules in our business? What's the governance in our business? What are the decisions we need to make today?\u201d So the conversation changed from \u201cWhat are the requirements?\u201d\u2014which was kind of an artificial conversation\u2014to a real conversation about our business, our customers, our culture. And that's the conversation most decision makers want. Tableau: That\u2019s great to hear! That sounds like it would be a more satisfying and effective conversation on your end, too.\nAlex: We have the old-fashioned mindset that when people come to you, they really are looking to solve a problem. So it isn't about selling, it isn't about demoing, it's about taking data issues and making them disappear, right? We love getting those folks to be able to go, \"Is that our business? Wow, we haven't seen that before.\" So what do we do and why do people love to do business with us? Because we take that piece and we make it user-ready, hence the name of the company."

In this video, Rik Tamm-Daniels, Vice President of Technology for Attivio, discusses how Attivio pairs with Tableau to help customers see and understand unstructured valuable data that used to be considered \u201cimpossible.\u201d Tableau: Can you explain the value in helping businesses analyze their unstructured data?\nRik Tamm-Daniels, Vice President of Technology: Business users, I think, for a long time have known that sources like email and documents do contain relevant information about the business \u2026 but the technology hasn't allowed them to look at it. And they've even kind of stopped asking for it because the technology was too limiting. Unstructured social data combines with structured data to deliver valuable insight Now with the big data movement and big content, we've been able to bring that information in a very rapid way to those end users and really start delivering on those business cases and driving that forward. Tableau: What would you say is the value of using Tableau with Attivio?\nRik: Understanding the nature of data is really important\u2014and applying the right technology to cost-effectively and efficiently get the insight that's relevant to the business out of it. And that's exactly what we do with Tableau. When we go into a customer or a prospect and we look at their data, it's not \u2018Here's your data, we can slice and dice it this way.\u2019 It's \u2018What is the business story we can tell here?\u2019 Tableau: How do customers react when you show them the business story? Rik: They see directly how they're going to benefit from bringing this information together and visualizing it. How it's going to show them the outliers. How it's going to show them the trends and allow them to\u2014because they have the full context of unstructured and structured together\u2014to actually not only see the outlier, see the trends, but drill into them to understand the why, the how and the what. The nature of our system, the way we can bring data together, and using Tableau as a front-end, you can have very agile BI implementations that augment what people are doing with their data warehouses. So you deliver the data faster to the end users as they're exploring, as they're discovering, as part of an overall analytic practice. They're able to gain competitive advantage by leveraging data, leveraging information in ways that their competitors out in the field are not. It's really about not even just a gradual evolution but a whole sea change in how they look at data, how they visualize it and how they drive business value from it. Tableau is fantastic as a partner\u2014as a key element for our customers. It sounds a little cheesy, but the satisfaction of creating a dashboard that opens someone's eyes\u2014it's a thing of beauty."

Tableau: How would you describe the culture at Seagate?\nGina: Innovation is definitely on our mind. All the time.\nGanesh: We see the differences that are happening in the marketplace, we see the change. Tableau: Your company is about inventing the future in many ways. Tell me about that.\nGina: Right now, we talk in terms of terabytes, and in the not so distant future we're going to be shipping zettabytes of storage. The need for storage is only increasing, it's increasing exponentially.\nJohn: Seagate's culture of innovation is all around bringing inventions that have never existed before. Tableau: Can you tell me how you use data to answer your questions at Seagate.\nGanesh: People are very passionate here. There is no problem that's too small to fix, and there is no problem where everyone's not going to collaborate.\nGina: We have information from our sales group, from our finance group, and from operations\u2026\nMike Mixon, BI Program Manager: There's revenue data, there's market share data, there's sales and marketing data.\nJohn: Moving to Tableau really allowed the business to take over the creation, the generation of those types of analytics, which made a huge difference. Tableau: How so?\nGanesh: Because everybody is looking at the same data in the same way, and they can always drill down and see what they want to look at, decision-making happens much faster\nMike: They can immediately see what's going on and move on to the next question, the next meeting, the next whatever. Tableau: What benefit does that offer?\nMike: Now, \"what-ifs\" are cheap. It's empowering in the sense that they can ask questions of the data and get answers without having to go to someone else.\nGina: You\u2019re having a conversation about the data. You're not held back by limitations that would prevent you from really getting to know your data. Tableau: Would you say that your professional life is improved now that you use Tableau?\nGanesh: For me, data is no longer just a bunch of rows and columns. It's actually something more meaningful. It's actually a story that I can tell someone else. John: Personally, Tableau has impacted my ability to make more rapid business decisions.\nGina: Tableau has fundamentally changed the way I think about data. I am super impatient now. I think all questions should be answered quickly. Tableau: What do you think is the next step?\nGina: We\u2019re never satisfied with the status quo. We\u2019re always looking for a way to innovate, a way to push the envelope.\nJohn: Not only are we working on just the technology, but (also) innovation in supply chain, innovation in demand and supply planning processes, innovation in business processes, we\u2019re really trying to make the most efficient business that we can."

        "company": "Rosetta Stone",
        "content": "Rosetta Stone provides cutting-edge interactive technology that is changing the way the world learns. It\u2019s collecting data at a rate of hundreds of millions of transactions each day. The company deployed Tableau\u2014with help from InterWorks\u2014to address its two-week queue of large data and ad-hoc analytics requests. Today, those requests are turned around in just a day. It\u2019s also expanding its user base, with about 70% of the financial team using Tableau along with customer outreach operations and other departments throughout the organization. Tableau: Can you tell us a little bit about what Rosetta Stone wanted to do with its data? Joseph Bertram, Senior Business Intelligence Architect: We're trying to reinvent ourselves. Rosetta Stone\u2014at the corporate level\u2014is very data-driven. We're really trying to be much more of an online presence and app presence. We want to do it as intelligently as we possibly can, and that's where all the data comes in handy. From the lowest-level analyst to the highest-level executives, we're trying to make all of our decisions from good data and good analytics. Tableau: How many people are looking at data visualizations published to your Tableau Server? Joseph: We have close to 400 Tableau Server users who are consumers\u2014they're not report developers, but they are data consumers. They will come and use the pre-prepared workbooks that we've done with InterWorks to kind of get them part of the way. And we're actually getting some of them who are kind of \u2018power users\u2019 where they'll take an existing workbook and they'll edit it on the Web browser. They'll slice it and dice it a little bit differently and pivot it a little bit differently to create their own visualizations. Tableau: You mentioned InterWorks, one of our partners. What was the benefit of bringing them in to deliver training? Joseph: At Rosetta Stone, we're all about teaching our customers how to speak a new language, but InterWorks really helped us learn how to speak our own data to each other and to analyze it and dig into it and understand it and use it to make our actionable business decisions. Tableau: That\u2019s fantastic! Can you give me a specific example of a way that InterWorks helped you? Joseph: The partnership with InterWorks saved us a lot of headaches. You can pick up Tableau, you can do some easy things, and it's great. But then some of the advanced things that you want to do\u2014you want to put on some error bars onto your graph, or you want to make it change a color at a certain threshold\u2014it needs a little bit of finesse. Having InterWorks there was amazing because they helped us get off on the right foot right off the bat. We followed best practices from the very first day, and it helped us not waste development time and (for example) have to throw away work because it wasn't quite best practices and we had to redo it later on. Tableau: What kind of data are you looking at in Tableau? Anything that stands out in your mind? Joseph: We're really getting great results out of our Salesforce data. With Tableau, we're able to hook up directly to Salesforce data and see our opportunities and manage forecasting. But we're also able to do some really cool analyses that they just weren't able to do in Excel in the past. And that's where I'm seeing 'ah-hah' moments where they say, 'Oh, my God, I've never seen our Salesforce data in this perspective before!\u2019\u201d Tableau: Wow. Are you doing other things with your Salesforce data? Joseph: Salesforce is our lead and opportunity management tool. But it's not our financial system of record. Wiith Tableau, we're able to blend that data on the fly with our system of record for financial data and see some bigger trends and better funnels of opportunity to close (deals) for our institutional team. Tableau: What else are you doing with your data these days? Joseph: We're trying to really get more and more in contact with our customers and really increase their satisfaction. Some of our customer outreach operations, they're doing custom analysis to do different trends over who's enjoying it, are they having different usage patterns? Can we do things to help these people and get more of our customer base to enjoy our product? So it's coming a bit more away from business intelligence and more into operational intelligence and helping people in a real-time situation. With Tableau, they can get a much more holistic view of all of their data and get a better understanding. Our biggest consumers are our financial team. They constantly are doing different pricing models. They're doing different analysis on whether certain marketing campaigns work, should we repeat it? What markets are doing well? So they're our biggest and by far the best. They check a lot of our sales data and do a lot of different year-over-year analysis depending even on our direct-to-consumer vertical. They will even go daily, year-over-year, day-to-day kind of analysis to see \u2018Is Mother\u2019s Day doing as well this year as it did last year? Is Black Friday doing well or is cyber Monday doing well?\u2019 Tableau: What was your business intelligence process like before Tableau? Joseph: I saw so many people in our company that looked at business intelligence as really just data dumps\u2014and then they would try to intuit a solution out of a massive, million-record data file with 150 columns. And they would try to dig for a week on end to try to make up a business decision. Versus what I see Tableau is you have a business question and you can just dive in and find an answer. Tableau: That\u2019s great to hear! How has using Tableau helped you, personally? Joseph: We have a very small team for such a large company. We can't possibly keep up with the demand for data So the more that we can get people self-reliant, the happier we will be. I would imagine without Tableau, I would probably have a pretty huge backlog of work to catch up on!"

        "content": "Kilwins\u2019 handmade chocolates, fudge, and ice cream have been delighting customers since 1947. Today, more than 90 franchisee-owned stores in 19 states bear the Kilwins name. Kilwins wanted to use its sales data more effectively, but gathering and analyzing the point of sales (POS) data was far too time-consuming. Today with Tableau, Kilwins is able to easily use its data to guide promotional efforts and to inform franchise owners\u2019 purchasing choices. \u201cFranchising is interesting and a lot of fun. You get to know the owners pretty well,\u201d explains Jeff Hall, Director of Marketing, Commerce, and IT for Kilwins. \u201cI came out of corporate America, and that\u2019s a very different environment\u2014you direct people what to do and they go do it. Here, it's a little different. You have to earn the franchise owners\u2019 trust and confidence.\u201d As part of that trust-building effort, Hall would share data about company-wide sales at bi-annual regional meetings. Unfortunately, gathering these sales metrics was extremely time-consuming. The data is stored in the company\u2019s point of sale (POS) system. When Hall would try to run a report for 57 stores\u2014the number of stores currently transitioned onto the POS system\u2014the report writer would crash. \u201cWe have more than 750 manufactured products and in the stores there are more than 1,800 recipes that they can make,\u201d Hall points out. Each product and recipe has a different item number within the POS system. \u201cYou can imagine what a nightmare it was to copy and paste all of that information for 57 stores,\u201d he says. \u201cYou'd have to run individual store reports, copy and paste that reporting into Excel, and then put all the stores together,\u201d says Hall. \u201cIt would take weeks to pull the data together for these regional meetings.\u201d Hall had the same issue when trying to gather data for the company\u2019s annual planning session. Hall also worried that such a manual process was ripe for manual error. \u201cI would have to run by store all of a certain product type\u2014Truffles or Tuttles, which are one of our signature items with pecans or cashews covered in caramel and then enrobed in chocolate,\u201d he says. \u201cI'd be cutting and pasting by three or four lines at a time. It was tedious. I had to check my work two or three times.\u201d Hall would go through this intensive data-gathering effort only a few times per year. For example, Hall points out that while he technically could have gathered the data to manage a promotion as it was ongoing, the amount of time required to do so made the idea unreasonable. Even the process of choosing products to promote was a left to instinct and experience. In early 2013, Kilwins\u2019 CFO suggested that Hall look at Tableau Software. Hall downloaded a trial in July and quickly realized that he could remove a significant amount of manual data wrangling with Tableau. Kilwins purchased a license for Tableau Desktop and as well as a Tableau Consulting engagement. \u201cBy the time September came around\u2014and with the help of Janet, my Tableau Consultant\u2014I had a standard workbook created. I could put together a good feel of where our sales were coming from by product category, right down to the item level,\u201d says Hall. Since then, Hall has created several other workbooks to answer other questions. He can update his data by simply running a new data extract; the entire refresh takes approximately 45 minutes. Hall notes that he can work on other priorities while the extract runs. Today, Kilwins is able to plan its promotions using data, rather than instinct. \u201cNow we have the talent onboard to help us visualize what our ideas are and because we've got a lot more access to the data quickly, we know how to build out the promotion,\u201d says Hall. \u201cThe stores are a lot more colorful now.\u201d For example, during a recent promotional planning meeting, Hall needed to identify the top-selling items within the Tuttle line. He estimates that finding the answer in Tableau took two minutes. \u201cNow we know what collateral to build for the stores. Before it would have taken up to eight hours to do that, and now it's literally minutes, if not seconds. It\u2019s really simple,\u201d he says. Executives also have much better insight into ongoing performance with on-the-fly insight into current sales data through Tableau. \u201cEvery two weeks we have a standing meeting that is based on seasonal promotions, I'll be in the meeting and somebody will ask a question\u2014like how many nutcrackers have we sold\u2014and I'll just pull up the data for how that product did,\u201d says Hall. \u201cNow we can really manage the promotions because I've got the data to make decisions based on the actual sales. In the past, it was so hard to get the data that you just couldn't take the time to do it. So we were very picky and choosy about what data we asked for.\u201d Hall also says that he is able to share sales performance more easily with franchise owners now. \"I can very easily go back year over year to look at a promotional period. I can show accurate sales data for what was in that promotion,\u201d says Hall. \u201cI can pull it together much more quickly\u2014and make the data specific to the actual promotion\u2014 much more easily.\u201d \u201cThose store owners that didn't participate in the promotion, they see the results. And they're saying, \u2018Oh, I'm getting a sales lift by adding savory truffles? Okay, I'll buy them next time.\u2019 It's helping us.\u201d Hall says that he is seeing more franchise owners participating in the promotions as a result. \u201cWhat we're seeing is that they're starting to really engage in the promotional products because they know it works.\u201d \u201cWe are able to find not so much what is successful\u2014 because that jumps right out at you\u2014but it helps us figure out what's not successful,\u201d Hall says. For example, he recalls a specific molded chocolate in the Nutcracker Christmas promotion\u2014Clara the ballerina figurine. \u201cI ran the report and boom, we could see right away that the sales just weren't where they should have been compared to the nutcrackers and the Santa figures.\u201d In previous years, this data was very difficult to determine. \u201cThis time we found it quickly.\u201d In fact, Hall says, \u201cit was hugely advantageous\u201d to have Tableau available during this year\u2019s planning session preparation. \u201cDon, the owner, had given me three pages worth of stuff that he needed,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThings like, \u2018Figure out what percent Chocolates is of overall sales, but now break it down by item group within the Chocolate category.\u2019 And in the past I would know, \u2018Oh, this is going to take forever to find out.\u201d This time, with Tableau, Hall was able to gather the data and complete the analysis in a matter of hours\u2014which included initial workbook set up\u2014 rather than weeks that it took previously. \u201cOnce you have the workbooks set up, running the queries is easy now. It just takes seconds. The time effort now is just so condensed, it's fantastic. And you know the data is real, it\u2019s right, it\u2019s accurate.\u201d Hall also says that using Tableau has led to other planning session benefits. \u201cIt was helpful when we were actually in the meeting. If we had specific questions, I could drill down into data by store or by product category or product type\u2014whatever we needed,\u201d says Hall. \u201cWe accomplished a lot more\u2014and more quickly than we would have previously. We were able to focus on other things than worrying about the data.\u201d Perhaps the greatest benefit of choosing Tableau is the time it offers Hall to focus on more strategic efforts. \u201cI really have three jobs. I have IT, I have Marketing, and I have Business Development. So the time I get back allows me to focus on those other things,\u201d he says."

        "content": "Tableau: One Kings Lane is a fast-rising star in a very challenging industry. How is data insight contributing to your success?\nGeraldine Niemczyk, Manager, Planning and Business Analytics: In order to do retail well, there is a lot of complexity in it. Jeff Ferris, Data Product Manager: We're working with huge amounts of data, where we can start to tease out customer trends, figure out customer clustering. Geraldine: And there are a lot of metrics that go into that: How are you performing? How are you delivering the experience to customers? Tableau: How would you describe One Kings Lane?\nJeff: The mission at One Kings Lane is to disrupt the home d\u00e9cor industry. Geraldine: We are changing the way people do home d\u00e9cor. Jeff: We have a very dynamic business that can change day-to-day drastically because we're constantly launching new product. Tableau: What do you think sets your company apart?\nRich Hicks, Data Analytics Engineer: People here are very good at what they do. They're amazingly good at what they do. Geraldine: The aesthetics and how we present the product to the customer is off the charts. I've never seen anything like that. Technology has enabled us to become what we stand for as a company, and it has also enabled us to grow so fast. Tableau: How does data play into that?\nRich: There's this exponential growth of data in the company that's being used on a daily basis by merchandisers, by marketers, by executive staff. So it's pretty core. Jeff: The engineering team is solving a diverse set of problems. Data is very important to One Kings Lane, and has been since the inception of the company. When you're talking about running as many products as we do, you can't avoid using data. There just isn't enough time in the day for people to manually figure out what is working and what isn't. Tableau: What sort of benefits have you seen from choosing Tableau to understand your data?\nJeff: The time saving we\u2019ve achieved using Tableau is incredible. Rich: Basically anyone in the company can log into Tableau Server and find data. Geraldine: It can save hours in a week, in some cases hours a day. Rich: The merchandisers who curate the sales events on our site, they save days\u2019 worth of time. And it actually sparks a little bit of competition for the guys that are sitting (behind me) answering the calls. Tableau: How does it benefit One Kings Lane to put that sort of information into the hands of colleagues who might not traditionally be considered \u201cdata people\u201d?\nGeraldine: I think one of the great features about Tableau is the ability to enable other business users that may not be that savvy or experienced with data to actually look at their own data and make decisions from it. People can look at the same thing that I'm looking at, and can also be self-sufficient and look at other things that may be I would not have been able to spot. Jeff: One Kings Lane is a very visual audience. You've got people that are very aesthetically minded. And if you can't present data in a way that is visually appealing and understandable, it's not going to work. My favorite way to use Tableau is to sit down with someone that has some questions about the business, and actually start explaining things in real time. I think that's where Tableau shines. I haven't worked with another tool that can keep up with the speed of thought essentially. You can ask a question and then you can start to tease out the answer to that question in front of them visually. Tableau: What would you say to someone considering Tableau?\nGeraldine: It increases our sales, it decreases our costs, there\u2019s a direct impact. It just gets you insight faster. Of all the goals that you might have in your position, you can just accomplish them faster and better (with Tableau). I think it has a huge, positive, rippling effect across the org."

        "content": "Pete Misner is a principal in the Northshore School district in Bothell, Washington. He is also a passionate believer in using data to improve educational outcomes. In addition to his \u201cday job\u201d as an elementary school principal, he teaches aspiring principals how to use data to improve decision-making at the University of Washington. Misner\u2019s elementary school has enrolled nearly 800 students; all of these children are regularly assessed through both standardized tests such as Washington State\u2019s Measurement of Student Progress (MSP) and classroom based reading assessments, including the Fountas and Pinnell Independent Reading Record assessment (F&P IRR.) \u201cOur primary data focus is on reading,\u201d says Misner. His school conducts reading assessments throughout the school year. \u201cOne of our district performance measures is ensuring that all kids meet standard in reading by the end of third grade.\u201d WA State assessment data viz by Pete Misner. Click to drill down or filter the data in Tableau Public. This deadline is not arbitrary, Misner notes. \u201cThere is plenty of research that says if students are reading at grade level by the end of third grade, then great things happen. And if they aren't\u2014then it becomes very difficult for those students to catch up with their peers.\u201d \u201cWe don't have resources to waste and we don\u2019t have time to waste,\u201d Misner says. \u201cEverything is to help kids get to standard or above.\u201d But with so many students in his school, it was difficult and time-consuming to understand each individual\u2019s needs and strengths. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have that individual student data view, then there's this phrase that I like, called \u2018spray and pray.\u2019 You spray the resources across the school or classroom and you pray that it sticks where it needs to,\u201d Misner says. The most common resource Misner\u2019s school receives from the state is funding for additional instructor time for struggling readers. In order to optimize this instructional resource\u2014and others\u2014it was important to cluster students with similar needs strategically. This required a clear understanding of the exact needs and skills of every student across the school. More importantly, it was critical that all teachers had this information to inform their collaborative decision-making as they prepared for the next school year. In addition, Misner wanted to be able to review the results from interventions, to expand particularly effective approaches while eliminating those that offered less impact. \u201cI've been into data for quite some time even as a teacher,\u201d says Misner. \u201cThroughout my whole career, I\u2019ve been really passionate about using data to inform instruction. But I\u2019ve been frustrated along the way\u2014like everybody is\u2014with the massive amounts of data that we have to digest and how long it could take.\u201d He notes that it can take months to go from a data overview, such as looking at school-level data and identifying a priority question. Once a question is determined, the principal typically sends it to a data team for analysis and visualization. Once the principal finally has the results in-hand, it\u2019s time to schedule staff meetings to present the findings. \u201cThen you're finally moving towards making steps about student learning problems,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes months and months and months.\u201d He had been using Excel to do his own grassroots data analysis when he saw a TED talk that changed everything. \u201cI saw Gapminder\u2014the Hans Rosling TED talk\u2014and that just blew my mind,\u201d he says. Misner was determined to find a data visualization tool to help him with his analysis. \u201cThen I saw a crime statistics dashboard on the Seattle Times website, and I immediately knew I wanted to learn more about Tableau,\u201d he says. \u201cI instantly saw the value in that for districts, schools, classes, subgroups, teachers, so forth.\u201d Misner downloaded the free, two-week trial of Tableau and experimented with his data. He then purchased a personal license for Tableau Desktop and was able to use an advanced training stipend from his school district to enroll in Tableau training sessions to learn best practices for developing visualizations. Today, Misner typically looks at two primary data sources: MSP data downloaded from the state website and F&P reading assessment data stored in Excel. He has built several different views, including an MSP visualization that includes data from the last five years of testing across the state, which he has shared with education colleagues. They can view and interact with the visualizations by downloading the free Tableau Reader. Misner is also introducing Tableau into the program that he is teaching at the UW, and the response has been positive. But Misner is most pleased with how he has been able to inspire more data-driven decisions at his elementary school with help from Tableau. \u201cWe are tracking individual progress and interventions, identifying if we need more interventions,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing able to click on the visualization and get down to that individual kid level so quickly \u2014that's what's exciting. That's helpful.\u201d \u201cIt's truly about that insightful moment where an educator knows just a little bit more than they did before and is able to act more efficiently and wisely,\u201d says Misner. Misner has seen improvements in several areas since implementing Tableau:"

        "company": "Princeton University",
        "content": "One of the oldest and most respected universities in the United States, Princeton University boasts a generous financial aid program. The Office of Development plays a significant part in that effort, initiating and nurturing donor relationships. Its work also supports other crucial aspects of Princeton\u2019s mission. \u201cWe raise money for scholarships, for fellowships and for professorships,\u201d says Heather Campbell, Associate Director, Development Research Analytics, Princeton University. \u201cOur capital projects and important annual unrestricted funding comes from the support of our alumni, family and friends, organizations and foundations.\u201d While the Office of Development maintained in-depth transactional giving data and relationship management data, staffers often had to dig through several different reports to answer questions\u2014a time-consuming, manual effort with potential for mistakes. \u201cThey were downloading five different reports and then putting them into Excel and merging them together, manipulating them a bunch of different ways to get the information,\u201d explains Campbell. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely going to be human error whenever you start doing a lot of data manipulation in Excel.\u201d Viewing data in Excel also made it difficult to notice results that didn't quite make sense\u2014data entry errors or outliers that could indicate significant risks or opportunities. The volume of work posed another, more subtle issue for staffers. \u201cIt can be easy to get into a mindset where you\u2019re simply checking off finding different data elements, rather than trying to understand the overall business question,\u201d says Campbell. Members of the major gifts team each manage a pool of approximately 200 prospects\u2014far too many people to rely on memory to manage contacts. With no dedicated tools to visualize overall engagement, the office has relied on large list reports and manual review of individual records to make sure prospect and donor relationships were adequately tended. The research analytics team was responsible for reporting high-level campaign metrics to university trustees and other top executives, but this was another time-consuming, manual effort. \u201cWe would run list reports or custom SQL extracts every other week and then manipulate the data in Excel; then we would put the graphical results into PowerPoint,\u201d Campbell says. The process took at least two days to complete. Not only did this take two full days of employee time, it also meant that executives were making decisions based on stale data. Finally, the international team had a difficult time finding reliable information about how Princeton alumni across the globe were interacting with University groups in general or the Office of Development, specifically. \u201cThey used their hunches a lot,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cAnd they were often very good. But we wanted to use data to validate those hunches.\u201d The Office of Development didn\u2019t realize it, but it already had the solution installed: Tableau. \u201cWe started using Tableau on our desktops in 2008,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cWe just used it for maps.\u201d In 2012 the Development Office made the decision to purchase several professional licenses providing direct access to the Oracle database. \u201cI think one of the reasons we didn\u2019t proceed sooner was a lack of understanding of the full benefits of the tool and a wariness of how much database support would be needed. In the end the benefits are far outweighing the cost,\" says Campbell. \"Although we are still playing catch-up with our database architecture and optimization to best support this direct query access, it\u2019s a paradigm shift in the right direction.\" Today, the Office of Development has three employees authoring data visualizations in Tableau Desktop and approximately 150 staffers and administrators consuming vizzes through Tableau Server. In addition to visualizing data from their Oracle database, Campbell\u2019s team also blends data stored in Excel. They have begun experimenting with blending data from the university\u2019s Exact Target digital marketing automation platform. Typically, the team visualizes approximately a million rows, although some dashboards have included up to 8 million rows of data. For security they use Active Directory. \u201cToday, it\u2019s all about the marriage between the art and the science of fundraising. With Tableau as a tool we're able to take some big steps in moving the science in field of fundraising forward,\u201d says Campbell. In particular, with Tableau the Office of Development has been able to:"

        "content": "More than 100 million customer interactions each day are facilitated through Genesys customer experience and contact center solutions. With more than 40 worldwide offices and more than 3,500 customers in 80 countries, Genesys works to deliver seamless, tailored customer experiences across multiple channels. In 2010, Genesys planted the seeds for a company-wide data revolution: the Genesys business intelligence (BI) team was established. The brand new BI team needed to show the business the value a dedicated business intelligence effort could offer. And the opportunity to impact the business was huge. \u201cI remember an executive\u2014he was dealing with an organization of 3,000 people at that time\u2014and he told us \u2018I need more information about who is working on what, how much I'm spending, what's the status of a project, what is the number of products, or even the number of employees!\u2019\u201d says Jean-Paul Saliou, Senior Director of Business Intelligence and Applications at Genesys. Unfortunately, the challenges facing the team were great as well. The new team did not have access to BI-specific tools, so they worked with already-available technologies such as Microsoft Excel and SharePoint. \u201cThe first months were about having proofs of concept and doing some homegrown things,\u201d remembers Saliou. \u201cIt was really about starting small, but thinking big. That\u2019s where we started with BI overall.\u201d The team quickly decided to look for better tools to manage and communicate the company\u2019s data.\n\u201cWe evaluated a few pieces of software and Tableau was one of them. We downloaded a trial and tested it. We were surprised\u2014in a good way,\u201d remembers Nicolas Gousakoff, Senior Business Intelligence Analyst at Genesys. \u201cIt was almost shocking, that we didn't find any limits to Tableau.\u201d In addition to Tableau, the BI team also considered QlikView and Jaspersoft. The business intelligence analysts wanted to purchase Tableau, but the nascent team\u2019s budget didn\u2019t match their vision. Instead they built the first BI platform at Genesys using open source technologies. It took approximately a year to build a library of dashboards and reports. \u201cWe were doing everything,\u201d explains Gousakoff. \u201cWe worked with the business on requirements, going back-and-forth, and then we created the dashboards entirely from scratch.\u201d Genesys business users and executives welcomed the data with open arms, and demand quickly outstripped the team\u2019s ability to produce. \u201cWe were a victim of our success,\u201d says Saliou. \u201cUnless we were going to hire more developers to work on the homegrown solution, we couldn't scale.\u201d The team hoped that a new BI platform would provide much-needed scalability while also addressing other issues. For example, some reports only updated monthly\u2014so decisions might be made based on month-old data. They also needed to meet an executive mandate to help Genesys become more data-driven across the company. As part of that effort, the BI team wanted to provide the Genesys sales team with a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for customer data insight. \u201cWe needed to create 360-degree customer view and have it accessible within Salesforce,\u201d Gousakoff says. The time was right to revisit Tableau. \u201cWe purchased a few Tableau Desktop licenses, and we decided to replace what had spent the previous year building and developing,\u201d says Saliou. The team was able to complete that task quickly, which garnered support for a larger deployment of Tableau, including a Tableau Server core implementation for publishing and sharing visualizations. \u201cWith Tableau Server, everybody in the company could have access to what we build,\u201d says Saliou. The team quickly realized that they could ease their workload by training business teams to author their own Tableau visualizations. Today, Genesys has more than 30 Tableau Desktop licenses across the company and hundreds of users consume published dashboards and visualizations through Tableau Server. The BI team has also been able to provide that \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d customer view to sales by embedding a Tableau dashboard into the company\u2019s Salesforce platform. \u201cThe 360-degree customer view provides almost a real-time view of what the customer has or needs. We have included information pulled from our systems\u2014ERP, CRM, defect tracking and so on. We have also allowed some homegrown algorithms. \u2018Can we sell more to this customer?\u2019 Or productivity analytics. It gives us a sense about what a customer needs and if we can do more for the customer,\u201d explains Gousakoff. 360-degree Customer View in Salesforce \u201cIt is available to all of the employees in offices across the world.\u201d he says. The team optimized the dashboard for mobile, knowing that many salespeople would be accessing it from iPads and other tablet computers. \u201cThat\u2019s very helpful; we want to be sure there would be no reason for them not to access the dashboard,\u201d says Saliou. \u201cOur executive team has had a clear goal for Genesys to become more data-driven across the company,\u201d says Saliou. The BI team has used Tableau to help accomplish that goal in many ways, including: \u201cIt's about the overall customer experience\u2014to continue to leverage our data to be increasingly customer-focused. Tableau helps us do that,\u201d says Saliou."

Even more time-consuming, the IT team needed to recreate dozens of reporting application interfaces, so that administrators and other users across UWF could access the specific information that they needed from the new system. \u201cWhen you go through a system conversion like that, the amount of work is almost unfathomable,\u201d says Melanie Haveard, Chief Technology Officer at UWF. \u201cWe built this system over 25 to 30 years, and it was perfectly tailored to what the users wanted. And we have to convert all of that in a two-year time frame to this new system that doesn't have all those bells and whistles.\u201d Each web application in the new system would need a reporting component that met users\u2019 exacting expectations. For example, says Haveard, a typical reporting request might be: \u201cI need this web application, and I need to be able to see that by department, and I need to be able to see that by faculty member, and it needs to do all of that sorting.\u201d Haveard\u2019s team also had to ensure users could continue to access to current student data throughout the conversion project. \u201cYou can't do a conversion like this all at once,\u201d says Haveard. Because data is converted in batches, some student data will be converted into Oracle while other information still resides in the SQL Server database. In order to have a complete view of current students, the IT team needed to be able to combine data from both databases into a cohesive view. It was also crucial that the data be correct\u2014or \u201cclean\u201d\u2014before it was transferred into the new system. Haveard points out that basing decisions on incorrect data undermines the decision-making process itself. If a decimal is left out of a single entry in a range, for example, that can throw off an average significantly. Haveard realized that she already had a tool that could help her team address these issues\u2014Tableau. UWF Visualization of Classroom Usage After its initial adoption of Tableau in 2008, the IT team quickly expanded its 15 Tableau Desktop licenses to a full core implementation of Tableau Server for publishing visualizations authored in Desktop. \u201cBefore the end of the first year, we already said, \u2018we know we love this product\u2014we're going to go for it,\u2019\u201d says Haveard. Today, there are 20 people at UWF using Tableau Desktop to author vizzes and roughly 100 people viewing and interacting with published visualizations through Tableau Server. Haveard has used the data visualization solution to address wide variety of issues. \u201cThe range of reports that I have produced varies widely,\u201d says Haveard. \u201cThings like helpdesk usage statistics, user analytics from our web portal, an analysis of classroom usage, and a look at a computer lab\u2019s student use metrics to help decide a facilities question. You name it; we've written a Tableau report that pulls it in.\u201d Computer Lab Usage Trends by Quarter As such, it\u2019s no surprise that she turned to Tableau to help with the newest challenge. Application developers have eliminated the need to spend time on reporting components because they are using Tableau as the reporting front-end. \u201cFor each application solution that we put out there, we are cutting at least half of the time off of it by having a companion Tableau workbook,\u201d says Haveard. \u201cWe\u2019re talking 4 to 5 weeks of time saved per application.\u201d Developers include a URL parameter within the application that links to the individual student. The Tableau visualization then includes that URL as an action, enabling users to navigate directly to individuals\u2019 update pages. \u201cOur web application is slimmed down with a lot less application development needed. That definitely frees the application developers to do more important things\u2014Tableau takes it all away.\u201d And the business users are so pleased that they have begun to request reports specifically in Tableau, according to Haveard \u201cThey're not just saying, \u2018I need a report.\u2019 They're saying, \u2018I need a Tableau report.\u2019 They already know that they need all the bells and whistles, and they need the ability to drill down to an individual\u2014they need all of that.\u201d UWF is also using Tableau to enable a complete view of student data\u2014no matter where it resides.\n\u201cWe were able to blend the data in Tableau, using the students\u2019 UWF IDs. So we can keep working during this transition,\u201d says Haveard. And what would they have done if Tableau didn\u2019t allow this data blending? \u201cI think we would have just been pivot table happy. We would have had to try to do stuff in Excel with pivot tables, which would have been not nearly as effective\u2014I can't even imagine!\u201d Haveard exclaims. Finally, visualizing the data before converting it is helping the team spot incorrect data entries. \u201cThe errors pop right out of the data,\u201d says Haveard. \u201cYou can tell when there are problems\u2014it's just immediately evident.\u201d For example, when producing a VP-level view of incoming student GPAs, the team realized that the range included 393\u2014an impossible score in a 4.0 scale. They were able to correct that metric to the correct 3.93\u2014and avoid a falsely-inflated average. \u201cWhen we\u2019re working with cleaner data on the front-end, then we can make better decisions,\u201d Haveard points out. Haveard and her team continue to expand their intentions for Tableau at UWF. Soon, they hope to begin visualizing graduate assistant\u2019s grades, department assignments, and assistantship award amounts. They are also planning to use Tableau to support retention studies in order to extend the benefits of the university\u2019s recruiting dollars."

        "title": "ASM Research: Mission accomplished with Army National Guard data",
        "company": "ASM Research ",
        "content": "For more than 30 years, ASM Research has provided professional services and IT solutions for federal, state, and local government entities in the US. In this video, ASM Project Manager Justin Repoli, Senior Application Developer Matt Boyer, and Data Analyst Scott Cochran discuss how they used Tableau in a recent project for a major client: the Army National Guard. Tableau: ASM Research provides a pretty wide range of services to government clients. Can you tell us about your work with the Army National Guard? Justin Repoli, Project Manager, ASM Research: We work with the Army, and we've been working with them for about 30 years on a particular contract. They accumulate massive amounts of data\u2014and they've been doing that for years. So we were looking at a product that can take that data, combine it and present it in a different manner for our client. Tableau: And is the Army National Guard able to use your visualizations to drive better decisions? Justin: One of the more recent projects that we did for the Army National Guard was to put a dashboard together using data from multiple sources. This resulted in a $20-million savings for the Army National Guard immediately upon deployment. Tableau: Wow. That\u2019s an incredible result. We assume they were pretty happy, then? Matt Boyer, Senior Application Developer: They were able to use the dashboard we deployed very easily. Scott Cochran, Data Analyst: They really liked being able to be able to drill down and see their data, starting from a high level to get to something useful. And that makes me feel great because it makes me feel like I\u2019m helping reduce the national debt. Tableau: What was the issue you were trying to solve? Matt: The Army National Guard has a very interesting set of problems. They have to train a large number of new recruits and existing soldiers every year. They need to send these people to training, they need to plan this training and they all have different points of view. Scott: So they wanted something where they could see an overview and then when they needed to, they could drill down and get to, say, a specific course or specific school that they needed to analyze further. Tableau: Can you describe the data environment? Justin: For this current contract that we're working on with the Army, there are probably more than 50 interfaces, so data is coming from multiple sources. It's in different formats. We're able to combine that and make it useful for the client by taking data from multiple sources, putting it into Tableau, and presenting it in a different manner that made it much more effective for our client. Matt: The Army National Guard has a 54-state model\u2014that includes territories\u2014and they don't want anybody from one state seeing the data in another state. At the same time, at the national level, they want to see all the data. So that's terribly important. Now, from my perspective, another huge part of the security would be authentication and the fact that we have to pass DOD security requirements. Justin: Security is a very important aspect of our everyday job when we deal with the Army. Tableau: Tell us more about that. How did Tableau play into the picture? Matt: We came across Tableau at the same time that we became a Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) level-2 shop. We've since become CMMI level 3. We started out and we had to apply to get Tableau Server put on the DOD Certificate of Networthiness (CoN) list. Tableau: How was your client analyzing its data before you came in with Tableau? Justin: The Army was used to taking Excel and data tables and putting that into a PowerPoint presentation. With Tableau, we put an actionable visualization in front of them and made something valuable that they were able to interact with. Scott: It used to take our clients a long time to analyze their data. Now with Tableau, they can see their data and very easily drill down to a specific training requirements\u2014specific courses, specific schools that they need to look at at that time. Justin: Very simply, Tableau has presented the data in a visual manner. It gives them something that they can use to drive returns. They can act on it and get results. And that's something that they can't really do with the typical data sources that they were using day to day. Tableau: And after they saw those visualizations, what were the next steps? Matt: The chief challenge\u2014and it was a very fun challenge\u2014was how we were going to take this cool dashboard and integrate it into a Web application so that everybody in the Guard could use it and benefit from it. We had to use the DOD smart card. We came up with a service-oriented architecture on how we could integrate Tableau in a service manner and integrate it into any of our applications and only have to do the customization once. Justin: We embed the Tableau solution within that system. So the main application that we've already established, which they already know how to log in to, is the one that trusts and authenticates the user and allows them to log in and see the dashboards that we've produced. Tableau: So what has the overall impact of Tableau been\u2014on this project and beyond? Justin: Once we put it out there, it generated ideas. They started thinking about new ways to use Tableau to answer some of their problems. It sells itself. It makes it easy for us to go to the client and say, \"This is a solution that we have for you.\" Matt: Tableau has come along and we can start to design dashboards. So we can start to visually show people what the real value in the data is. Scott: And for anybody considering Tableau, I would say \u2018Just jump right in\u2019 because it makes connecting to your data sources so easy. The ability to create visualizations is extremely simple and you can give your clients quality dashboards in the end."

        "content": "Tableau: Can you tell us a little bit about your customers and what your company does?\nRebecca Ratliff, Director of Operations at Usability Sciences: We serve a lot of Fortune 100 to Fortune 1000 companies in a number of industries, but primarily e-commerce and banking. The work that we do for all of these clients, we do online intercepts or surveys. And the problem that we're trying to solve from them is primarily usability issues. Tableau: And how does Tableau fit in?\nRebecca: What Tableau has done for us is allow analysts to really magnify what they can do for their clients in a very short period of time. Tableau: How so?\nRebecca: Our analysts were spending 80 percent of their time pushing data around in Excel, and 20 percent of their time putting together static PowerPoints and, you know, doing analysis. Analysts want to do analysis, not push data around. So now we spend 80 percent of our time on analysis. Now the analyst gets to spend time doing analysis. And for us, that's critical. And it allows us to not just do a two-dimensional pivot table, but to take a dashboard and look at so many variables at one time, and actually drill down to an individual user, click on that user, and actually display their click stream through the website to understand not only how did they answer the questions, but what was their experience on the website? Tableau: That\u2019s fantastic! What sort of insights are your analysts providing to your customers?\nRebecca: Our clients want their visitors to their websites to be able to have a seamless experience. If you think about the speed of the Internet today, how fast our clients have to make changes, utilizing Tableau in an interactive way to get rich insights for them and give them insightful recommendations on how to change their site so that they can increase their revenue has totally changed how we do business with our clients. We can collect data for a week now, put together dashboards and begin to show our clients what's actually happening on their website, where people are failing. So our role with them is even if we can move the needle a little bit, let's say during their checkout process or the checkout flow, if we can move the needle just a little for our large clients, it can mean millions of dollars a year. Tableau: Can you give us an example where this happened?\nRebecca: Okay, well, take for example, we were engaging with a site that primarily sold clothing items. And one of the insights that we gained through the research was that when people buy an article of clothing and they love it. Six months later, it was impossible for visitors to actually navigate and find that product. So we gave the recommendation to the client. The client now added in their search field the ability for someone to put the information in the tag, the product number (snaps), bingo, right to the product. That increased their sales by millions and millions of dollars per year, just that one insight. Tableau: So getting those insights faster must really help your clients! Are there other benefits you\u2019ve seen from your use of Tableau?\nRebecca: Tableau has changed not just our client's life, but Usability Sciences' life. The acquisition of clients completely changed. Clients are very impressed when they see Tableau. Everybody can roll out survey data, but taking survey data, putting it in a dashboard and interacting with your clients with a Tableau dashboard is very powerful. We had a lot of annual engagements. Tableau, and because of the power of Tableau, we now have clients that engage with us for multi-year engagements. All of those things were things that we didn't really anticipate, but have been a wonderful benefit of Tableau."

We are the world's largest supplier of slot machines and software to the casino industry. Tableau: Is the casino industry pretty data-driven?\nLon: A single slot machine spits out six to ten fields per hour multiplied by a thousand machines multiplied by 24 hours, multiplied by 365 days. So you're looking at about a billion fields per year that a single casino will analyze. Tableau: What sort of insights are you using Tableau to find in all that data?\nLon: In the past, we haven't had a real good insight as to why a slot machine performs well. To really drill down on the data and understand how individual machines perform in individual areas\u2014and even more importantly, how they perform in proximity to each other\u2014is extremely valuable.  That can help casino operators lay out their floor in a more strategic way, or to create areas that are more profitable or more appealing to the customers and improve the experience. Tableau: Whoa! That must present a lot of opportunities\u2014as well as challenges.\nLon: If you're a casino operator and you need information about how slot machines perform individually or about how your marketing programs are performing, you have access to very long data structures and a lot of information in a grid format. What you don't have is the ability to see that in an easily digestible format and to make actionable decisions. Using a product like Tableau, we can connect to that data very easily and turn that information over in a really easy-to-digest format. Tableau: That\u2019s great to hear! So tell us, what types of data are you working with in Tableau?\nLon: Most of the data that we use or that we get from our customers is structured in the SQL format. The problem is that a modern mega-resort can have up to a dozen different operating facilities, each one using a different type of data. For example, a food and beverage operator might use Micros, which is AS400-based. And then they may use a POS system that is XML-based. A product like Tableau helps us bring all that information together and blend it so that casinos can get a real 360-degree view of what their players and customers are experiencing. Tableau: Can you give us an example of a customer\u2019s data environment?\nLon: I have a casino that I work with that has been maintaining their data since 1999. Their database is 4.3 petabytes. By comparison, Mozilla's whole database for their entire user base of 100 million is 5 petabytes. So there's a lot of data out there that needs to be carefully analyzed, crunched, and turned into digestible formats. For storage they have a storage area network (SAN). Their management staff is very data-oriented. So they built out the SAN specifically for this. And literally every event that happens on a slot machine, whether it's a door-open or a jackpot or somebody putting their player's card in, is recorded and stored. Tableau: So having that much data is pretty typical. But once you get all your data into Tableau, what insights are you even looking for?\nLon: In the past, we haven't had a real good insight as to why a slot machine performs well. To really drill down on the data and understand how individual machines perform in individual areas\u2014and even more importantly, how they perform in proximity to each other\u2014is extremely valuable. That can help casino operators lay out their floor in a more strategic way, or to create areas that are more profitable or more appealing to the customers and improve the experience."

It helps keep and maintain efficiency when you're actually building dashboards. We do a lot of mock-ups in Tableau just because it's so fast to do it. Tableau Server helps us automate dashboarding for our clients, and this helps really free up time on certain people so that they can focus more on driving insights rather than building reports. Primarily at Merkle we use it for external clients, because we work with many clients day-to-day. We also use Tableau internally in the company. So we're building, operations reports, we're doing performance reports in Tableau, etc. Tableau: That\u2019s great to hear. You have some huge clients\u2014can we assume you\u2019re analyzing large volumes of data?\nDavid: At Merkle we deal with all sorts of data. We do big data, we do medium data, we do small data. We do all the data. Any one of those data pieces could be just as important as the other\u2014feeding it into a tool like Tableau so you can really explore that data \u2026 It just really helps. Tableau: Typically, what data sources do you connect to?\nDavid: There are a number of different data sources that we can connect to. We're connecting Tableau to SQL Server most of the time, but we also have Excel files and text files that we work with. We're connecting it to Salesforce internally in the company. Really the sky's the limit with Tableau. As long as you have data you can build it. Tableau: Do you blend data from different data sources?\nDavid: Yes. I can just connect to my data sources, I can say, \u2018All right, well, I want to take this thing from this data source, that thing from that data source and just blend the two together,\u2019 and it's \u2014 it's really fast and easy. Tableau: And you are using Tableau Server to share those dashboards?\nDavid: Tableau Server is a really great way to get a customer to go online, view and interact with their data. It could be a live connection, it could be an extract of the data or a snapshot of your data. And it's an easy way for an end user to just go, consume the data, get what they need to see, and then just get right out and start making those business decisions. Tableau: What is the benefit of sharing your dashboards this way?\nDavid: People love seeing that they can just go right into the dashboard, refresh it, and it's there. The data is there for them to see and use. So it really helps just create a better environment for consuming that data and making decisions off it. It's almost addicting to me! I just can't stop using the tool. Once I start developing, I just can't stop doing it. Tableau: We love to hear that! How is the reaction to Tableau within Merkle? Do your co-workers like it as much as your clients do?\nDavid: It's actually spreading like wildfire across our entire organization. There are people all over Merkle that are using Tableau, and every day it seems like I'm getting new requests for people to get Desktop licenses, because everyone just wants to get their hands on it. Tableau: Where did you first come across Tableau?\nDavid: I was actually first introduced to Tableau in business school. And I was in an IT class. We were learning different tools and technologies, and Tableau was one of the things that our professor encouraged us to look into. What I really love about Tableau is that not only is it accessible, it's also really visually aesthetic. I just love working in a tool and playing around with it. And the charts that Tableau can produce for you are just amazing."

Part of Grupo Bandeirantes de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, Band was founded in 1967. In these videos, Gabriel Queiroz, Business Intelligence Director, and Alexandre Porto, Marketing Analyst, for Band talk about the benefits of choosing a self-service business intelligence tool and how they are using Tableau to improve revenue and save time. Rede Banderientes delivers the power of information (video in Portuguese) Tableau: What is the benefit of enabling a self-service business intelligence tool?\nGabriel Queiroz, BI Director: Those that have to look after the business are those that are in the front, who are the managers. I am not a technology professional, you know? I'm a business and advertising professional. So, the self-service BI is like that, even though I don't have technical knowledge of computing, I can set up powerful visualizations to show the executives and also to use within my own department, while the IT team remains responsible for the maintenance of that database. Tableau: So as someone who is not an \u201cIT person\u201d \u2013 you are able to use self-service business intelligence tools like Tableau at Band?\nGabriel: With my knowledge of computing, I can set up powerful visualizations to show the executives and also to use within my own department, while the IT team remains responsible for the maintenance of that database. Tableau: How are people reacting when you show them Tableau visualizations?\nAlexandre Porto, Marketing Analyst: You look at a graphic, it tells you\u2014 very simply\u2014what you have to do, where to act, in that case there, where to sell your advertising space, what agencies you should prioritize. So, that was very well received, because people that never worked with numbers went on to understand those visualizations in very simple ways. Tableau:Can you give me an example of how Tableau is helping Band succeed?\nGabriel: So, Tableau now can give us insights, for example, of the average price of commercials per agency, per client. It can report clients that are advertising more on other stations than on Band, clients that have a greater or lesser revenue potential, from where we are extracting, really, the maximum from our business team. So, with the visualization of Tableau, we can have that type of insight in a very quick way. That is one of the great advantages of the tools, without a doubt. Tableau: If you had to point to the biggest benefit of Tableau at Band, what would you say?\nAlexandre: The main impact that Tableau had, in my opinion, on the Bandeirantes group, was to show how it was possible to understand complex data from different sources of information in a very simple way. Gabriel: Tableau can transform BI from a seven-headed beast within an organization. Tableau: Was Tableau Band\u2019s first business intelligence solution?\nGabriel: Well, when I arrived at Band five months ago, there was already a BI solution from another company. That solution was purchased five years before. And during those five years that solution managed to deliver very little to the level of, let's say, of the managers of the company. And with Tableau, during those five months, we managed to do much more work than those five years with the other tool. Tableau: Is Tableau helping you gain insight into your data faster?\nAlexandre: I think that I\u2014if I didn't have Tableau\u2014 I certainly would spend much more time and would need many more people helping to deliver that work. I would say that analyses, which probably I would take a week to do ... these days, I can do in one or two hours and it soon has a visualization ready, well formatted. You now can send it either to the client or to whomever asked you for it. Personally, I think that the greatest impact of Tableau came in the question of when I was going to a presentation to answer, one, two, three questions, with Tableau I began to go to those meetings, I would respond to the first, the second, the third question. It became much easier for you to dialog in a meeting. Tableau: Can you tell us a little bit about the data you\u2019re visualizing in Tableau?\nGabriel: The practicality of Tableau for us\u2014besides the fact that you can set up analyses very quickly\u2014 is the connectivity with various databases. That is very important. Tableau helps us a lot with problems related to transforming a large amount of information into visualizations, and Tableau can work with small, medium and large databases, you know? Which is our case. In Bandeirantes, we have two big information centers. One is private information, which is the information that we generate ourselves, internal management information. That is the space on television, radio, of all the vehicles, the billing by agency, by client, right? Very connected to the business area. So, that amount of information is very, very large. Besides that, we have another type of database, which is information that we buy, which is information that measures our audience performance ... so, much of it is connected to research institutions. And the great challenge is to merge those two information sources into one analysis. Tableau can do that very well for us. Tableau: What do you think other business people in Brazil should know about business intelligence and Tableau?\nGabriel: Because BI in Brazil is still something that is not totally widespread, companies are now beginning to look at BI in more detail. I have worked with Tableau for some years now, despite my having started in Bandeirantes now. It gives power, it delivers the power of information to everyone in the organization."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Founded in 1948, Allergan is a multi-specialty healthcare company that employs more than 11,000 people worldwide. Allergan operates in more than 100 countries, providing treatment options for patients in eye care, neurosciences, obesity intervention, medical aesthetics, medical dermatology and urologics. Joe Madigan is the Director of Customer Services for Allergan within the region comprising Europe, the Middle East and Asia (EMEA). Employees of the 12 customer service sites within EMEA ensure that orders for Allergan products\u2014received from healthcare providers via fax, email and phone\u2014are entered into the system within 24 hours. They also respond to customer queries and complaints. Allergan in EMEA generates roughly 1.5 million transaction lines a year across its 12 locations. While much of the company\u2019s data is stored in an enterprise SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse, each site had implemented a different contact center technology. \u201cWe strove to gain monthly insight into our customer service levels\u2014and we struggled with that,\u201d Madigan says. \u201cWe had almost no visibility of what was going on.\u201d Madigan requested monthly reports, run by the site\u2019s local IT teams. When reporting failed, Madigan\u2019s team would have to submit fix requests, creating even more delays. This posed a risk to the company\u2019s sales numbers. If service levels were not met, orders could be cancelled and providers would move to other treatments. This was a particular true for elective medical aesthetics procedures. Business users tried to get around this by emailing static reports. \u201cWe were sending out these Excel or .pdf reports, but business owners within the company would come back with questions because they can\u2019t interact with the data themselves,\u201d says Madigan. \u201cI needed to create dashboards in a way that would let us talk more about the data and less about the creation of it,\u201d says Madigan. \u201cWe were expending so much energy just redoing charts and graphs that we often were losing sight of what the data was saying to us.\u201d How much energy? \u201cThe data analyst I hired spent his time doing nothing else\u2014that is one full-time head. And I spent a day or two each month fully dedicated to working on dashboards and charts in preparation for my monthly meetings,\u201d he says. And when urgent, ad hoc requests occurred, they would impact other tasks by days or even weeks. Madigan also spent a great deal of time pulling and preparing data for his own reports and dashboards. For example, a compliance report Madigan completed every month required six hours simply to access and prepare the data. \u201cThe data set wasn't readily available. For our SAP database, you could sit there for two hours, waiting for a report to run. And a lot of the time, the first running of the report would bomb out,\u201d explains Madigan. In 2011, Allergan in EMEA made two changes that would transform how Madigan and his team see and understand their data. Allergan started a project to standardize all 12 customer service centers on a new contact solution, Genesys, which tracks voice, fax and email contacts with Allergan customers. And Madigan purchased Tableau for his data analyst. From a single Tableau Desktop license in 2009, Allergan in EMEA has grown to 20 Tableau Desktop and Desktop Professional licenses for authoring. Madigan\u2019s team most often works with extracts; a typical data extract comprises approximately 10 million rows. \u201cWe blend different data extracts as needed,\u201d says Madigan. \u201cFor SAP, I've got one big data extract on my transactions. I've got another one on my transaction lines. And then I've got another one, again, on my source of orders. I will blend all those quite frequently.\u201d Visualizations are uploaded to Tableau Server, and the team is teaching people to drill down into the data to answer their own questions. Madigan also has automated the production of his monthly compliance report, connecting Tableau to data on Box, the cloud storage solution. \u201cOne instance of Genesys sits over all of our locations; Tableau sits on top of the two Genesys databases\u2014SQL Server and Oracle. Tableau pulls that data and then blends it to provide nearly live service-level reporting,\u201d says Madigan. Allergan refreshes its Genesys data extract every 15 minutes. \u201cSome people said that Tableau wouldn't possibly be able to handle the complexity of the Oracle and SQL databases,\u201d Madigan recalls. \u201cI insisted that it would work fine\u2014and it has.\u201d Some users are interacting with Tableau visualizations on mobile devices. Madigan anticipates that number to increase once he and his team have addressed an internal VPN process that is slowing access. Today, nearly 200 people across Allergan in EMEA are regularly turning to Tableau visualizations for insight. For authentication, Allergan uses a combination of Trusted Ticket and Okta. Madigan\u2019s team uses Tableau to visualize data from Google Analytics and Salesforce; they are looking into using the Salesforce direct connector. In terms of ROI, Madigan says \u201cThe value is certainly returned in a month, probably even less than that. I don\u2019t even hesitate to say \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d Over the last year, Madigan has sparked interest in Tableau in several other departments at Allergan. \u201cAs I\u2019ve been out in the various offices responding to queries and being able to produce answers very, very quickly\u2014people are seeing that and becoming interested in Tableau as well,\u201d he says. The data quality team, based in London, recently purchased 20 licenses for Tableau Desktop; the ophthalmology finance team recently moved from QlikView to Tableau. Madigan will be demonstrating Tableau to the medical aesthetics finance team in the near future. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those tools\u2014Tableau goes across all business lines. It\u2019s not business-line specific or function-specific. It just goes across all,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me to receive requests from other directors or even VPs saying, \u2018Can you show me? Can you demo it?\u2019 \u2014that has certainly never happened with any other tool,\u201d says Madigan. Madigan says that the improved insight into the data means that his team can respond to the rapidly-growing business more effectively. \u201cOur revenue is growing double digits as a region. For our mature countries, we've grown our transaction volume by 50 percent with no incremental head count,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we hadn't been able to see what was going on, we would have erred on the safe side and added more resources\u2014at least ten heads\u2014to cope with our growing business. So having this ability to get into the data and pull it all together means that we're much more in control of what's going on.\" \u201cWe don't have a queue of requests anymore, so our data analyst is able to respond more quickly to ad hoc queries and to more value-add requests,\u201d says Madigan.\nMadigan shares the example of a recent, urgent request for data to support a tax audit in a particular region. \u201cPreviously this would have had a negative impact on all the other things our analyst was doing, but we don\u2019t have that anymore. There might be a slight delay but not in terms of days or weeks as there would have been in the past,\u201d says Madigan. \u201cThere\u2019s an availability of data and an ability to respond quickly to requests that just wasn\u2019t there before. \u201cThe compliance report has gone from six hours of work once a month is down to 30 minutes now. That\u2019s every month\u2014and that\u2019s just one report. If you were to look at all the various compliance things that we've got to do just on a monthly basis to stay on top of things, you can see where there's been a big benefit.\u201d Madigan is able to answer questions much faster now, too. \u201cA question will come up and I'll be able to answer it in ten seconds, instead of having to go and ask for a report and having the answer a day or two later.\u201d Madigan has also enjoyed a bit of a professional reputation for being \u201cthe man with the answers\u201d thanks to Tableau. \u201cFor me, as the Director for Customer Services, instead of having to ask someone for data, I\u2019ve got it right there. And I hear the feedback: \u2018Oh, Joe knows the answer. He\u2019s got the data.\u2019\u201d \u201cI literally use Tableau every day. There is not a day that goes by that I don't use Tableau,\u201d Madigan says. \u201cI still think we're only scratching the surface in terms of what we can do.\u201d"

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Thousands of commercial airlines, airport operators, travel agents and civil aviation institutions rely on TravelSky Technology Limited for business intelligence and market information on the massive air travel industry in China. TravelSky monitors everything from air passenger flow and distribution to Internet travel platform usage in the market serving 300 million air travelers per year. It also has its sights on overall business competitiveness and industry development. TravelSky, which has spent the last 30 years fine-tuning its service offering, now provides a comprehensive and powerful information service line and a multi-tier information system to industry players. \u201cMy team of nine analysts closely monitors the air travel industry in China,\u201d says Joyce Yu, senior manager at TravelSky, \u201cWe measure key indicators in the industry and track all aspects of business development.\u201d The team regularly sieves through 10 terabytes of data consisting almost 100 million rows to pinpoint key performance indicators and unveil any developing trends in the industry. They compile all these into reports and present them to close to 100 client service representatives spread across China. The customer representatives and their customers rely on information provided by Yu\u2019s team when they make crucial business decisions in resource planning, flight planning, business projection, etc. Yu says Tableau has been a tremendous help as she and her team are now able to present a clear and concise picture showing nationwide commercial air travel patterns and trends in a very timely manner. Time taken from data to reporting has shortened tremendously despite the TravelSky team currently presenting a much more analytical and in-depth view of the data.\n\u201cPrior to adopting Tableau, two specialists on my team who monitors market competition would take the first two weeks of each month to compile, sort and present their data to our clients,\u201d adds Yu. \u201cThese days, they take just one day to sort the data and drop them into Tableau. They then use Tableau to present an analytical view of the data and highlight major developments and competitive trends in the industry. We use another day to check the information to make sure they it is accurate before releasing it to our clients.\u201d Yu acknowledges that her team is able to provide much more value using Tableau as they now present detailed analytical reports with a point-of-view -- such as highlighting problem areas and alerting on challenges ahead -- compared to delivering raw sets of data in the past. Through Tableau Server, they are also able to create multiple sites, each presenting a different analytical view that is of interest to a particular group of clients. For instance, what is most relevant to airport operators may not be as interesting to commercial airline administrators. Clients are able to interact with the Tableau dashboards, asking questions and getting the answers that they need. This has raised overall user experience and her team\u2019s level of service. They have moved from basic data delivery to knowledge sharing, according to Yu. Another benefit for TravelSky is the time savings. In less than a year, Yu\u2019s team has introduced five new analytical reports designed for different clients. This would not have been possible without Tableau. \u201cI estimate an overall of 90 percent improvement in time efficiency since using Tableau,\u201d says Yu. \u201cThis translates to getting the information out to clients faster, which can have significant impact on their businesses. They rely on the information to make decisions and every minute counts in the travel industry.\u201d Furthermore, Yu is very pleased that her team has received positive feedback from their clients. Clients have commended them on the reports saying that they have exceeded expectations. The team\u2019s clients also like it that the analysis and information is easy to read and understand, and this is especially useful to users who are new to their role or to the industry. TravelSky was looking for a suitable solution to help them crunch the large amount of data before they heard about Tableau from contacts in the travel and tourism industry. Representatives from the industry often get together to exchange ideas and share best practices and it was through these sessions that Yu found out about Tableau. \u201cWe were, at that time, looking for a suitable business intelligence solution to help us delve deeper into the data that we already collect,\u201d Yu explains.\u201cWe evaluated a few possible solutions, including some traditional business intelligence tools, and were really impressed with how Tableau was able to get us results in a very short time.\u201d Yu\u2019s team found Tableau to be an invaluable tool for extracting useful information when working with big data. However, she points out that it can be challenging for new users to fully gain control and get the most out of Tableau because of its flexibility. TravelSky set up a dedicated committee to explore and try out the product initially. The team studied many online case studies from various industries and extracted what was useful. The information was consolidated into a knowledge pool to be shared within the organization. Yu advises that this is a faster way to get results from Tableau compared to having everyone trying out the product on their own. Users author interactive visualizations using Tableau Desktop Professional. TravelSky also taps on Tableau Server to effectively deliver reports to users based in different cities across China. The TravelSky team is exploring the potential to use Tableau Server\u2019s mobile capabilities to deliver visualizations to mobile devices such as the Apple iPad. They are investigating if there is a demand from clients and how mobility can benefit them in their operation. Today, clients can log in and interact with the dashboards using an Internet browser. They can access the reports and ask questions and get the information they need from the visualizations. \u201cEach client can look at the same set of data in a different way to get specific, or even new, information that they require,\u201d adds Yu."

For production, it's helping hour by hour, minute to minute, you know\u2014\u201cAm I hitting my numbers for this hour?\" And if I'm not\u2014why not?\u201d Tableau: How is Tableau helping with that?\nWill: If you're trying to root-cause some nagging issue that's been kind of hurting production for weeks or months, looking into that data and seeing things we've never seen before has been a big win. Tableau: And are you able to do that sort of root-cause analysis for challenges with no obvious solution?\nWill: Well, we were just looking at data that we've only recently been able to look at. Looking at it in a different way showed us stuff that was totally surprising and which guided us finally in the right direction to solve the issue. Tableau: Wow! Let\u2019s take a step back\u2014tell us a little about Tesla\u2019s data environment. How does it fit with Tableau?\nWill: We have data in a bunch of different sources. So being able to connect to multiple data sources, being able to do some blending, being able to use the extract API to connect different databases together. This provides us a ton of value right now with no effort from IT. Tableau: Since implementing Tableau, how has your data become more manageable?\nWill: You know, now someone can come to me in the hallway, talk to me about something they want to see, and sometimes I can publish a Tableau report in three hours after that. You know, not weeks, but hours. You know, this guy came and asked me for something he's been thinking about for the last couple of months and I made it for him in 30 minutes. He was blown away. So, the speed of making, publishing, and sharing with folks has just vastly accelerated. Tableau: And are more people able to share and get insights from data now?\nWill: So now\u2014instead of having this small team of great engineers working on it with tons of other stuff on their plate\u2014if we can provide the tool set, provide reports to a broad number of people, they can be answering their own questions, they can be looking at the stuff that I might never have known existed. Tableau: It sounds like Tableau is really empowering people across the organization. Can you tell us more about that?\nWill: Once you start giving access to data to people, they start asking you more questions. And there\u2019s the ability to kind of dig deeper. So I think there is a huge opportunity to provide a self-reliant environment for us, and a big key is making that self-reliant environment responsibly self-reliant. One of the big things I enjoy about Tableau is that we can give people the power to connect to data, but they can be either taught or they can be provided with a published data connection that is a good data connection. It's not giving them all the power in the world to go break something, it's giving them responsible power to do what they want to do. Tableau: And how has that affected collaboration at Tesla?\nWill: I think it's starting to unify a lot of different groups in Tesla looking at the same data, using the same reports, coming up with similar best practices. Before, kind of everyone got their data in whatever way they could; it was kind of split up in these little buckets. You e-mailed whoever you knew. Now, this is kind of leading the charge in a much more integrated effort, a cohesive effort in terms of our reporting, our analysis, you know, the way we look at data. Tableau: How has it benefitted you? What do you enjoy about the software?\nWill: Professionally, using Tableau has connected me with a lot more people. I get called down to the vehicle line to help them with their Tableau reports.\nTableau is often empowering to use. No\u2014it's a mix of empowering and also it's that adventure of exploration that I think is a big part of it. A lot of the point is exploring the data that's out there, being surprised continually. Tableau: Overall, how have teams as Tesla been impacted by Tableau?\nWill: If we didn't have Tableau today, I think we'd be going backwards. I think we'd be taking a step backwards. I know I would be not doing my job as well or as fast or as efficient. I wouldn\u2019t be able to share stuff with people as easily. It's a scary thought because I've been working with it for six months and I can't imagine going back."

        "company": "Genesys",
        "content": "Tableau: A business like Genesys must encounter a lot of data. Before implementing Tableau, how was Genesys consuming its data?\nAnthony Chamberas, Director of Business Intelligence: The only way to get information from the Genesys platform was through basically database dumps of raw data. There was no real good way to consume the data. Excel was the primary tool. So they just needed a better solution for manipulating and analyzing data. Tableau: So what prompted the company to eventually try out Tableau?\nAnthony: One of our employees saw Tableau Public on a website, said this is exactly what we need, and he convinced his boss to buy a copy, and then took off from there. Tableau: And you came to the company pretty soon after that, right? Tell us a little about your start at Genesys.\nAnthony: I was actually hired into Genesys because of my background in Tableau. I had no idea coming into this job\u2014I started about a year ago\u2014of really how the whole communication process worked when you\u2019re dealing with a platform like ours. Tableau: Right, so Genesys helps businesses improve outbound communications to their customers. How does Tableau play into that?\nAnthony: The time that I'm recapturing with Tableau, what I'm able to do is really focus on understanding what the customers' needs are, whether it's an internal customer or an external customer, really listening to their problems and what they're trying to achieve, their business objectives, and figuring out, you know, how we can influence or change that outcome by using better information. Tableau: And some of that process must include your own intuitions about customer interactions. How does Genesys use Tableau to expand upon its hunches about customer behavior?\nAnthony: Well, one view that allows us to test some of the hunch is with respect to what we call scripting. So once we get someone on the phone what are we saying to them? There's usually an automated message, and is there a certain point when people lose interest or hang up, et cetera. Tableau: How does that help you improve phone calls to customers?\nAnthony: What we want to see is a slow deterioration. If we see a big drop at a certain point it means that the script or the message is saying something that is upsetting people or turning them away. So we want to investigate what\u2014what\u2019s being said at that moment and what can we do to change it. Tableau: And how do you communicate that information to your business clients?\nAnthony: Some of the functionality we built in here was to package up reports and e-mail them out. So we do a lot of that. And what we're trying to move towards, those customers that are using Tableau already, for them to connect to our server using their own Tableau Desktop licenses. Tableau: It sounds like Tableau is helping you communicate faster and better with clients. Can you tell us a little more about the time Genesys saves by using Tableau?\nAnthony: So there are several different time savings. The first one is really just its ease of use. It's a lot easier to get information in a consumable format using a tool like Tableau as opposed to Excel or some more enterprise-wide, big, heavy BI solutions. So that's one immediate time savings. The other is really just the speed at which we can iterate and improve the campaigns, as we call them, the outbound communications. We're able to much more quickly identify where opportunities might be, whether it's calling a different time of day or calling a mobile device or sending a text message rather than calling. Tableau: So let\u2019s return to that visualization for customer phone calls. How did you share the insights you get from that analysis?\nAnthony: So it's that kind of insight that was surprising to me, and it also validated a lot of what my coworkers kind of knew but could never really show. So it really brought us both together, again having this conversation, communicating, coming from two different worlds, the data and Tableau in the middle did that for us. Tableau: It sounds like Tableau is really benefiting your business and its communications with clients. Can you tell us more about that?\nAnthony: Being able to visualize data is definitely changing the relationship with our clients. So we're no longer talking about how they can get data or talking in a vacuum of how we can make improvements. Now we can have conversations with them about what we see and how we can improve, and\u2014and we can very easily. Tableau: And what have been the personal benefits for you in using Tableau?\nAnthony: So the difference for me in having a tool with Tableau is it takes me out of the space of becoming a developer or being a developer and becoming more of an analyst, which is really what I want to do as a professional, how I want to grow as a professional, so I can focus more on the business problems rather\u2014rather than the technical problems."

Tableau was really the only one that followed through on making it as easy as the website made it seem. Tableau: How did the trial go?\nMat: During that 14-day time period, we were able to not only re-create all of the dashboards that we were already doing and they updated much faster, but we also built several new ones. So by the time it was over, we went to our director for approval and it was probably the easiest approval we've ever got because the\u2014the ROI was already there after 14 days. Tableau: That\u2019s great! That must have been a good meeting.\nMat: We had scheduled the meeting for approval for about an hour. We spent about ten minutes getting approval and then the next 15 minutes playing with the reports. So it went over perfectly. So we bought two licenses, and then about four weeks later, we bought 20 licenses all on Desktop. Tableau: And you originally intended to use Tableau just internally. But what happened after that?\nMat: What we started finding was that it was so easy to build reports that we felt were visually compelling that we wanted to actually start showing it to hotels. Tableau: What was the response when you started showing them those reports?\nMat: So we started with a few hotels and maybe two or three reports. And then we showed it to a few more and to a few more. What we found was that within 60 days, we had 300 hotels that were asking for these reports once a week. So then we had a\u2014a great problem to have, which was we couldn't keep up with the demand, we couldn't send them fast enough. Tableau: Wow! So we understand you implemented Tableau Server not too long after that. How did that process go?\nMat: We went through a proof of concept with IT around Server and also around other BI tools. And what it came down to at the end was that the business side and the users really wanted Tableau because of what we were able to do with it, and that's what drove the decision. Tableau: Tell us what that did for your increased demand.\nMat: So, right now, we're generating literally thousands of reports every week and distributing them out to hotels with very little to no effort on our part because Server is able to generate them automatically for us. Tableau: How has this changed your business?\nMat: We've gone from really just being a support-based role to providing proactive recommendations to all of our franchise hotels without adding any additional staff or any additional cost to our franchise hotels. Tableau: Has Tableau allowed you to solve other business challenges?\nMat: You know, a very good example is that we had one of our senior executive members ask for a very complex visualization. We wouldn't have even been able to answer the question before\u2014let alone how long it would have taken to answer it. It took us an hour to put together a visualization and send it back. We are now able to answer business questions in minutes versus days. Tableau: So overall, what has been the impact of Tableau on Carlson Rezidor Hotels?\nMat: It's just been a huge game-changer for us. So instead of having to wait for something to already happen and then try to figure out why it happened, we're now proactively looking out and we can see what's going to happen before it happens and then prepare for that or maybe change it."

        "title": "SpareBank 1 Anticipates Opportunity for $40 Million Over Three Years Using Tableau",
        "company": "SpareBank 1",
        "content": "Forty million dollars. That is the revenue opportunity SpareBank 1 Forsikring expects to realize over three years using Tableau Software. One of the largest providers in the Norwegian financial services market, SpareBank 1 Forsikring has deployed Tableau visual analytics in its insurance subsidiary to answer questions in minutes. The sporting motto fits neatly with the SpareBank 1 Forsikring strategy. The $114 billion group is an alliance of independent Norwegian regional savings banks that have joined forces to exploit economies of scale and improve services to millions of customers across Norway. To be competitive, the life and non-life insurance division of SpareBank 1 Forsikring needs to know as much as possible about its customers: how they relate to each other, what policies and products they own and their agents or brokers. That\u2019s a tough call in this market. Norwegian insurance companies like SpareBank 1 Forsikring are up against formidable challenges, including wafer-thin operating margins, the commoditization of traditional insurance products and increasing competition from new players such as the online insurance \u201csupermarkets.\u201d Changing consumer demographics and behaviour, together with dramatic regulatory changes, are adding pressure in an already challenging business climate. Until recently, SpareBank 1 Forsikring relied on a static reporting environment to piece together knowledge about customers, products and the market situation. \u201cIf you wanted an ad hoc report into a particular insurance scenario, you would order it and then wait about two weeks for the spreadsheet to turn up,\u201d explains Dagfinn Roed, who is responsible for business intelligence at SpareBank 1 Forsikring. \u201cAll the reports were static, fixed and usually out of date by the time they reached the decision makers.\u201d This approach to reporting was not only reactive, it also was costly. Vast amounts of time and resources were devoted to aggregating data from the SAS data warehouse, preparing reports in the required format and then submitting them. Each bank in the alliance also needed a different format for the report, so the same report was sometimes re-formatted as many as 20 times. As part of a new enterprise data warehouse strategy, the Norwegian insurance giant began the search for a visual tool to perform both analytical insurance intelligence and market analysis. The Gartner Magic Quadrant was used to identify five alternative solutions, with the shortlist quickly coming down to just two: Tableau and QlikView from QlikTech. SpareBank 1 Forsikring chose Tableau Desktop licenses after seeing its agility and ease-of-use. \u201cWith Tableau, teams from the business could create their own reports in minutes; whereas QlikView required significant intervention from IT staff,\u201d says Eystein Kleivenes, business intelligence team leader at SpareBank 1 Forsikring. \u201cCompared with Tableau, QlikView was also tricky to learn.\u201d More than 70 SpareBank 1 Forsikring staff now use Tableau to visualize their data. The company has transformed its approach to insurance data, from data creation to how it is viewed and used in cross-team collaboration. To develop and deploy an effective solution, SpareBank 1 Forsikring turned to RAV, a Norwegian Tableau technology partner. RAV provided support, implementation services and expertise on everything from structuring data sources to best practices for effective visual communication. This agile, visual analytics solution enables SpareBank 1 Forsikring to deliver the right data to identify new cross-sell opportunities, improve customer service, manage risk, ensure compliance, and lower the cost of doing business across the entire group. In one report, for example, the insurance company can compile a view of the number of insurance products each customer has, their demographics, geography, historical profile and win/loss rates. Reports like these are used both at an operational and at an executive level for strategic decision making. With Tableau, SpareBank 1 Forsikring has rapid-fire answers to basic and complex questions like these\u2014in minutes: \u201cThis improved portfolio monitoring, coupled with improved knowledge of our customers and better pricing decisions has the potential to add more than $40 million to SpareBank 1 Forsikring\u2019s revenues between 2015 and 2018,\u201d says Roed. For many years, SpareBank 1 Forsikring assumed that young drivers were the least profitable customers to insure. After all, they are less experienced behind the wheel and therefore more likely to raise an insurance claim for damage to their own or a third-party vehicle. Using Tableau visual analytics, the insurance company identified that this young group of drivers is in fact among the most profitable of all its motoring customers. Armed with this information, SpareBank 1 Forsikring has been able to adjust its pricing strategy and introduce new tightly targeted marketing campaigns encouraging more policies to be taken out. \u201cWe always had that data, but once we visualized it, everything became clear,\u201d says Roed. To cut the cost of their motoring insurance premiums, many parents insure themselves as the main driver of their child\u2019s car, with the child listed as a named driver. This practice, known as \u2018fronting\u2019 drives premiums down and costs the insurance industry a lot of money, despite the heightened risk from the young driver. A visualisation of which customers are doing this, enables SpareBank 1 Forsikring to monitor the situation and help drivers to insure appropriately. \u201cIt used to take us up to one week to find out issues about insured drivers, but now we can reach the answer in minutes. Sales, marketing and customer support teams can all generate visualisations themselves, with very little training and without requiring technical support,\u201d says Roed. Consider decisions about insurance pricing policy. SpareBank 1 Forsikring managers meet regularly to review and re-assess the life and non-life price tariffs. Using the SAS reporting methodology, it took five days to prepare the reports; now they are ready in half an hour. As a result, the insurer is able to adjust its pricing structure immediately\u2014and benefit from an instant uplift in revenue. \u201cPeople use data more than they ever used to,\u201d says Kleivenes. Performance of the Tableau visual analytics environment is outstanding too. Roed and his team used to struggle with the slow SAS-ODBC connection to the data warehouse, which delayed analysis. A recent switch to an IBM Netezza database has transformed performance, with the analytics available in a fraction of the time it took using SAS. Kleivenes concludes, \u201cWhen I do Tableau training presentations and show people the power of the visual analytics solution, I get a round of applause. People are astounded by what Tableau can do. We\u2019re making data accessible to everyone\u2014and helping them get answers as fast as they can think of questions.\u201d"

Using Tableau allows us and allows our clients to expedite that data to decision path. Tableau: How much data do you analyze for your customers?\nFeras: You don't have to be a Fortune 100 today to be overwhelmed with data. we have clients that have half a billion hits a month of worth of Web data. That's a lot of data. And so we slice it and dice it easily in Tableau. Tableau: Wow that is a lot. How did you handle it before Tableau?\nFeras: So before using Tableau, we would have to extract the data, say, out of Google Analytics into \u2014 into CSV file and to Excel, massage it, trend it, it takes \u2014 maybe a report could take up to two hours. It could take\u2014we could save about 75 percent of that time with Tableau. Tableau: Are there other benefits to using Tableau? Feras: With Tableau, I can pull in my mobile data, I can pull in my Google Analytics data. I can pull in my social data. I can pull in my Salesforce and CRM data and see that 360\u00b0 view of that prospect and the customer. This is very, very actionable. When you can stitch in data from the CRM, from Salesforce and report on qualified leads\u2014that's really key. As a demand generation marketer, then I can report on where my qualified leads are coming from. Tableau: Are there other ways that you are helping your customers make more data-driven marketing choices?\nFeras: We take our customers\u2019 data and we slice it and dice it easily in Tableau. And then we can report \u2014say at a geography level. You can then add more context to the data. Feras: For example, we can overlay the population, let's say in California, and see the percentage of the population that \u2014 maybe who are converting at a much higher rate in a specific city, and then maybe target them with a specific promotion. With websites where you have, you know, millions and millions of hits, it's really hard to report on in CSV or in Excel. So Tableau allows us to pull this data in and segment it by geography."

        "title": "Vertex Services improves global understanding with Tableau",
        "company": "Vertex Services",
        "content": "As a truly worldwide company\u2014Vertex has operations in every continent except Antarctica\u2014the company struggled with accessing and sharing the data stored in disparate sources. \u201cThis is a rather diverse group,\u201d explains Edmund Lai, CFO, Vertex Services. \u201cAnd we operate through a number of individually-owned companies. So it's a vast network of entities spanning various regions.\u201d The company does not have a centralized data warehouse, but rather diverse, discrete applications located across the globe. Many systems, including accounting and order processing were duplicated or split between the US and Hong Kong offices. Vertex also operates a number of different portals through which partners share data; data from this partner portal was maintained in its own discrete database. \u201cTo pull it all together to start understanding and using the data has been a challenge,\u201d Lai says. Understandably, this also added time to the decision-making process. \u201cWhen the management in the US looked for numbers generated from Asia, we had to deal with the time difference issue. Also we had to wait for the number crunchers to take up all the information and process it, and make it in a meaningful way to present. And that often may take one or two days,\u201d Lai explains. \u201cWhen you have a decision where you want a rapid thing or users have a small thing that you want to check on, to wait for two days is too long.\u201d Another challenge is that the primary analytics and reporting tool for the company was Microsoft Excel. \u201cExcel reports are static,\u201d says Lou Smith, National Accounts Senior Manager. \u201cI know I could hand my boss a pivot table with a bunch of numbers and he\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m trying to tell him\u2014but it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time.\u201d Lai agrees, saying \u201cThe people we are talking to are decision-makers in the organization. When we had them look at the Excel spreadsheet, the first thing they would say is, \u2018Can you make it simple and make it appear on one sheet of paper?\u2019 And sometimes it's just impossible to present a summary with its full glory in one sheet of paper using Excel.\u201d Excel also did not lend itself to the iterative questioning process that leads to true insight. As a result, often decisions were made based on assumptions or educated guesses. Smith often ran into this issue when looking at performance data in reference to Vertex\u2019s largest customer, The Home Depot. Smith compiled two years\u2019 worth of Home Depot advertising information to help answer some of these questions, but sharing that information with his colleagues was hit-or-miss. Another Home Depot-specific issue that Smith faced was preparing for the yearly manager\u2019s meeting. They walk around by district and everybody wants to know how they're doing. \u2018How am I doing this year? Am I doing better than this other store?\u2019\u201d Smith could request Vertex product sales data from Home Depot and analyze it in an Excel spreadsheet\u2014but that would take days of effort. And he knew that Excel would be an unwieldy tool for trying to answer on-the-spot questions at the meeting. Lai and his team had been considering finding a new BI solution when The Home Depot announced that it would begin sharing sales data with its vendors. Vertex understood the strategic value of that sales data. \u201cIt helps us make decisions for what we're going to suggest to The Home Depot, and for where we should be moving our business,\u201d says Smith. Vertex began its search by looking at the traditional enterprise players. \u201cOur consultants were recommending the standard software, like \u2018Oh, maybe you want to look at Oracle, maybe you want to look at SAP or IBM Cognos,\u2019\u201d says Lai. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018If I had that much budget, that would be great. But to start people getting more interested I need something which has a much lower barrier for us to get over that hurdle.\" Vertex next considered Microsoft, but quickly realized it would be too difficult to use for most of the Vertex users. \u201cMicrosoft came in and said, \u2018Okay, we can actually use SharePoint and Excel and start doing a lot more with your data,\u2019\u201d Lai recalls. \u201cBut the thing is\u2014to get it to the simplicity and the quick responsiveness we needed, it takes a lot of skill. And that skill level may not be present right now within our organization. I know I can buy it, I can hire somebody to do it, but to have people using a more simple solution\u2026that\u2019s what we needed,\u201d he says. Vertex\u2019s IT contractor in Hong Kong suggested that they take a look at Tableau. Lai and his team quickly realized they found their BI solution. \u201cAt the end we chose Tableau because of its ease of application, its nimbleness, and really\u2014it is just very simple to use,\u201d says Lai. Vertex purchased its first Tableau Desktop licenses in June of 2012. \u201cOur first goal was the crack the diversity of our data and to try to manage it in a meaningful way, so that we can start analyzing it,\u201d says Lai. \u201cRegularly now, we pull over 100,000 lines of data from various databases and blend it together. And we can form a meaningful picture of things that we have done in the past 18 to 24 months.\u201d Lai\u2019s team is now working to create a data queue for its wholesale order processing system.\nToday, the Asian offices of Vertex have two consistent Tableau authors; in the U.S., Smith is the primary Tableau author. All authors create packaged workbooks for Vertex leadership, who consume the visualizations using the free Tableau Reader application. They are also beginning to share analytics with some customers, including The Home Depot. Smith and Lai expect these numbers to grow after Vertex implements Tableau Server, a project which has already begun. In addition, Lai is working on a project to integrate Tableau with the Vertex SharePoint site.\nMany of the Vertex leaders use mobile devices to consume the packaged workbooks. \u201cThat was one of the things I liked about Tableau when I first started hearing about it,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI know I build my workbooks with that in mind: \u2018I want to be able to make this so that you can read this on an iPad.\u2019\u201d Lai and Smith agree that their use of Tableau is helping to enable more data-driven decisions within Vertex. \u201cAs a globally-dispersed company, to have one set of data and be able to manipulate it so that it fits in more views is allowing us to have a new way of communicating,\u201d says Lai. \u201cRather than looking at different reports created for different people, today we have one set of data with different views. We can see the same thing and actually refer to the same underlying issues.\u201d Users now can focus on their particular areas while also gaining insight into other parts of the business that they might not have understood as well in the past. \u201cI never really looked at the financial side of company. And Edmund, he may not have been as engaged as what happens at a Home Depot store level,\u201d says Smith. \u201cSo now it gives us a chance to tie those together.\u201d This also offers a time savings benefit. \u201cNow that we can tie it all together with Tableau a lot faster, we can generate more meaningful reports\u2014and we can do that in a much faster time frame,\u201d says Smith. Lai estimates that users are getting answers from days to two weeks faster, depending on the question. One of the most satisfying wins for Smith is the response he received to his Tableau visualizations at the Home Depot manager\u2019s meeting this past year. \u201cWe absolutely blew them away. We could tell them what they had in their store, we could tell them what they did for any time period, all the way down to the SKU level,\u201d Smith recalls. \u201cThere was not a question they could ask that we could not answer.\u201d He estimates that trying to create a report in Excel that would have allowed similar insight would have taken weeks or even months. \u201cIt would have been very time-intensive to build it,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWith Tableau, I just create a hierarchy and sort SKUs into categories. Then I can click on that category and it will tell me every SKU in the category by store. I could have all that data in Excel, but I would not have been able to access it as quickly as I did or answer questions as quickly as I did.\u201d Interactive Tableau dashboards and visualizations are allowing Vertex management to have more productive discussions.\nThe ability to drill down to the underlying data, says Lai, \u201callows us to go down to the root cause a lot easier, a lot quicker,\u201d says Lai. This is also saving time for Vertex leadership. \u201cWe can have interactive discussions and when we are discussing issues we can go through the data and instantly\u2014rather than asking for somebody else or asking for the data and waiting for it to come back\u2014instantly we have that feedback of \u2018This is what we want,\u2019\u201d says Lai. \u201cWith Tableau, the answer just jumps out from the data. It's almost as if it's telling us some story.\u201d Lai recalls a specific conversation in which one of these \u201cjumps\u201d occurred. \u201cRecently we had a discussion with an executive vice president of Home Depot about the supply chain; we have got a highly volatile and fluctuating demand and supply situation,\u201d says Lai. The team created a visualization of the supply situation over time. The CEO of Vertex took the visualization to the executive vice president of Home Depot to drive home the message about the volatility of the supply situation. \u201cWe chose to use Tableau; that made the story much, much more powerful because you can actually see the highs and the lows,\u201d says Lai. \u201cIt brought home the message that we wanted to tell Home Depot. And having that interactivity and the simple presentation made it a much, much more pleasant conversation.\u201d \u201cNow we have got a set of data which talks back to us to say, \u2018Hey, guys, look: this is the real pattern,\u2019 or \u2018The answer is not what you thought\u2019,\u201d says Lai. \u201cThat really changed the scenario. And it actually draws a lot of other users, gets them interested in what we are doing.\u201d Tableau\u2019s interactivity, says Lai, is a big part of the reason that users are so receptive to the data visualizations and to the story being told. For example, Smith says that the ad data that he has collected for two years is being more effectively used now that he has included that information in a Tableau visualization. The visualization can be sorted by country and date. When a user clicks on a specific advertising date, an image of the actual ad that ran can be viewed. \u201cHaving the ad information in Tableau is much more visual, and it makes more sense to people. It's more accessible. It's not just me saying, \u2018Oh, the Yukon oak was advertised that month.\u2019 You can click on the visualization and you can see the ad. And people are more apt to use it,\u201d he says. \u201cI use Tableau. I look at it every day. It's really made me think differently about my job,\u201d he explains."

        "content": "The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) protects Minnesota\u2019s natural environment through monitoring, clean-up, regulation enforcement, policy development and education. The MPCA strives to meet the highest levels of transparency and accountability; to that end the agency has established a data analysis unit to respond to ad hoc information requests. The team chose Tableau to help them answer questions faster and more completely, and to further adoption of a data-driven culture within the MPCA. Minnesota has robust legislation regarding open records, so all state agencies are held to high standards regarding transparency and governmental accountability. The MPCA Data Analysis team was established to respond to research questions and data requests from both internal clients\u2014such as other staff members and agency leadership\u2014and from external clients including policymakers and concerned citizens. \u201cBy law, we have high standards for data accessibility\u2014it is a priority to provide the information unless we are required by law to keep it private,\u201d says Leslie Goldsmith, data analysis supervisor at Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). She points out that MPCA data is both highly interesting and highly public, making a focus for both citizens and politicians alike. \u201cIf you can't provide an answer, people may become concerned that you\u2019re hiding something. Or they worry that you are not competent. That creates unnecessary noise in the discussion,\u201d she explains. When requests come from politicians, the team must ensure that it is being clear and transparent about the data on which its analysis is based. \u201cIf you've provided an answer for a particular hearing, for example, you want to be able to reproduce that answer,\u201d Goldsmith explains. \u201cTypically when a concerned citizen asks a question, they just want an answer. But our policymakers not only want an answer, they want to see the data so they can have their staff verify it.\u201d The Data Analysis team is also focused on helping the agency further its efforts to be a data-driven organization. \u201cWe would run into situations where you'd get a different answer out of a question each time, based on who was answering the question,\u201d says Goldsmith. Part of the team\u2019s mission was to help establish consistent and truthful answers. \u201cWe help people differentiate between data that was truly missing and data that exists\u2014but they just don\u2019t know how to get at it,\u201d says Goldsmith. \u201cOr people will bring us their box of data and say, \u2018Can you make something interesting out of this?\u2019\u201d That \u201cbox of data\u201d typically comprises two different types of data: field data (in some cases, literally so) about environmental conditions and stressors, and organizational data such as performance metrics, counts of works in progress, and data about milestone events. The data is also stored across a number of data sources, including Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Esri Database, Access, and Excel and PostgreSQL. \u201cData is stored everywhere in the agency. It's not as central as one might hope,\u201d says Goldsmith. Some questions come up routinely, such as the number and monetary value of actions the MPCA has taken against industries. \u201cWe seem to get that question every month,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd each time the requester asks for it a slightly different way than the way it was asked the month before. If you have to constantly pull the data through an Access query or you need to hit the database\u2014it's redundant with previous work and it takes time.\u201d After accessing the data, the team still needs to put it in a useable format. \u201cMany people don't like spreadsheets\u2014they get lost in all the numbers. We wanted to take all of these different kinds of data and make some decent pictures from them. And if you tried to do that in Excel, you had to get out the big hammer and your format blew up and seven people wanted it 18 different ways!\u201d says Goldsmith with a laugh. \u201cThat makes it really hard to be productive.\u201d She estimates that the process of making presentable graphs using data from Excel and Access took about two hours for each report. And those two hours would be spent each time the report was refreshed\u2014some daily, others weekly or monthly. In 2007, Goldsmith went looking for a better tool and ran across a mention of Tableau.\nAs a longtime proponent of visual analysis, Goldsmith remembered reading about Tableau back when it was still a research project at Stanford. Intrigued, Goldsmith arranged for a few trials of Tableau Desktop 4.\n\u201cI used it in the trial and was doing something useful with it 20 minutes out of the box,\u201d says Goldsmith. \u201cWe have never looked back.\u201d The team has been using Tableau for nearly five years, starting with Tableau Desktop 4 and quickly moving to Tableau Server 4 and then upgrading with each new release. The MPCA team is now using Tableau Server 8. The MPCA has 18 analysts authoring visualizations in Tableau Desktop and publishing them agency-wide through Tableau Server. All 900 agency employees can access and interact with visualizations published to Server. The agency uses Active Directory to control access to dashboards and visualizations. Goldsmith believes that Tableau helps the MPCA meet its goals for governmental transparency and accountability. \u201cWe have 2,600 workbooks created over the last five years, and many of them have been answers to those one-off questions,\u201d says Goldsmith. \u201cWhen someone contacts us and asks us to do something, we try to say \u2018yes.\u2019 And we tend to say \u2018yes\u2019 with Tableau.\u201d For example, her team built an automatically updated workbook around enforcement efforts. This allows the agency to respond rapidly and consistently to questions from the public, the press or politicians. \u201cThis workbook shows how many enforcement actions we've taken, the value of those actions, and the environmental benefit of those enforcement actions. So it makes it really easy to respond to questions,\u201d she says. She also appreciates that Tableau enables her to share not just the analysis, but also the data behind it. \u201cThe packaged workbook is a great way to bundle together the static picture\u2014the table and the data behind the visualization\u2014at a particular point in time, so you do have reproducibility and good data lineage,\u201d she says. Tableau\u2019s ability to produce speedy analysis plus underlying data also helps to allay fears and suspicions that occur when answers are incomplete or take too long to produce. The team is using Tableau as an important tool to forward a data-driven culture within the agency. \u201cA lot of these questions that we can answer with Tableau\u2014otherwise they would be considered impenetrable and unanswerable. \u2018Gee, if only we could answer that but c'est la vie; we can't,\u2019\u201d she says. Goldsmith considers Tableau\u2019s flexibility in connecting to various data sources to be particularly helpful. \u201cWhen people brought us that box of data, Tableau is a great tool for that kind of flexibility,\u201d says Goldsmith. \u201cYou can dive into the data and play with it and explore it really fast.\u201d The team also uses Tableau to help educate agency groups about the importance of quality data. \u201cWhen you talk to people and you show them a table or spreadsheet, it doesn't always click. But if you visualize it\u2014it\u2019s so much more impactful,\u201d says Goldsmith. \u201cWhen managers see a timeline starting at 1392 because someone made a data entry error, they get it.\u201d Goldsmith is confident that using Tableau has improved her team\u2019s productivity. She estimates that it would take two hours simply to pull the data and determine the answer\u2014formatting the response would take another hour or two. \u201cWe save about a half-hour to an hour for each question,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don't have to spend that time, that tedious horribleness that comes with other tools.\u201d \u201cA couple of hours in Tableau, and the response is prepped, ready for consumption. And it's connected to the data so I never have to do it again,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can produce stuff that can be used over and over,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly helpful in high-demand areas.\u201d She continues, \u201cIn terms of ROI, I estimate that it takes about 40 hours of saved labor to start getting actual, measurable return on the cost of a Tableau Desktop license. Anybody who uses Tableau much\u2014they are probably going to be in pure return after a couple of months.\u201d \"Without Tableau, we would be working a whole lot harder to accomplish a whole lot less.\u201d"

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Melbourne-based start-up, Brand Village, aims to help retail clients build customer loyalty through better insight into the in-store shopping experience. \u201cWe\u2019re soliciting customer feedback in retail, primarily,\u201d explains Ian Curry, Operations Partner with Brand Village. \u201cCustomers go into a retail store and have an experience\u2014good or bad. We will give the shopper something that directs them to a website survey focused on the in-store experience.\u201d Brand Village will then analyse and report its findings back to the retailer\u2019s head office and at the store level. Retailers can then use the analysis to fine-tune their overall strategies for improved brand loyalty, advocacy with customers\u2014and better sales, too. Brand Village needed to select a data analysis solution that could handle survey data well, but that was only the start of the requirements list. Curry and his business partner\u2014who together have nearly 20 years of experience working with data in various forms\u2014knew from the start they wanted to break away from the industry-standard solutions they had used in the past. \u201cWe were looking for something that did things a little differently to what the traditional survey packages would do,\u201d Curry says. \u201cOverseas, this sort of analysis is really big, but it\u2019s a little newer here. One challenge is helping people to see that this data is actually going to be useful to them.\u201d Finding a solution with the ability to present survey data clearly and impressively would be crucial to the growth and success Brand Village. \u201cWe need to impress our prospective customers, so we want that \u2018wow factor\u2019 when presenting survey findings. We need people to be able to effortlessly see and understand the data being presented,\u201d Curry says. The winning solution would also offer the flexibility to adjust presentations according to customer demands and offer sufficient power to turn around analysis quickly. Finally, Curry and his partner wanted to be able to share results with retailers securely and easily across a number of devices, including tablet computers such as the Apple iPad. Brand Village investigated a couple of different survey analysis tools but the choice to go with Tableau was an easy one, according to Curry. \u201cWe considered other options, but they were generally cumbersome and simply didn\u2019t look as good as Tableau did,\u201d said Curry. \u201cAs soon as we looked at Tableau we knew we had found our solution.\u201d Curry is the primary author of data visualisations for Brand Village. He authors the analysis in Tableau Desktop and then publishes his work to Tableau Cloud, the new cloud-based solution for easily and securely sharing visualisations. They also embed Tableau visualisations on the Brand Village website for customer demonstrations. \u201cI\u2019m finding Tableau is unbelievably good at handling the data and I\u2019m really impressed with the speed of it. I\u2019ve built a lot of custom databases in my time and I\u2019ve never been able to reproduce anything as good as I\u2019ve been able to using Tableau,\u201d says Curry. In addition to being pleased with Tableau Desktop\u2019s powerful data visualisation and analytical capabilities, Curry is impressed with its dashboard function and flexibility. \u201cWe\u2019re able to modify how we present data to our clients based on their individual preferences,\u201d Curry says. In comparison with his previous work using Access, Curry says that he can build a client-ready solution months faster. \u201cBuilding in Access, that might take me two to three months to get something up and running to the standard they need,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Tableau I could probably spend a week or less putting something together and it\u2019s pretty close to what the needs are\u2026 It\u2019s all there, it\u2019s just a matter of learning the intricacies.\u201d Curry also appreciates how easily customers will be able to access Brand Village visualisations and answer their own questions on-the-fly. \u201cOur customers will be able to manipulate and interact with the data themselves via Tableau Cloud using their iPads or PCs,\u201d says Curry. Curry is able to show key metrics such as net promoter score. For big chains, Brand Village can clearly present data at a national, state or a regional level. Clients can also see how an individual store is performing compared to a national benchmark and track trends over time. Curry and his business partner are still working hard on the initial start-up phase of business. Curry has been working on building the front-end interface while his partner is talking to as many prospects as possible, using Tableau to show them what kind of store level insights they would receive. \u201cAt this stage we\u2019re talking to people and presenting them with data in a way they can instantly see what they\u2019ll get out of it. We take along the iPad and let them flick through the data and show them how quick and easy it is to interact with. It\u2019s a really good way of showing them what they could be doing.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to have at least 10 or 15 clients by mid next year, and to have 50 to 100 stores interacting with their data using Tableau Cloud,\u201d says Curry. \u201cIn future we\u2019ll also look at moving to Tableau Server.\u201d Curry confirms that Tableau is integral to Brand Village\u2019s success. \u201cWe\u2019re doing things differently and Tableau is essential to that. Tableau enables us to present and analyse research in a very different way. I don\u2019t think the market has seen anything like this yet and Tableau is a real key to that.\u201d"

Tell me about the scope of data that you\u2019re dealing with.\nAdam Yeoman, Senior Analyst, Supply Chain Development, Tesco: At Tesco, we have over 3,000 stores in the U.K., and the average store will have over 15,000 products. So it's a huge amount of data to try to look at all at once. We use a Teradata data warehouse to hold most of our data, and it has a 100-terabyte capacity. We keep on it five years of sales, waste, product, store level (data.) We've found that we just have connected Tableau live to the Teradata and it just works really well. Tableau: How is Tableau helping you be more effective?\nAdam: So visualizing that (data) in the clever ways that Tableau allows you to, you can quickly spot trends or areas that could be easily improved. Now when we're trying to communicate ideas, it can be a lot faster, a lot easier to just show them visually rather than trying to explain it through just tables and numbers. I think retail lends itself to data visualization particularly well because a lot of the trends we see are different in different areas around the country. A warm day up in Scotland won't feel like a warm day down on the South coast. And so you get very different things happening based on where a store is\u2014and Tableau lets us see that. Tableau: How do you use that information?\nAdam: We try to improve the customer experience by either improving availability or the quality of products that they buy in store by looking at the end-to-end supply chain from getting the products from the suppliers into the stores. Tableau: Can you give me an example?\nAdam: We developed a weather model to predict effects of weather on sales. And as part of that, we got really good at predicting when an event that we called the \"hot weekend\" would occur, when the weather starts getting nice and everyone decides that they're going to have a barbecue on this particular weekend. So we want to make sure we get all the barbecue foods and salad and rolls into the stores in time for that weekend. And we knew that -- we knew from previous hot weekends that there were some stores that we could improve on and provide better availability for customers. We put the data into Tableau, and just showing that on a map, you instantly see, \u201cOh, these are the stores in which we need to be doing a better job.\u201d Another use of Tableau that we found was a stock trial that we knew from looking at results we saw that London stores were behaving differently to stores around the country. And we needed to communicate this message to directors. We put those results onto a Tableau with just basically colored dots on the map and took that to them. And the directors could really quickly see what the problem was and move the conversation straight on to the solution that we had in place to deal with that. Tableau: That\u2019s great to hear. Are you finding that it\u2019s more developers or business users working with Tableau?\nAdam: Tableau has great potential in Tesco because some teams don't have people with the skills to be able to write custom SQL, and Tableau can really open up data for them. Tableau: How about for you? What sort of difference do you see now that you have Tableau?\nAdam: I'm finding it's a lot faster to get analysis done, and more enjoyable. I'm freed up from manipulating the data into certain formats and just being able to drag and drop and see trends easily is a great benefit."

By night, Lee dons another title: football \u2018fanalyst.\u2019 \u201cI look for the gaps between the commercial sector and the people that work in football all the time, and I try to find clever ways to exploit freely available public data to create insight,\u201d he explains. A life-long fan of Liverpool Football Club, Lee\u2019s fanalyst efforts began after the club brought in a director of football strategy whose mission was to offer data-driven strategy recommendations. \u201cI was so excited about the possibility of, effectively, a data scientist having his day in the hot seat with some power and influence...that didn\u2019t play out as I wanted it to,\u201d Lee says.\nThe financial and opportunity cost of that failed experiment spurred Lee to take data into his own hands. \u201cI wanted to try to do something different to see what could be done without the funds and the influence\u2026 just as a challenge, I guess,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought I could bring the skills and knowledge I\u2019ve built in my day job and apply those to something that everyone can gauge, which is football.\u201d Lee specializes in using publicly-available, free data that he can review and combine in clever ways to derive value. \u201cI try to find things that have really wide coverage but that people aren't looking at; I can turn this into something valuable\u2014weaving gold from lead,\u201d he says. Lee began using Tableau and Tableau Public to create and share his football analyses.\n\u201cI think that's what set me apart actually,\u201d he says. \u201cI don't think there were many people using Tableau Public to surface football data insights when I started doing it.\u201d Lee\u2019s analyses have begun to draw attention on social media, most notably Forbes.com\n\u201cWe (Liverpool) had a problem scoring goals, and I did a piece that looked at public data to identify across Europe a whole range of insights about goal scores to see if I could find players that were perhaps undervalued but highly capable in that department.\u201d\nLee was surprised at the amount of attention he gained on social media for his football analysis. \u201cIt went pretty wild on social media. I got a mention on Forbes.com as one of the top grassroots football analytics writers of 2012,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was cool; I didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d\nAnd the attention didn\u2019t stop online; Lee has been contacted by clubs and football organizations eager to discuss his work. \u201cEngaging with the football industry as a whole\u2014the clubs and the data providers that work with them\u2014has been really fun and really interesting. It's certainly added a lot of depth and context to the work that I'm doing,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWhen you have scarce resources and limited budgets you have to be creative to make an impact,\u201d Lee points out. \u201cIn my case I couldn\u2019t afford to buy the kind of content that I would have probably gone to straightaway if I could have afforded it. Because I couldn't, I had to take a different path.\u201d \u201cAnd what I found is that I can actually navigate between the gaps that these companies overlook, and when I put all the little pieces together I end up with something quite powerful. Each piece on its own isn't that important but when you synthesize it and you surface it effectively and simply, you get really, really good responses.\u201d"

        "content": "Valyoo, a New Delhi-headquartered e-commerce company, specializes in category-specific online shopping destinations. Valyoo currently maintains four sites: LensKart for optical products; WatchKart for quality time pieces; BagsKart for purses and bags; and JewelsKart for jewelry. All of Valyoo\u2019s sites have experienced rapid growth in the past year. A data-driven company from the beginning, Valyoo wanted to increase its reporting efficiency, help managers make decisions faster, and keep up with increased reporting demands without hiring additional staffers. Since its inception in 2010, Valyoo management has been focused on the numbers. And they credit that focus with helping to drive the company\u2019s amazing success\u2014Valyoo has grown from roughly 100 employees to 500 in little more than a year. In early 2012, the analytics team was using Access and Excel to meet reporting needs\u2014and Nikhil Doegar, Head of Business Intelligence & Analytics for Valyoo could see that demand would quickly outstrip what his five-person team could produce using these tools. \u201cIn a company growing at 20, 30 percent month over month, if managers were to keep depending on the analytics team to build them data, by the time they got the data it would be very late,\u201d Doegar says. \u201cLike any e-commerce company, we have a lot of data. As an analytics team, it's very difficult when every time somebody has a requirement, you have to go into the database, pull out data, and then create something for them and send it to them.\u201d For a typical request, for example, the team would pull data out of the Microsoft SQL Server database and then create pivot tables in Excel. He estimates that his team spent approximately four hours per day building these repeated reports with fresh data. In general, Valyoo is a very data-driven company. \u201cThe culture is such that they want to see all the numbers,\u201d explains Doegar. \u201cWhen management looks at reports, they are really focused on seeing the actual, absolute numbers.\u201d For example, the company closely watches Google Analytics data to understand its customers\u2019 behavior on-site. The faster the analytics team could process the data and report on it, the sooner senior leadership at the company could make strategic decisions. While the team got this information out as soon as possible, Doegar knew the manual process could be improved. Doegar began his search for a better solution, and he had a very clear idea of his requirements. \u201cOur goal was to get an automated tool which firstly would help users to get the data real-time without having to come to the analytics team. Secondly, to make users able to visually understand the data and not just have an Excel sheet or a data dump in front of them. And third, each department in our company depends a lot on data. So we have to be able to develop a dedicated dashboard for each team where they can look at the data and have everything to help them make decisions going forward.\u201d In addition to Tableau, Valyoo considered QlikView from QlikTech. \u201cWe evaluated both QlikView and Tableau. We used the Tableau 14-day trial and we thought it was easier to implement and it fulfilled all our requirements,\u201d says Doegar. \u201cWe just tried to replicate some reports which we already had in Excel. It worked pretty well\u2014it refreshed automatically, no one had to spend time pulling data and refreshing it.\u201d The team is using Tableau Desktop to author its visual reports; Valyoo is using Tableau Server to more easily share interactive data visualizations. The company trialed Tableau 7 but quickly migrated to Tableau 8 when it was released a month after the initial purchase. Most of the company\u2019s reporting has been developed in Tableau 8. All in all, Doegar found the migration straight-forward. \u201cThere were some initial settings and things which obviously we did not know, but then the sales partners in India, Corporate Renaissance Group (CRG), helped us set it up. It was a fairly easy process, not very difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cAs an e-commerce company, the biggest feature which has helped us is Tableau\u2019s integration with Google Analytics,\u201d says Doegar. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s helpful in many other industries as well, but it is our bread and butter. Having Google Analytics information integrated with our BI tool is a big thing for us\u2014it helps us figure out who are the people buying and who are the people not buying, and if they're not buying, what is the reason for that.\u201d Doegar says that his team is using the Google Analytics direct connector \u201cquite a bit.\u201d And he notes that while they see opportunities for future improvement, the team is finding Google Analytics with Tableau to be much more efficient than the prior Excel-based method.\nDoegar is pleased that any visualizations his team produces through Tableau include the ability to drill-down into the raw data. \u201cThe underlying data, the ability to look at that is used quite a lot in our company,\u201d says Doegar. \u201cUsers are looking a lot at the data behind the graphs and behind the cross-tabs.\u201d\nIn fact, Doegar says that Valyoo has been able to further propagate its existing data-driven culture through Tableau. \u201cWe would never make our decision without the data. But Tableau has made it all that easier to get that data,\u201d says Doegar. \u201cEven if we were not using Tableau we would still be focused on the data, but maybe it would have taken longer to make the same decisions, or it would just be harder to get that data.\u201d This has allowed managers to be more self-sufficient as well. \u201cManagers within the company are now more independent in terms of making data decisions,\u201d says Doegar. \u201cThey do not have to depend on the analytics team or the business intelligence team to support them in terms of data; we create a dashboard for them and then they are fairly self-reliant.\u201d Tableau has helped the team continue to support the rapidly-growing company while remaining quite small. \u201cIn terms of Tableau helping us to support 500 people\u2014it's about the bandwidth of the team. If the tool wasn't right today, the analytics team might be a 20-people team just to support the business. But today we are able to do that with four or five people,\u201d he says. Another distinct improvement is the automatic refresh capabilities in Tableau Server, which has enabled Valyoo to automate many standard reports that used to take half the day to re-build with new data. \u201cWe keep putting our reports over there (on Tableau Server) and users keep refreshing. We do our work on Desktop, publish reports, and Tableau Server does the rest for us,\u201d says Doegar. \u201cWe've been able to save about four and a half hours per day in employee hours.\u201d\nOver a typical month, that means that the analytics team is seeing a savings of more than 90 hours. Additionally, business users save, on average, an hour a day thanks to Doegar\u2019s team\u2019s ability to provide access to updated data. \u201cManagers within the company are now more independent in terms of making data decisions,\u201d says Doegar. \u201cThey do not have to depend on the analytics team or the business intelligence team to support them; we create a dashboard for them and then they are fairly self-reliant. \u201c\n\u201cThey are able to focus more on the strategic decisions instead of having to run around to trying to get the data themselves,\u201d says Doegar. The analytics team is able to get daily data to decision makers faster now, too. \u201cWe can see data earlier in the day\u2014at least two hours sooner, on average\u201d says Doegar. And the analytics team is not only providing data earlier, but the quantity and quality of the data has improved, all of which helps Valyoo leadership drive towards continued success. \u201cOnce you know what is selling, then you can start focusing the right items and you stop focusing on the others. So it helps a lot,\u201d Doegar says."

        "content": "Tableau: How does using Tableau fit into the culture of Dell?\nRobert Ayala, Senior Financial Consultant, Dell: One of the key drivers we use to champion the vision for this business intelligence initiative around Tableau is a quote from Michael Dell\u2019s book Direct from Dell that \u201cWhen you're making decisions from the gut and not based on data, you're really leading your company down a difficult and dangerous path, particularly in difficult economic times.\u201d Tableau has really allowed us to change the mindset internally within our company about what's possible in terms of collaborating with analytic tools. With Tableau, we're finding the really subject matter experts in analytics across the functions are now starting to collaborate and they're starting to produce analysis that really brings together disparate data sources in new and interesting ways, and creating insights that are producing a lot of aha moments. Tableau: What sort of issues are you tackling with Tableau?\nRobert: Our financial organization is dealing with a lot of complexity in terms of where our data exists. In addition to all of the functional areas that have made different business decisions on how to warehouse their data over time, we've recently gone through a number of acquisitions that have added additional complexity. Tableau has just been really excellent about helping us consolidate that data and bring meaningful insight to the business as we go through the integration process. For starters, we have to rapidly produce P&L statements during a really consolidated closed cycle. Tableau allows us to really rapidly pull that together. Even in terms of ensuring data integrity, Tableau\u2019s advanced visualizations really allow us to see anomalies in the data, and to do that data cleansing, and give us more time to really prepare how we address the entire consolidation. Tableau: How are people working differently because of Tableau?\nRobert: Our team members were spending 75 percent of their time collecting and cleansing data and getting it ready, and about 25 percent of their time actually analyzing the data. And we've really seen a flipping of those ratios. So, we're getting more value out of our people through tools like Tableau. Tableau: How does that impact how people feel about their jobs?\nRobert: Our real subject matter experts embraced Tableau when they realized it allows them to play in the space they originally went after in terms of their career objectives. A lot of analysts end up having to deal with things like metadata management and data warehousing issues. When you get a tool that allows them to focus on their real core skill set and potentiate what they're good at, they embrace that readily. Now that they're able to connect to disparate data sources and produce new and insightful visuals, they're excited about their career opportunities and what they can do to benefit the bottom line for the company. Tableau: What\u2019s the benefit of self-service analytics at Dell?\nRobert: Dell has been on an interesting journey and we've seen a lot of investments that we've made over the past few years in terms of our data warehouse and master data management and governance and infrastructure. And we've actually seen by implementing tools like Tableau it's allowed the benefits curve to really accelerate rapidly. Now we've got the tools in the hands of the people who have the creativity, the knowledge and the understanding of how the business operates and how the data is structured to be able to produce something meaningful and insightful. Tableau: Can you give us an example of how your analysts use Tableau?\nRobert: In terms of a real specific example, this last cycle we got some really insightful questions from our investor relations organizations around some growth that was taking place in a particular business unit. And we were able to use Tableau to go in and really identify the key core products that were driving this growth. We were able to take a look at our workforce data and see the teams that were responsible for delivering that product; we were able to take a look at our sales pipeline and see how that ramped over time\u2014and what it looked like for future quarters. In terms of product profitability, we were able to give some really precise feedback to our investor relations team. Tableau: How did you implement Tableau at Dell?\nRobert: I was the first internal user of Tableau for a task-driven activity; I had a specific deliverable. And Tableau\u2019s value proposition became immediately clear to me. I saw that there was an even greater value in enabling my peer group to have that same type of capability to drive data discovery and data visualizations that make the learning around the analytics precognitive. You can look at a picture and it tells you something without having to really do the math inside your head. And so we started to build Tableau out as a grassroots effort. Pretty quickly, our IT organization saw the value proposition of shifting content ownership to the business, and it's been just a very collaborative approach internally since. Tableau: Who uses Tableau at Dell these days?\nRobert: We've seen a very diverse group across the entire functional area of Dell\u2014HR, finance, operations, all of the functional areas. It has spanned the grade levels as well\u2014 from the analysts all the way up to the executive leadership. Tableau: What is your data environment like at Dell?\nRobert: I continue to be surprised at all of the different data environments that my peers across all of the functions have to navigate in order to get their jobs done. Some of them are very structured environments, some are in a warehouse, and others are in various states of evolution along that trail. We've definitely recognized that the tools that are more flexible, like Tableau, allow us to access data from a variety of different places and also shift that content ownership to the end users, which is just so powerful in terms of our ability to succeed moving forward. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted you personally?\nRobert: I think the most exciting part for me about using Tableau is it's really allowed me to discover a passion inside of me that I get from enabling end users. Even more so than producing something exciting, seeing a community of people produce meaningful and exciting thing. I'm actually the user group leader for the Austin Tableau User Group, and I've started to working with a lot of nonprofit companies in terms of helping them see the possibilities of leveraging analytics to discover new and insightful ways around their business as well. The exciting part about being the Austin Tableau User Group leader is that I get to see this community of practitioners all representing different companies with different products and objectives and different functional areas across their organizations. And they are all faced with the same type of data challenges and the same objective of trying to produce meaningful insight from the mountains of data that they deal with on a daily basis. The bar has been raised in terms of what people see as the possibilities of the analytics they can produce."

        "content": "Tableau: What do you appreciate most about Tableau\u2019s capabilities at Hanesbrands?\nSantiago Restrepo, Director of Business Intelligence and Analytics: Tableau is so easy to use and the insights that you can generate from it are a lot better than what you can do with other traditional tools. You can save a lot of time by generating reports, by generating new ways to visualize information. Doing those with other tools will take 10 to 20 times as long. And the quality of the insight and the take-aways that you can generate is never gonna be the same. Tableau: What sort of solutions are you creating with Tableau?\nSantiago: We\u2019ve done a lot of great work using Tableau on top of consumer segmentation schema information, classifying each U.S. household into one of different consumer segments. We've used that information to discover which the best stores for placing our products are and where to do promotions or assortments. I see Tableau becoming a tool for exploratory data analysis that's being used by the people in the business marketing sales supply chain that are analytical and they want to use their data and have access to it. So I see Tableau becoming that tool that people use to generate their own insights and their own data. Tableau: How did Hanesbrands get started and grow adoption of Tableau?\nSantiago: When I moved to Hanesbrands, I introduced them to Tableau. From there, it's been a great success and a great improvement in providing better capabilities for analytics and visualizations. We started using it in marketing, but from there, it has spread to the finance area, the supply chain area and category management. It just continues to spread like wildfire across the whole organization. We decided to upgrade to Tableau Server so everybody has access to it. We have a good way to track the usage, make sure that the data is secured and people have the right access. And people just access the Tableau Server from any browser and from any iPad\u2014 that's how we've been able to expand the usage of the tool. Tableau: How are people benefiting from Tableau analytics?\nSantiago: They're able to analyze a lot of information. We have point-of-sale data by SKU, by store, by week or by day for all of our trade partners. Our data set is billions and billions of rows. Before Tableau, it was very hard to make good sense of that data and that information. But now, we're able to use Tableau on top of it and be able to create better insights and make more fact-based decisions. Tableau: Where do you store your data?\nSantiago: We store the majority of our data in SQL Server. We have Analysis Servers as cubes, and we use Tableau as the main reporting tool connecting to the cubes, or creating extracts out of the cubes or out of the database itself. We connect Tableau to those extracts or to those data sets. It works really well. It's scalable. We have a huge amount of information, and we can use Tableau to analyze it and to extract the information and the insights from it. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted how people work?\nSantiago: Before Tableau, we were spending 80 percent of our time cleaning up the data or making it usable, and just 20 percent of the time generating reports or dashboards. But that flipped totally. Right now with Tableau, we\u2019re generating the data and cleaning it up is so much quicker. We're able to dedicate 80 percent of our time to understanding the information better, discovering better insights and making better business decisions."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau Software is transforming the way the research teams of the Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019Energie Atomique (CEA, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission) analyzes its research data. This French government-funded technology research organization is a prominent player in the European research arena. CEA, working with its partner Mydral, has standardized on Tableau in its Life Sciences division to accelerate and streamline the reporting and analysis of viral infections such as AIDS, and emerging diseases like influenza, dengue and Chikungunya. Big data analysis is now quick and commonplace, with compelling visual reports available anywhere in the research organization within minutes, compared with days or even weeks previously. According to the researchers of CEA\u2019s division of immune-virology, \u201cTableau is the equivalent of having an extra member on the research staff\u201d. While Tableau can\u2019t take credit for shrinking the time it takes CEA to develop treatments for viruses, it is shrinking the over-arching decision making process. How does a massive research organization gain a rapid visual understanding of its investigations? That was the challenge facing the immuno-virology division of the CEA in Fontenay-aux-Roses. The organization\u2019s mission is to explore and develop vaccine treatment strategies for chronic and emerging viral infections. Until recently the answer to that question lay with various reporting systems and processes. The research groups relied on different and fragmented silos of research data. This led to the team devoting unnecessary time to compiling the data reporting\u2014as opposed to actually analysing the data and experimenting with models to combat viruses. Antonio Cosma, a research scientist responsible of the FlowCyTech core of the CEA\u2019s division of immuno-virology explains, \u201cOur research was held up in the slow lane because we had to collect the data, and then prepare and adapt the spread sheets. After that, we then devoted hours to creating visually appealing graphs and bar charts to show the results.\u201d Cosma stumbled upon Tableau by chance. \u201cI was following a research colleague on Twitter, and they happened to mention they were using Tableau to visualize their data,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe more I read about the solution, the more it became apparent that I was looking at the future of business intelligence and analytics. The results jump off the screen; there\u2019s no slow and time-consuming data gathering data gathering.\u201d Fueled by what he had seen, Cosma installed a trial of the Tableau technology. Within minutes he was supporting his flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting with visual reporting. The cytometry platform examines, counts, and sorts up to 50,000 fluorescence-tagged cells per second, and is used to separate cells of interest to the CEA research team. Using Tableau, the CEA team integrates the vast amount of research data collected by the flow cytometry into a single visual analysis process. This allows Cosma and his team to quickly see patterns in their data and shift views instantly to follow their line of research. \u201cTableau is transforming the way we look at and analyze our research data,\u201d he says. \u201cWe simply select the data we need and then anyone can instantly visualize the information in a multitude of different ways. We\u2019re used to asking for changes and then waiting several days for the adjusted report to be returned. Now it\u2019s all done on the fly.\u201d Cosma cites one example of how CEA is using Tableau to streamline and accelerate the research process. \u201cWe use Tableau to control the quality of the instruments and materials we use in the labs. For instance, when we need to access an antibody stored in the fridge, Tableau points us immediately to which antibody is the most appropriate for the test, its reference, and its history.\u201d For CEA the big change using Tableau is in getting more answers, not more questions. \u201cWe are dealing with huge volumes of data as part of our viral infection research. Tableau makes that volume of big data transparent. It answers questions immediately, combining data exploration and visualization in one easy-to-use application that anyone on the team can learn quickly,\u201d says Cosma. Anyone on the CEA team comfortable with Excel (and being scientists they are all comfortable!) can create interactive dashboards and share them securely across the organization. The team also has the flexibility to export high-resolution images. This means they can add the visualizations directly into published research reports. \u201cTableau saves the CEA\u2019s division of immune-virology days of work and is the equivalent of having one extra member of staff on the team,\u201d Cosma adds. \u201cOnly last week for example, we needed to identify several individuals who were participating in a research study. We have thousands of candidates on our lists, but we didn\u2019t spend hours trawling through spread sheet lists, the individuals were identified in seconds.\u201d"

In this English-language video, Dr. Lucie Salwiczek, Data Scientist, Urban Brand GmbH, discusses how she uses Tableau to increase the speed and flexibility of data analysis. There is also related content in German. Tableau: Can you tell us what a data scientist does for an e-commerce company?\nDr. Lucie Salwiczek, Data Scientist, Urban Brand GmbH: I analyze data, collecting data, blending them, providing them internally to other departments and externally to our website, to our customers. Tableau: What sort of data do you normally analyze?\nLucie: Our company focus is on young parents, pregnant women, and parents who have kids up to the age of four. We have more than 20,000 products that one can buy and we have approximately tens of thousands of customers who buy something, and millions of visitors. So we have quite a lot of data\u2014and some of the data are really time-sensitive. For example, we have deals. I have to make the decision \"Do I make a deal tomorrow again? Do I extend it? What was the customer response? Tableau: And how does Tableau fit into this scenario?\nLucie: You want to analyze the data now, and Tableau can help with this. You use the data warehouse and the real, live data. Real-time data is very important for us. In logistics, for example, we make the promise that if you order by 5 pm, you get the product the next day. We can't wait until the next day with a solution; the product has to get there. Or as another example, we work with Google Analytics, Google AdWords, to obtain the data. Then when we have a deal, for example, to be able to respond immediately with prices, depending on how we see our product performing with this price relationship. And then we need to respond right away\u2014within an hour, within a day, within two hours. But that needs to be monitored at all times. Tableau dashboards provide a lot of flexibility, so you can provide a nice background, and still focus on a single detail. And with a dashboard, it's possible to stay in the overview, or also expand one part and analyze it in more detail. Since data doesn't mean anything out of context, it's good that the context is really accessible. Tableau: That must help you make decision faster. Do you also use Tableau\u2019s visual analytics to help others understand your findings?\nLucie: Tableau allows me to create something that's visually impeccable and still present complex data in one place. So I can have the whole marketing department sitting in front of one screen, and we can drill down and talk about details or look at the big picture. I think it's a cool thing, and will really, really advance decision making\u2014making it quicker, making it more thorough. Tableau: Are there other ways that Tableau is helping you?\nLucie: Tableau is very helpful to the extent that I can tap into a large number of data sources that I wasn't able to link together before. Before Tableau, I had to get the data from everywhere and have it all in one place. Then I had to transform, compile or import it somehow so that I had it in a single system\u2014which was quite an arduous task. With Tableau, that's far, far easier. Now I can just combine the data together, merge, analyze and prepare it, check data quality, create reports, dashboards, and so on. It's really enjoyable to get data from everywhere and be able to analyze data visually, not just with numbers, but to have a combination of both. Tableau: Are you using Tableau to look at data in new ways?\nLucie: Tableau is giving us new ideas about where we need more data, where we need more analysis. While I was playing with Tableau to get to know it better, I discovered that I can do many things in parallel. I play with it, analyze the data and see, \u201cWow, here I have to improve my data quality.\u201d So I do both in parallel, so to speak. It's not separate anymore, in my mind. With Tableau, you already start analyzing. And by analyzing, you get two things: you get the result to a question, but you also look at your data and identify where you need some more data, where you need improvement. And you also get ideas to say (to people), \u201cHey, did you ever ask this question? Is this interesting for you? Maybe I have an idea, and maybe they say, \"I didn't know you could do it.\" So while you are playing with Tableau, you also create new ideas for new avenues that we haven't thought of yet. Tableau: Can you tell us your overall impression of Tableau? Lucie: What I think is so special about Tableau is that it's very easy to learn. It's simple to implement, so you don't waste any time. It's extremely flexible in the things that you can do\u2014whether you just want to make reports or delve deeper into the data, analyze it\u2014you have everything in one package. Tableau: What would you say to others considering Tableau?\nLucie: When I consider now if I would recommend Tableau to someone else, yes or no, I would say the thing is that it's very easy to learn. It's suitable for both small companies and large companies. So there's no problem with scalability, you can grow\u2026there's no need to be afraid of jumping in too quickly."

        "content": "Inspari\u2019s more than 50 business intelligence specialists offer focused, effective consulting services to customers across many industries. Inspari has offices located north of Copenhagen and in Aarhus, Denmark. In this video, Inspari's Sales and Marketing Director, Jens Jacob Aarup, and Managing Director, Thomas Black-Petersen, discuss how the consultancy is partnering with Tableau to better meet customer needs and to grow the business. Tableau: How has the partnership with Tableau impacted Inspari?\nJens Jacob Aarup, Sales and Marketing Director: Our Tableau business is doing great. I think it's because with Tableau you really have a product that the users like. They like to use it. Actually I'll say they love to use Tableau. And I think that's one of the reasons why our Tableau business is doing so well. Thomas Petersen-Black, Managing Director: We work with Tableau almost on a daily basis, and we have a very good dialogue with them, both from the salespeople and for myself. We share information, we share opportunities, and we help each other. Tableau has had a very good impact on our business; because our growth... it is in Denmark by far the fastest growing BI company. Tableau: That\u2019s great to hear! Have you gotten any specific feedback from your customers about Tableau?\nJens Jacob: What our customers are saying to us right now is \"thank you for delivering such a great product, this is really, really easy to use.\" They're saying that this is like doing Excel, but on speed.\nThomas: For most of our clients Tableau has been something new. They had never seen anything like it before. It's like having a very old mobile phone that no one can use and then getting something that is very easy to use that we can all do. Tableau is just so easy to work with and our clients sometimes don't even believe us until they get their hands on and they can work with it themselves. Tableau: How did Tableau come to your attention?\nThomas: It was actually one of my colleagues who sent me a link and said \"check this out.\" And I did check it out and it took me about 10 minutes to download it, try it, and built something I normally would have spent hours in building. So that was an easy way to get encouraged. Tableau: What new opportunities are you excited about?\nThomas: We can see that big data is coming and it's all around us. We have devices that are generating big data. And now we need to leverage that. The next big thing we are doing with Tableau is we will include much more data from what we traditionally have done with business intelligence solutions. So we're including Google data, Twitter data, Facebook data, and we're including sensor data that we just monitor and collect using Hadoop. Tableau: What other changes are you seeing?\nThomas: People are changing the way they're using analytics. It used to be reports and long lists and spreadsheets that were specified-\u201cLook exactly like this\u201d-and you would do the same report for years. But now it changed and we see that ideas come up very fast. Tableau: Why do you think people respond to the idea of using visual analytics to help them understand their data?\nJens Jacob: Dashboarding and the visual analytics, that's like the filter between the users that are supposed to change something in the business and the data and the value that's within it. So that's a key element to actually achieving something with your BI tool. Most of the time when we show business users\u2014and our customers\u2014visual analytics, the first thing they say is \u201cWow!\u201d Because they dreamt of doing stuff like this; and now they're actually able to do it with data discovery tools\u2014 and especially with Tableau."

        "content": "It is Norway\u2019s largest marketplace: an online service where millions of consumers and businesses come to buy and sell everything from bowling balls to BMWs, houses to hosepipes. To keep its finger on the pulse of who is buying and selling, what sells, and emerging trends, FINN.no relies on Tableau Software interactive, visual analytics. The best-in-class platform for business intelligence (BI) is helping FINN.no to understand more about its millions of customers, grow the user base, and increase revenues. Visual, real-time, self-service ad hoc and KPI reports are accelerating sales growth in FINN.no\u2019s mobile channel, and enabling the company to rapidly harness big data analytics. According to the Norwegian company, Tableau is also \u201cmiles quicker and easier than using Spotfire or QlikView.\u201d FINN.no is a recent convert to Tableau\u2019s revolutionary visual business analytics. Until recently, the company\u2019s 300 employees relied on a fragmented assortment of BI tools, including spreadsheets. The silo-based tools gave a narrow glimpse of intelligence into advertising sales, unique users, and other metrics, but couldn\u2019t provide a holistic view of the business. And reporting was principally an IT department affair: business users would request reports and wait sometimes days for the results to arrive. All of that changed with the formation of FINN.no\u2019s BI team, led by Anders Skoe, Director of Business Intelligence. \u201cOur goal was for FINN.no to be driven by reports, not by data,\u201d he says. \u201cWe identified three user needs. First, requirements for ad hoc reports on issues like web traffic on a particular advertisement, or advertising inventory. Second, the need for standard, drill-through reporting on KPIs. And third, self-service reporting for our customers, so they can see who viewed their advertisement.\u201d Skoe previously worked on business intelligence for Google\u2019s partnership team in the U.S., so when it came to choosing a BI solution, he had some demanding requirements. \u201cAnyone can use Tableau\u2019s browser-based analytics\u2014and that was backed up by the very positive reports from Gartner and other analysts. You don\u2019t need to be a programmer. We looked at Spotfire, QlikView, and other solutions, but by comparison they were almost incomprehensible! What we could do in half an hour with Tableau would have taken a day using Spotfire or QlikView.\u201d By standardizing on Tableau, timely, accurate, trusted data is now in everyone\u2019s grasp. FINN.no is using the best-in-class visual analytics in almost every corner of the business to understand more about its customers, grow the user base, and increase revenues. One of the key drives this year is to succeed in mobile channels. Tableau provides FINN.no\u2019s sales teams with near real-time insight into revenue from mobile channels as a percentage of total sales, with the results displayed on plasma screens around the Oslo headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s all about sharing data that was tied to one department. Thanks to Tableau\u2019s insight into mobile revenues, the entire culture of the company is leaning towards success in the mobile space,\u201d explains Skoe. Tableau dashboards are also integrated into FINN.no\u2019s Microsoft Dynamics CRM dashboards. When a sales person engages with a customer, Tableau provides an overview of where the customer sits in the brand hierarchy; answering questions like how much do they spend? What type of service plan are they on? And what is their purchase history? It\u2019s all quick, easy, and intuitive. \u201cIf we tried to incorporate that type of reporting into Microsoft Dynamics, it would have taken a team of consultants two weeks to complete. With Tableau, we can do it in a day,\u201d says Skoe. Real-time Tableau interactive dashboards are also keeping the SMB sales teams abreast of their sales performance. The team focuses on outbound calls, and by integrating Tableau with the data warehouse, they can view sales data broadcast on plasma screens with the data cycled every four minutes. This timely, relevant, and intuitive view of performance is making the team more competitive according to Skoe. \u201cThe SMB team is now doing more calls and pulling in more revenue thanks to Tableau.\u201d Tableau also enables FINN.no to harness the big data analytics prevalent in the organization. FINN.no receives more than 4.1 million unique users each month, who spend on average 17 minutes on the popular service. On a typical day, there might be 300,000 advertisements on the Norwegian site. Tableau visualizes this vast amount of unstructured data\u2014from the website, infrastructure logs and sensors, and eCommerce. This allows the staff to interpret this big data, identifying trends, acting on customer opportunities, and boosting revenues. For the first time, data is now in the hands of the users. The self-service approach to analytics means that BI bottlenecks are a thing of the past at FINN.no: the users have the tools they need to answer their own questions, simply by logging into a secure website from any browser. Tableau is popular with the users too. \u201cWe even use Tableau to track which teams use Tableau and how much they use the technology,\u201d says Skoe. \u201cThe FINN.no teams are very data-driven, for example, and we saw their use of Tableau increase from 50 percent to 90 percent in one month.\u201d"

Yota Networks specializes in the development and management of 4G infrastructure and provides access to its infrastructure for carriers on a mobile virtual network operator model. Yota Networks is owned by Skartel LLC. In this video, Yota Networks Project Manager Natalia Lyubimova shares how the telecommunications company is using Tableau to save time with on-the-go network analytics. Tableau: Would you tell me about your role at Yota? How do you interact with Tableau on a daily basis?\nNatalia Lyubimova, Project Manager: I'm a project manager and I work with projects related to Tableau: dashboard developments, dashboard implementations, training and so on. Tableau: What kind of data do you work with?\nNatalia: We mainly work with network statistics. It's an indicator for LTE networks: download networks, qualitative indicators, loading indicators, utilization, successful signaling procedures, processing complaints, breakdowns, work plans and that sort of thing. Tableau: And what kind of data sources are you connecting with?\nNatalia: We have several data sources. Vertica is our main source. It contains up to 80% of all data that we work with. And then there are other information systems too, like geographic information systems, HP service manager, 1C and others. Tableau: How has Yota\u2019s implementation of Tableau grown?\nNatalia: We started implementation of Tableau at our company Yota Networks with one project for network statistics. It should have been a big report on more than 30 regions which should have contained information from numerous pre-existing Excel reports. Today we have more than 10 Tableau projects and they contain not only network and network statistics data, but things like financial data, operating indicators and so on. Tableau: What kind of impact would you say Tableau has had on Yota Networks?\nNatalia: We completely changed the approach to the report development plan, use of reports, approaches to data analysis; we started to have people work with data, analytics and reports. That\u2019s to say it\u2019s not simply a picture that you look at, it\u2019s a picture that you look at and understand. And you can play with it. Tableau: Do you find that you\u2019re able to save time using Tableau?\nNatalia: The amount of time to develop reports has been reduced to a fraction. Before it was a process where we created technical specifications for reports and gave them to developers. Now we actually do it all online each week. That is, it can be done on the go for any idea of the user\u2014we do it right there. Tableau: That\u2019s great! Have you noticed any other changes that you attribute to Tableau?\nNatalia: What really changed was that people afterwards, as we started using some new reports\u2026 they started to become interested. That is, the reports weren\u2019t something completely different, needed only by the analysts. Everyone started to use it. The number of people who looked at it and analyzed network data increased. In my opinion the introduction of Tableau strongly changed the attitudes of people toward data, toward reports, and now everyone knows where to find data on the network. Where to go, where to look, and what to do. Tableau: Would you say that Yota has seen a strong ROI from its investments in Tableau?\nNatalia: In my opinion the introduction of Tableau paid for itself within the first weeks after we started using it. We don\u2019t do as many projects with outside partners, we don\u2019t pay for the development of reports, we do this with our own hands. Tableau: How would life be different if you didn\u2019t have Tableau?\nNatalia: If we didn\u2019t have Tableau, we would have continued to make huge reports in Excel, we wouldn\u2019t be as unique as we are now. Without Tableau, we wouldn\u2019t be such an innovative and truly dynamic and progressive company, which we actually are. Tableau: What was your first impression of Tableau?\nNatalia: I was the last of the company analysts who tried Tableau! I didn't believe that it was something other than an ordinary biosystem. I didn't want to write SQL and program and so on. And then everything happened\u2026 that I was doing everything myself in Tableau. Tableau: So we won your heart, finally! Anything else you\u2019d like to say?\nNatalia: Thank you, Tableau. Working with Tableau completely changed my work, my attitude towards work, things I do. I always liked working with data, now it\u2019s my main job and I love it\u2014a lot."

Information systems are at the heart of the organization, supporting the development and needs of the various services that comprise the French Red Cross. Some 43 people work in the humanitarian network\u2019s Department of Information Systems. They are joined by seven regional IT managers. The departmental budget is more than \u20ac8 million. \u201cThe last decade saw the development of information systems with a view to better management of the entire organization,\u201d says Laurent Monnet, Director of Information Systems for the French Red Cross. \u201cThe goal has been to harmonize and streamline our IT services, maximizing service effectiveness on the front line.\u201d The trouble was that the French Red Cross had no means of easily analysing or making sense of all the data arriving in the organization. Laurent Monnet continues, \u201cDuring the development of the infrastructure, we were focused on transactions and support. Now the emphasis has shifted to analysis of the data\u2014and that led to the launch of a new business intelligence architecture.\u201d The new model comprises a decision support system, data integration, and reporting.\n\u201cWe wanted an intuitive, user-friendly business intelligence tool for users; on that enables dynamic performance and results in real time,\u201d says Marie-Ange Tnani, Project Manager for Business Intelligence, French Red Cross. With support from Altic, a French systems integrator and specialist in open source-based business intelligence, the French Red Cross chose Tableau Software. \u201cTableau is capable of almost anything and is so easy to use, it gives our users autonomy,\u201d says Marie-Ange Tnani. \u201cAs specialists in their field, Altic also understood our needs and worked hand-in-hand with us to deliver a comprehensive, high performance business intelligence architecture.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long for the first results to arrive. In the space of just over eight weeks, the French Red Cross was live on a new data warehouse supporting sheltered accommodation for the elderly-EHPAD, or \u00c9tablissements d'H\u00e9bergement pour Personnes \u00c2g\u00e9es D\u00e9pendantes. The warehouse contains 43 indicators and six different data sources, including accounting, human resources, budget, business, treasury, and organization. \u201cWithin three weeks of introducing Tableau Software, the French Red Cross had created its first dashboard. From experience, it would have taken us six months to reach that goal,\u201d insists Mark Salli\u00e8res, founder of Altic. \u201cTableau plays a major role as an accelerator and catalyst for this business analytics. By visualizing intelligence, Tableau offers the French Red Cross agility, flexibility and faster access to answers about sheltered housing for the elderly.\u201d \u201cTableau gives our managers the up-to-the-minute indicators they need to manage their organization. Users can quickly discover and share data,\u201d explains Marie-Ange Tnani. \u201cThe tangible results are immediate: we are breaking down the silos of data and creating a common language around data. This leads to a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement in data quality, highlighting existing inconsistencies.\" Early results reinforce the fact that the Department of Information Systems made the right choice in Tableau. \u201cTableau offers a view across the organization, integrating indicators from different sources, and offering a straightforward, geographical representation of some of these indicators,\u201d says Marie-Ange Tnani. In due course, Information Systems French Red Cross will provide dashboards for its numerous offices, using the Tableau Reader functionality. \u201cThe return on investment we receive from Tableau justifies that strategy,\u201d Laurent Monnet concludes."

        "content": "Tableau: What kind of data do you work with at Visa Europe?\nSimon Gatenby, VP of Segmentation & Targeting, Visa Europe: Most of the stuff at Visa Europe is highly structured data\u2014we deal with payments information. In fact, it's about as structured as you will get. Very, very ordered, very, very structured. From that perspective, it is a very simple model, we have records of transactions. Tableau: Can you give us a sense of how your use of data has evolved at Visa Europe?\nSimon: We've gone a very linear path. We've built the warehouse, we've built the data governance around the warehouse, we've built the analytics layer. We've invested a lot of time in organizing and structuring our data and placing it in a warehouse and putting best-in-class analytics on top of that. The key now is about taking those analytics and that meaning and translating it into a story that we can play to our users, be they internal, you know, our internal stakeholders, or more importantly now as we try to realize the value of this data, to our external parties. Tableau: Can you tell us how the Visa Europe \u201cTableau story\u201d started?\nSimon: How did it start? It started with a rant from me that kind of the way we were presenting stuff was taking far too long. So long projects, long engagements and poor-quality deliverables. And I took a sort of almost unilateral decision, with the organization's support, to trial some things. So (we did) a three-month proof of concept about how we can go from data to visualization. Tableau: And what could you tell after three months? Was that long enough?\nSimon: With a 12-week implementation, we are able to deliver something quickly that is sharper and more engaging than anything we've been able to do in the past. And really what we have, then, is a rolling thunder in the organization of, \"I want some of that, please.\" So we've rolled out that way and we've just seen it organically grow in the organization as people want more and more. Tableau: That\u2019s great to hear! It sounds like you\u2019re expanding the footprint of Tableau at Visa Europe, then. How is that going?\nSimon: So because the deployment model is flexible, because the license costs aren't prohibitive, and because we can grow it organically, we don't have that big bit of decision point. And then we can scale this thing out in a very, very easy way. Tableau: Do you have any advice for people thinking about using Tableau?\nSimon: The kind of disciplines around good information management, around organizing your informational state, around dealing with all the data quality and data governance issues, around documentation, development life cycles don't go away. They stay and stay with you. And that's just good practice. But if you're a way down that journey and what you're struggling with is to engage people with your data and the value it liberates, Tableau is -- Tableau is the thing for you. Tableau: What kind of benefits would you say those customers\u2014the ones who are down that road\u2014 could expect from the decision to implement Tableau?\nSimon: Your speed to understanding and realizing the value will be great. And what you'll find at the end of it is that your product is just exciting to engage with. The days of boring graphs and lack of insight because you just can't see past the font is the wrong shape and the color's the wrong shade and everything doesn't line up...they should be gone. So you should get people concentrating on the real thing, which is the value and the insight that the data gives, because the presentation is so nice and agile and flexible and attractive."

        "content": "Medway Youth Trust is a registered charity serving vulnerable youth in the Medway area of England, approximately 35 miles southeast of London. At Medway Youth Trust, trained advisors provide advice and guidance to at-risk youth in the hopes of helping them to create brighter futures. MYT has pioneered the use of predictive analytics within the public sector; this work culminated in a Gartner Business Intelligence Excellence award for MYT in February 2012. In this video, Gary Seaman, Head of Business Analytics for MYT, discusses how MYT is using Tableau to help advisors identify at-risk youth and allocate resources. Tableau: What made Medway Youth Trust decide to try to Tableau?\nGary Seaman, Head of Business Analytics for MYT: I've always wanted to be able to visually show the output from the prediction. It's very difficult to explain prediction modeling to people who don't use data. So I wanted to show, you know, a clear visual way, particularly for key stakeholders Tableau: Where do you get the data that you use?\nGary: Most of the information comes from the schools' systems\u2014that gets uploaded once a year. We also have information that we need to pass onto the Department of Education on a monthly basis, the same as every local authority does. And we have things called action plans. Our advisors will talk to a young person during an interview and ask them about their potential career choices, what they'd like to do, when they leave statutory education into further education. So all that's documented and we use a lot of that as well. Tableau: So do you work with mostly structured data or unstructured data?\nGary: Both. Proportionately the structured data is about 20 percent. So it\u2019s about 80% unstructured data. We do specialize in text analytics. A lot of the unstructured information is just free text form notes that the advisor types up. It could be a young person would say that they're sofa surfing, which is a UK term for staying around at different friends' houses every night. And for me that immediately says they're at risk of becoming homeless. So we extract all the text from that, put it into a text category, and that's an identifier that we can actually use to see, \u201cthis young person is at particular risk of becoming homeless. \u201d So we can then deploy an advisor to help them. Essentially we extract sentiment from that: what do young people like to do? What do they think about? We use relationship and entity analytics within that as well\u2014so who are their peers, who are they talking to. All kinds of really, really useful information that we've now been able to use in Tableau as well. Tableau: It sounds like you can get a pretty clear view of the young people that you help.\nGary: The clever thing that we're able to do is to join up all other data sources within our modeling software and within Tableau. We can connect data sources from schools' management system, from college systems, which is individual learner record information. So we're able to kind of map the path of a young person from year seven when they're 12, 13 years of age, all the way through to maybe 19, 20. We are trying to get higher education data so we can map a young person's education throughout their whole life. Tableau: How does Tableau fit into to your process?\nGary: So from start to finish an advisor would type in the notes, it would be extracted, and then we'd put it through the modeling process. And the output from that, we're able to put into a Tableau dashboard where we can visually see their risk of becoming unemployed\u2014we have a propensity score. And local authority advisors can see exactly who they need to target. Tableau: You mentioned that it was difficult to explain prediction modeling to non-data people? How has that changed with Tableau? Gary: It's been a difficult road for non-data people to understand that we're using data in such a powerful, insightful way. The beauty of Tableau is that it's so visual that they can actually have ownership of that data. Because we have a caseload management system they're actually feeling quite protective now of young people that they look after, and it's\u2014it's almost kind of created a competition within advisors and, you know, \"I'm going to make sure I get this young person onto an apprenticeship, and I'm going to work really hard to support them.\" Tableau: What were you using before you had Tableau?\nGary: Excel was our choice of software before Tableau. The output from the modeling process is a CSV file that we could filter and play around with bar graphs and charts and stuff. Tableau: How is Tableau helping Medway Youth Trust succeed in its goals?\nGary: It enables us to look at who needs our help the most\u2014and when and where. In the past, when we were to write a 40-page report with static bar graphs, some people would just look at it and think, \u201ca bit of bedtime reading.\u201d But now they can slice and dice the data however way they want, in terms of bespoke dashboards. For us as a charity to bid for other funding opportunities it's much easier to show somebody the impact that the modeling has and the impact in terms of our data. And I think people actually look at it and think to themselves, \u2018Wow, I didn't know that!\u2019 And they then start to ask further questions. Tableau: How do you see yourself using Tableau in the future?\nGary: When I look to the future I look at predicting modeling in terms of migration of young people in particular areas within our local authority district, and I think Tableau will be a great tool to visually see historically where young people in terms of their unemployment and their vulnerabilities have been, and going forward where they're likely to occur in the future, so we can have quite a bit of an influence with the local authority in suggesting possible areas for funding in the future."

        "company": "Swedish Medical Center",
        "content": "Swedish Medical Center (Swedish) needed to understand and communicate physician and hospital performance across a number of areas\u2014but traditional reporting solutions were cumbersome to implement and expensive to maintain. After implementing Tableau as its primary enterprise-wide analytics platform, the healthcare provider is driving improvements in quality care, improving patient experiences, and enjoying substantial savings through process improvements and improved efficiencies. Understanding, sharing and, ultimately, improving performance measures is always the focus for Swedish. This ongoing effort has become an even higher priority as healthcare moves away from traditional \u201cfee-for-service\u201d models and transitions aggressively to value-based reimbursement models. Under these new models, organizations will face reduced payments if they miss targets for factors such as readmission rates, patient satisfaction and other performance measures. Swedish tracks and communicates an array of performance metrics , but it needed to find a way to do so more effectively and less expensively\u2014and to tie those efforts to driving organization-wide performance improvement. For example, historically Swedish tracked readmission rates, but the work was time consuming and resource-intensive, leading to substantial lag times between patient care and reporting. \u201cDifferent groups in the organization were using spreadsheets to gather and organize readmissions data, and it was very time consuming for analysts and managers. Collecting all the data and trying to get good reports took time away from more valuable tasks. Everyone from the CEO to the managers thought there was a better way to solve this problem,\u201d says David Delafield, CFO of Swedish Medical Group, a division of the Swedish organization. While Swedish sends patient experience surveys to more than 15 percent of its patients each year, the organization lacked a simple, centralized way to share the results with internal staff and physicians. \u201cWe would get tens of thousands of survey responses,\u201d Delafield says. \u201cWe shared the results, but it was very inconsistent. Everyone was looking at different things, and some didn\u2019t look at the results at all.\u201d As a result, it was difficult for Swedish providers and administrators to consistently move in the same direction on patient experience metrics. In addition to preparing for value-based reimbursement, Swedish wanted to improve other areas like operating room efficiency, physician engagement and financial performance. Delafield, who has a finance and technology background, led a team tasked with selecting and implementing a platform to help Swedish understand and share performance metrics in order to drive improvements. \u201cThe lack of actionable data was a big issue,\u201d says Delafield. \u201cWe had no line-of-sight, visual way to look at things that were very important to the organization.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard if you have one technology platform for revenue data, another for quality, another for patient experience\u2014and people can\u2019t go to one spot for everything they need,\u201d Delafield says. \u201cIt makes it really difficult to align.\u201d This fractured approach created a growing need for expensive analyst support. \u201cThere were just too many random, custom reports which made it really difficult to coordinate efforts on key levers. Keeping overhead costs down is important so we wanted to find a relatively inexpensive but effective way to made data actionable for operators and physicians,\u201d says Delafield. \u201cWith so much custom reporting\u2014the overhead cost would expand indefinitely if we didn't get control of it.\u201d \u201cOur analysts would fulfill a lot of ad hoc requests, which are all pretty similar but for different audiences,\u201d Delafield says. \u201cAnd they were doing it over and over again, which became very expensive and made it very difficult to get a line of sight to what was happening across the company.\u201d By late 2012, Swedish was looking at a few potential options to meet its short- and medium-term requirements: IBM, SAP and Tableau. \u201cWe were very familiar with IBM and SAP; we knew what they could do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we also knew some of the issues that they couldn\u2019t address. And we wanted our solution to be accessible and effective for everyone in the organization, not just analysts.\u201d The Swedish analytics team experimented with building smaller views in Tableau 7, the most current version available at the time. \u201cWe had done enough to know that we could build this integrated platform using Tableau,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want this solution to be a niche visual tool for analysts; we wanted Tableau to be the solution for the company.\u201d Swedish began with a limited number of visualizations supported by a small team of analysts. \u201cIt took them very little time to get up to speed on Tableau,\u201d says Delafield. The initial dashboards debuted to a small audience\u2014but demand quickly outpaced expansion plans. \u201cIt was very organic and viral. We had a lot of emails each week from people wanting to get access,\u201d says Delafield. \u201cNow we\u2019re to the point where we\u2019re bringing a lot of new users onto the platform each week and we know it\u2019s having a big impact around alignment and simplification. Our focus now will be on expanding views and answering new business questions. Physicians will drive a lot of the movement towards value based healthcare so the Swedish team is working really hard to engage physicians wherever possible\u201d The current team comprises three technical resources and three fulltime report developers. \u201cIt's not a very large team to build what Swedish has created. It's been a significant value\u2014a great ROI and will allow us to retire most of the other reporting solutions across Swedish,\u201d Delafield says. Now that Swedish Medical Center is quickly moving towards using Tableau as its primary enterprise-wide performance analysis and reporting platform, everyone is looking at a \u201csingle version of the truth.\u201d \u201cI think this simplification, at low cost, is going to be a really important foundation for Swedish to meet strategic goals. Everyone\u2014operating room surgeons, medical directors, hospital administrators\u2014over time will funnel to this same spot, across the hospitals and the medical group,\u201d says Delafield. \u201cEveryone involved has done a great job.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re just starting this process but we\u2019re seeing a lot of improvement in many of these areas by making data simple and easily accessible for operators and physicians. It has been a company-wide effort,\u201d says Delafield. Employees now have a clearer understanding of the metrics on which they are evaluated as well as the ability to compare their performance levels with those of their peers, both within the organization and even across the state and the nation. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make most key levers in the organization completely objective so Swedish can accurately measure performance and have a certain amount of accountability, ,\u201d says Delafield. \u201cWhere possible we want decisions to be very data-driven.\u201d \u201cWe can see readmissions for the entire Swedish system,\u201d says Delafield. \u201cThe Swedish readmissions dashboard is built to be automated and match national definitions. The team that works on readmissions can focus on moving the rate down and not on collecting data.\u201d Employees can also see patient experience survey results in Tableau, helping them to understand how they are perceived by patients. \u201cWe have taken 35,000 survey results, and put them in one spot,\u201d Delafield says. \u201cThe providers can see what patients are saying about them specifically, or about their clinic, in addition to how they rank against their peers internally and externally.\u201d \u201cCombining this platform with operational teams has allowed Swedish to see significant movement on patient experience. These simple, consistent views tie into operations and help to drive change,\u201d he says. Swedish has been able to freeze analyst hiring as well, converting several existing analysts into Tableau power users to build the views used on Vantage. \u201cWe were able to stop the expansion of hiring more and more report writers to build every possible report that you can build.\u201d Delafield estimates that once fully implemented this will save Swedish approximately $750,000 each year. And the analysts are happier working in Tableau, too. \u201cOh, they love it. Solving key business problems and working with end users on what a visual interaction might look like? It's a gratifying place to be.\u201d He also says that the analysts appreciate that once a visualization is finished, it can be refreshed automatically as the data updates. \u201cOnce you do it once and automate it, it's done. You never have to do it again for the company, and everyone is looking at that one thing,\u201d Delafield says. Swedish has seen a great deal of value from the insight is has gained from its Tableau implementation. \u201cOverall, Tableau has helped us capture efficiencies and process improvements that we estimate to be valued at tens of millions of dollars,\u201d says Delafield. Both the Swedish organization and the analytics group have gained positive exposure from their successful use of Tableau. \u201cThis implementation has helped us put a strong foundation in place to move in the direction we need to move,\u201d says Delafield. \u201cIt has really helped the whole company catch up in the reporting and analytics space.\u201d Overall, Delafield sees Tableau as part of the Swedish journey towards business transformation and, ultimately, more efficiently serving the needs of the patients and communities it serves. \u201cJust about everyone in healthcare has or is going to have an Electronic Medical Record. We\u2019re trying to take the next step, which is working on using data to understand our performance and using that understanding to drive movement toward achieving our strategic goals. Eventually, we hope this platform will help us improve not only our internal performance but potentially change the way that we interact with our customers, the patients,\u201d he says. \u201cTableau has helped to improve our operations. And we're a good-sized system, so it's pretty exciting.\u201d"

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Gaming revenues growing four-fold in five years. Terabytes of big gaming data harnessed for agile and effective real-time decision making. And visual analytics delivered in minutes, compared to weeks sometimes using the previous business intelligence (BI) solution. These are just some of the highlights of IsCool\u2019s use of the Tableau Software real-time visualization analytics solution. By understanding more about gamers\u2019 preferences, behaviour, and needs, this leading European social gaming provider is increasing the size and number of its global gaming communities at a remarkably low cost of ownership. IsCool Entertainment is a European leader in social gaming, bringing together 2.8 million users on Facebook and other media with interactive games like IsCool, Stars Connect, and Temple Of Mahjong. A catalyst for the company\u2019s success is a laser-like focus on BI: a rigorous approach to analysing customer profiles, user adoption, and gaming use. Three years ago, when IsCool had 400,000 users and revenues of $3 million, the Paris-based company relied on a basic approach to data integration and BI for decision-making: open source integration tools and commercial BI visualization software. Today however, with 18 million user-generated actions occurring every day and revenues four times higher than in 2009, the focus is on agile big data analytics. \u201cGaming data is growing exponentially and it\u2019s moving in real-time,\u201d explains Ga\u00eblle Periat, digital analyst at IsCool. \u201cWe collect data from application logs, Facebook insights, and analytics tags. It is imperative that this data is in the hands of the business decision makers immediately, so they can make timely offers to gamers, make decisions about game development, and steer advertising programs for maximum impact.\u201d IsCool also needed a flexible approach to the way data was visualized and presented. Game designers, for instance, wanted visual, easy to understand graphics so they could tie new features onto existing popular ones. Programmers were more comfortable looking at reports from the technical log files. Senior IsCool business executives meanwhile wanted at-a-glance view of revenue forecasts, pipeline, and advertising spend. Until recently, IsCool relied on a QlikView tool. According to Ga\u00eblle Periat, the closed nature of the technology meant a data analyst was always on stand-by to help with the data integration. \u201cEvery time a director asked for a report, we needed to do some scripting which inevitably delayed the findings,\u201d she says. In response, IsCool has standardized on a Tableau real-time visualization analytics solution. The best-in-class solution for collaborative, rewarding, and effective BI is used by 20 staff throughout the company to accelerate timely, trusted decision making. IsCool can report immediately on the number of users for its games (traffic), which features are most commonly used, how long people play for, which downloads are most popular, and more. Harnessing big data, the team can also examine the correlation between the size of a gaming community and their level of engagement. Once a community is identified (either a small two-player, mid-size, or very large community), the team can engage that community more effectively, nurture it, and grow it to critical mass. Specific games come under the reporting microscope too. Tableau helps answer questions like, does a game have too many features? Which features are used by which users? And how to optimize feature access. Moreover, IsCool can now quickly and confidently establish different classes of users with different engagement profile and the use of features. Understanding more about how users interact with an IsCool game has led to a 23 percent incremental increase in engagement for certain targeted user classes. Simultaneously, authorized IsCool executives receive a daily report on crucial sales intelligence, including the previous day\u2019s revenues by item category, the number of concurrent users during the day, and the number of active players. \u201cWhile it took up to one week to prepare the reports in QlikView, we can now build and share new ideas in a few minutes with Tableau.\u201d Ga\u00eblle Periat was smitten from the start. \u201cWhen I first joined IsCool, the team said \u2018this is Tableau, it is going to be your best friend\u2019. At the time, I didn\u2019t believe them. Within minutes though, I was productive; developing new real-time reports and revealing results about the gaming experience we had never been able to reach before.\u201d By transforming IsCool into an agile, data-driven gaming organization, Tableau has helped IsCool grow revenues four-fold in five years. \u201cTableau has enabled IsCool to take control of big data and has made decision making faster, easier, and more effective. I doubt IsCool could have grown from $3 million revenues in 2009 to $13.2 million today without the interactive visualization of data that Tableau provides,\u201d says Ga\u00eblle Periat. Another crucial component in this success has been the innovative Actian Vectorwise analytic database. Replacing an open source platform, Vectorwise provides IsCool with lightning-fast and cost-effective database and BI performance. The solution resides on virtual servers for ultra-efficient, big data processing, and currently stores up to one terabyte of gaming data. Vectorwise enables Ga\u00eblle Periat and her colleagues to analyze more data than ever before\u2014and at a fraction of the cost of traditional data processing. She comments, \u201cUsing Vectorwise, IsCool is able to process and exploit vast amounts of big data on much smaller machines. This has enabled the company to save more than $10,000 annually in hardware costs alone. For a small, dynamic company like IsCool, this is a significant saving. For Ga\u00eblle Periat, there is only one way to sum up the value of Tableau. \u201cAt IsCool, we think Tableau is very cool,\u201d she says."

        "content": "Cars.com, a division of Classified Ventures, receives more than 11 million visits each month as the leading destination for online car shoppers. It offers credible and easy-to-understand information from consumers and experts to help buyers formulate opinions on what to buy, where to buy and how much to pay for a car. Cars.com wanted to provide its salespeople with easy-to-access information about how their customers\u2019 ads performed on the site. The company also wanted the ability to share similar information directly with its advertisers and with internal business users. With the help of Tableau Professional Services, Cars.com has enabled at-a-click access to Tableau dashboards from within Salesforce and the ability to publish dashboards to the company\u2019s customer portal. As one of the most popular online car shopping destinations, Cars.com depends on gathering and analyzing consumer behavior on its site to improve experiences for its visitors. It uses the same approach to help the site\u2019s paying advertisers\u2014primarily car dealers and automotive manufacturers\u2014improve their results. The company\u2019s data warehouse and business intelligence team gathers and interprets site visitor data from the 11 million monthly visitors. Based on traffic volume, there is a significant amount of data stored in its 12-terabyte Teradata warehouse appliance. \u201cAmong other things, we track impressions, conversions and other key activities a consumer can take on our site that indicate engagement with an auto brand or to a dealership,\u201d says Kevin Wyderka, Director of Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence for Cars.com. Wyderka knew that visualization would help several audiences make better use of this data. \u201cIn the past, a lot of what the business analysts and power users within Cars.com did was pull data from various places into Excel. They did pretty much everything in Excel,\u201d says Wyderka. It was clear that dashboards would save these internal users a great deal of time. Wyderka also wanted to publish dashboards outside of the Cars.com firewall for two very different audiences: advertisers and Cars.com salespeople. \u201cWe wanted to be able to publish in the customer portal that we created for our advertisers,\u201d says Wyderka. \u201cWe also want to be able to publish those same dashboards to Salesforce, because most of our sales reps work strictly within that solution.\u201d In fact, Cars.com best practices require that the more than 600-person sales team be able to do all of its work from within the cloud-based Salesforce solution. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our salespeople logging into multiple systems to find what they need. They should be spending all of their time consulting with their customers, not logging into systems to find information,\u201d Wyderka explains. During a call, a Cars.com sales person must be able to tell customers what ad products they\u2019ve purchased, how their ads are performing, and offer tips on how to improve performance. \u201cIn order to make information available to our sales and customer support folks who live in the Salesforce ecosystem, we were pushing lots and lots of data from our data warehouse up into the Salesforce cloud,\u201d says Wyderka. This process took up to three hours. \u201cUsually the warehouse was loaded by 8:00 a.m. central time, which is already 9:00 on the eastern time zone. Then, if we had to package up the data and further ship it up into Salesforce to make it available to the sales team, it could be 10:00, 11:00, or noon eastern time before users have access to the information,\u201d says Wyderka. At times, there would be delays loading the warehouse, which slowed access to current data even further. \u201cFrom a business perspective, the sales rep at the close of previous day was pulling essentially all of the information that they needed for their morning appointments because they knew that data wouldn't be refreshed in time,\u201d says Wyderka. One of the busiest times for Cars.com and its customers is the month of February, so it is also a very busy time for the data warehouse and business intelligence team. \u201cOne of our big advertising events is the Super Bowl. We\u2019ve advertised in the Super Bowl for the past six years\u2014and many of our national auto manufacturers advertiser customers also advertise on the Super Bowl,\u201d says Wyderka. \u201cSo the month of February tends to be a fairly intense time of the year when people are online shopping for vehicles.\u201d Wyderka\u2019s team runs reports for these auto manufacturers throughout February. This manual process has been time-intensive. \u201cIt was a manual feed of pulling data from a couple of places, mashing it up in Excel and sending it out,\u201d says Wyderka. \u201cThis took a couple of hours each day. So the report generally got to the customer by about noon their time out on the West Coast,\u201d says Wyderka. Wyderka went looking for a data visualization and dashboarding tool that would help him improve efficiencies and complement the existing reporting platform. \u201cWe are an SAP Business Objects shop from a reporting perspective. I wanted a tool that would augment what we have and also position us well for doing some data exploration. \u201d he says. He turned to a consulting organization, the Chicago Business Intelligence Group, for help in narrowing the search. \u201cThey did some investigation, and came back with a nice summary of all the different tools, where they fit in the marketplace, and what Gartner and others were saying about them,\u201d says Wyderka. \u201cWhen they gave us their shortlist\u2014Tableau was on top.\u201d Wyderka arranged for a Tableau proof of concept (POC). \u201cQuite frankly, you sold my business users right out of the gate,\u201d says Wyderka. \u201cAnd I had someone on my staff that came up to speed very quickly and said, \u2018This is great\u2014I know I can help our user community adopt it.\u2019 So we pretty quickly landed on Tableau.\u201d Wyderka found his data visualization answer. But now how to architect the Cars.com solution so it could meet the need of publishing dashboards to two very different audiences? With the help of the Tableau sales representative, Cars.com determined that it needed two instances of Tableau Server: one \u201cstandard\u201d deployment for within the Cars.com firewall and one external-facing instance that would publish to external channels. Wyderka remembers having a lot of questions about how his team would make that work. \u201cWhat do we do when we have a dashboard that should be available both inside and outside the firewall? How do we make sure we've got that in sync?\u201d Wyderka decided to bring in Tableau Professional Services for consulting help. \u201cThe Professional Services consultants gave us best practices and some perspective on what they\u2019ve seen at other clients,\u201d says Wyderka. \u201cWe saved a lot of time by not having to \u2018scrap and rework.\u2019 We were able to lay everything out in sessions with the on-site Professional Services consultant. We talked through pros and cons and we were able to get up and running quickly.\u201d He points out that the more standard deployment within the firewall was simple to accomplish. \u201cGetting the internal server set up with Active Directory authentication was easy,\u201d says Wyderka. \u201cWhere the Tableau consultants really helped us was solving for the piece where we wanted to better integrate with delivery channels, like Salesforce, outside of the firewall.\u201d Tableau Professional Services consultants worked closely with both Cars.com data warehousing architects and the Salesforce CRM team to establish token authentication between Salesforce and the external-facing Tableau Server. The consultants also helped Wyderka\u2019s team understand how to manage and maintain the two environments from the standpoint of migrating new dashboards through the Cars.com environment, from set-up to maintenance and managing security access. \u201cI'm not sure how feasible it would have been without the help of the Professional Services team. At least, it would have taken us a long time to figure out how the different security and authentication options should work,\u201d says Wyderka. Because Cars.com did not try to architect and deploy on their own, Wyderka cannot say exactly how long it would have taken\u2014but he estimates that they saved up to 80 hours of employee time. Cars.com currently has 45 employees authoring Tableau dashboards that are widely-used throughout the enterprise. \u201cThere are more than 600 sales reps using at least one dashboard. And then there are other parts of the organization that use the tool for data exploration,\u201d Wyderka explains. In order to get started, many of the Cars.com team members authoring visualizations explored online training at tableausoftware.com. Several also attended in-person training events held in Chicago. Wyderka is planning to bring in Tableau classroom trainers for some on-site training, when his team\u2019s schedules permit. This past February, the Cars.com team created a Tableau dashboard for an OEM customer that purchased ad space on the homepage. Wyderka\u2019s team spent approximately four hours to create the visualization. \u201cOnce we had the dashboard the way we wanted it, there was no manual intervention to refresh it. We were done. And the customer could log in every day and look at the refreshed dashboard to track how effective their advertising seemed to be on our site.\u201d Compared with the previous, manual method, Wyderka says that his team saved 45 hours in the month of February. Wyderka and his team appreciate that the color palette and design flexibility within Tableau that enable visualizations to match the Cars.com branding. \u201cWe are a commercial, public website and obviously, there are design standards that the site adheres to. We were able to replicate some of those design standards in terms of color and font and things like that within Tableau,\u201d says Wyderka. \u201cThe dashboards just look like they belong to Cars.com as a brand.\u201d That was an important consideration for these customer-facing reports, and is something that Wyderka says will continue to be valuable when the team takes the next step of publishing visualizations directly to the customer portal. This automated reporting is useful well beyond February\u2019s busy season. \u201cI can refresh the warehouse, and the dashboards are immediately refreshed,\u201d says Wyderka. He points out that the new process is far more beneficial for the sales team. \u201cAt 9:00 a.m., as the sales reps are starting their day, they can pull fresh information on their customers and they're ready to go, whereas before it may not have been available until the afternoon.\u201d Wyderka\u2019s contact on the sales operations side has shared that the sales team\u2019s reactions to the new dashboards have been very positive. \u201cThey like the way it looks and how they can interpret the information. And it\u2019s easy for them to get to and use,\u201d says Wyderka. \u201cThey were very excited with what we were able to accomplish.\u201d To see this story in printer-friendly format, please download the .pdf."

And if the resulting document answered the wrong question\u2014or users developed new questions after seeing the results? \u201cThey would have to go back to IT and request another report and wait, look at it, and go back to IT for another report and then wait again,\u201d says Sarah Nell, Global Corporate Account Analyst at ManpowerGroup. \u201cUpdating these reports took a lot of time,\u201d adds Nell. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just have them automatically update.\u201d Some teams tried to avoid the IT queue by creating their own business review documents from varying sources. \u201cWe had a lot of one-off solutions that worked for that Band-Aid moment,\u201d Nell says. This approach produced its own issues\u2014the answers to a question could change depending upon who you asked. And these homegrown solutions carried the risk of errors. \u201cWe had people using data incorrectly and they were creating different spreadsheet solutions surrounding that data and then providing that in reporting format,\u201d says Nell. ManpowerGroup has offices in more than 80 locations across the globe. While North American data is housed in a data warehouse, data from other locations could be provided in a number of different formats. \u201cEach of our global areas has its own business intelligence repositories, whether Excel or Access or something else,\u201d says Raviwongse. \u201cIf we want to get insight into a global client, we would go to our data warehouse for North American data and then try to blend that with whatever received from our other locations,\u201d says Raviwongse. In addition, some presentations required the team to blend data from external sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Federal Reserve to provide a holistic view of a particular industry. Blending information from these sorts of disparate data sources into a cohesive customer presentation was a long, manual process. \u201cIt was a lot of cutting and pasting,\u201d says Raviwongse. \u201cA lot of Excel work and a lot of Access work.\u201d Raviwongse estimates that a single business review report for a large client would take a team of five people approximately three weeks to produce. In 2010, two events occurred that would change how ManpowerGroup viewed and used data: the company established an analytics team, and it acquired TAPFIN, a human resources managed services provider. The newly-established corporate analytics team wanted to align its efforts with TAPFIN\u2019s analytics\u2014which was produced and distributed through Tableau Server. A few, scattered people within ManpowerGroup were already using Tableau Desktop for client insight; the TAPFIN acquisition brought additional attention to Tableau, and usage began to mushroom. \u201cWe wanted more flexibility in terms of the graphs and visualizations that we use. We wanted to be able to be independent from IT. And we wanted to be able to do the analysis and drill-through and have hierarchies pre-set based on the data,\u201d says Raviwongse. \u201cTableau met those needs, which was a big contributor to why we started to expand (our use).\u201d \u201cWe only have about six people in the analytics group, but we support all of Manpower,\u201d says Nell. \u201cDemand is really high. We really needed a solution that would the needs for faster deliverables, ad hoc report requests\u2014and we needed to make it sustainable.\u201d The analytics team began to provide Tableau visualizations for use in business reviews with clients. \u201cThat's when Tableau started picking up a lot of popularity,\u201d says Nell. \u201cThe teams saw our speed and thought, \u2018Oh wow\u2014we like you. Let's use you more.\u2019 The visuals and the different drill-downs that we could provide\u2014it was just leaps and bounds above what they were getting before,\u201d she says. Today, more than 20 people are authoring reports in Tableau and up to hundred are seeing and interacting with completed visualizations. The team is primarily self-taught, through videos from tableausoftware.com and power users training newer users. ManpowerGroup recently participated in its first Tableau Training on-site. The analytics team usually works with data extracts for increased speed and performance, but occasionally will connect to larger data sources. \u201cI just recently connected to a data source with all of our client data in it, and I\u2019d estimate that has more than 100 million rows,\u201d says Nell. TAPFIN continues publish its own analysis through Tableau Server, while the ManpowerGroup analytics group has been using Tableau Desktop. The team has just started experimenting with the hosted version of Tableau Server, Tableau Cloud. \u201cWe want to be able to provide access to visualizations to people\u2019s mobile devices, and we want to unplug from having to manage the infrastructure,\u201d says Raviwongse of the choice to move to Tableau Cloud. \u201cToday we can take five or six different reports and blend them into a single business review document. And if they don\u2019t blend the way we need them to, we can just connect to another data source through Tableau,\u201d says Nell. \u201cIt\u2019s seamless in the presentation and the connection time is much less than it was previously.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re easily pulling in data from external sources and putting it into client-facing visualizations,\u201d says Raviwongse. And while the global offices of ManpowerGroup are not yet sharing data the way Raviwongse envisions, he is able to use Tableau to work with what he can get. \u201cWe can just call different branches around the world and have them send data and we stitch it together using Tableau.\u201d This is far easier and faster than the previous process. The analytics team has made great strides in eliminating ad hoc reporting and standardizing within the company. \u201cWe took all of these different client reports that were utilized by different teams and brought them into analytics so we could create the solution through Tableau,\u201d says Nell. Now teams turn to the analytics department for their reporting needs, and they receive consistent answers based on standardized and validated data. Internal adoption of the Tableau reports is higher than for previous reporting, a change Raviwongse attributes to the ease and value the Tableau reports offer. Nell agrees, saying \u201cOther departments see what we can do with Tableau and they think, \u2018Oh, how can this impact what we're doing as well?\u2019 Those one-off solutions, those Band-Aids, they don\u2019t exist nearly as frequently anymore.\u201d Even with this increased demand, the analytics department is delivering better insight, faster than before. \u201cFive people and three weeks for one client was yesterday\u2019s reality. Now with Tableau, it is two people, fifty clients, in a day or two,\u201d says Raviwongse. Nell appreciates that Tableau enables her to automatically update visualizations by simply refreshing her connections at the data source. No re-work is required as long as the data formatting remains the same. \u201cIf I needed to update business review documents with Excel just two years ago, the time it would have taken me to do something like that is just astronomically different today,\u201d says Nell. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete night and day change.\u201d \u201cNow with Tableau, if we receive a request for a client review, I could have it to them before the end of business,\u201d says Nell. \u201cWe can respond with a level of immediacy and urgency that was not possible previously.\u201d Nell points out that it isn\u2019t just the analytics team\u2019s opinion that quality has improved. \u201cI had a conversation with one of our client teams last week and they were just astounded at what we're able to provide them now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe're providing greater insight into what is going on behind the scenes. So the client teams are getting better quality for even less effort than what we did before.\u201d Anecdotal or instinct-based decision-making is no longer the norm. \u201cNow we're actually seeing what is driving a client right now,\u201d says Nell. \u201cThese conversations have evolved over the last few years due to how we're using Tableau\u2014they never would have existed before. We're having strategic conversations now instead of story time.\u201d This access to timely, accurate information has increased accountability among customer teams. \u201cData\u2014or lack of it\u2014is no longer an excuse,\u201d says Raviwongse. \u201cWe have the data. And we can crunch it quickly, look at it and move on.\u201d \u201cCustomer teams are more cognizant of how the program is running overall,\u201d says Nell. \u201cThey're trying to be more efficient in how they manage placement and how people are going into their assignments.\u201d For example, client teams have started requesting Tableau analysis of placement turnover to get a better sense of the reason behind assignments that end. Teams can see visualizations of the various entry codes for assignment closure by specific time period, geography, and other data dimensions. \u201cThis enables us to get ahead of the talent needs of our clients,\u201d Raviwongse says, a change which has led to distinct benefits for ManpowerGroup as an organization. \u201cWe've become a lot less transactional. Today we are lot more strategic for our key customers,\u201d says Raviwongse. \u201cWe are more of a partner to our clients around the workforce and not just having \u2018I need a temp tomorrow\u2019 kind of conversations.\u201d For example, ManpowerGroup has worked with a consumer products company for 20 years. Over that time, the conversations were typically about the speed and quantity of ManpowerGroup\u2019s temporary worker placement. \u201cUsing Tableau, we were able to talk about how efficient it would be to blend multiple production lines and multiple warehouses\u2014a sort of workforce leveling plan across factories,\u201d says Raviwongse. \u201cThis could help this key customer obtain close to $100,000 in cost savings. We were able to uncover this because with Tableau we could regularly see and understand the different demand levels across different factories.\u201d The ManpowerGroup analytics team has begun piloting analytics as a service. \u201cWe are using Tableau as a platform to offer internal analysis to a hospital client, for example. They are in the Access-Excel world and were struggling with how to blend the data,\u201d says Raviwongse. \u201cI said, \u2018Hey, we can use Tableau to blend some of that data, visualize it, and match it up to what we have in our internal databases to give you a sense of how far off or on you are and how difficult it is to hire certain roles, and so on.\u201d ManpowerGroup is also testing Tableau for forecasting its own performance. The team has started to compare its regular IBM SPSS forecasting results with forecasts using the same measures within Tableau. \u201cWe have found that there is some variation, but it\u2019s very close,\u201d says Nell. \u201cSo we feel that it is viable and that we can work with it. Now we just need to build it out and make it more robust.\u201d In the future, the team is thinking about embedding visualizations into the company-wide SharePoint site. ManpowerGroup has recently begun using salesforce.com company-wide, so that analytics team also has begun experimenting with the salesforce.com direct connector that became available in Tableau 8."

        "content": "Interactions Marketing offers creative and effective in-store and outdoor experiences to leading retailers and consumer brands. The company also provides data-driven insights that help its customers understand how shoppers make purchasing decisions. In this video, Abhi Beniwal, Senior Vice President of Global Information Technology, and Giovanni DeMeo, Vice President of Global Marketing and Analytics, discuss how they are using Tableau Cloud to help customers see and understand their data, including data from Google BigQuery. Tableau: Interactions Marketing has been a Tableau customer for years now. How has your company benefitted from using Tableau? Giovanni DeMeo, Vice President of Global Marketing and Analytics: From my perspective Tableau is one of the greatest resources we have for being able to visualize the information for our end users and be able to identify quickly where the value is and translate that for retailers and manufacturers. Abhi Beniwal, Senior Vice President of Global Information Technology: Tableau really helped change the way we looked at data. We have moved from the boring reports\u2014columns and rows and very simple charts and graphs. We really set a different standard for our own internal businesses, as well as our customers. Giovanni: The biggest changes have been in how quickly we can analyze data, and how visually appealing we can make it with Tableau. Tableau: What prompted the move to Tableau Cloud? Abhi: In the last couple of years we have moved most of our infrastructure to the cloud. That\u2019s part of our strategic plan for focusing on our expertise\u2014retail. Also, one of the advantages you have with Tableau Cloud is that it is flexible\u2014we can host it on our own infrastructure or we can host it using the Tableau infrastructure. Tableau: In your opinion, what are the benefits of a cloud-based strategy? Abhi: One is the initial investment it takes away, and the second\u2014which for us is the biggest one\u2014is the speed. It just gives you a very different kind of flexibility in terms of agility and speed. And in our analytics, the speed and the time-to-market is very important; there are certain analytics which are only relevant at a certain period of time. Tableau: Big data is getting a lot of attention in the retail and consumer brands industries. How does that impact what you do? Abhi: We have been testing big data for quite some time. In the retail industry, it's one of the bigger initiatives in terms of helping to uncover what shoppers and consumers really want. Tableau: You chose Google BigQuery as part of your big data platform\u2014why? Abhi: Google BigQuery provides us the simplicity we need; it also provides connectivity to sources which are not limited to our own data, but from all across the world. BigQuery has done a tremendous job of simplifying the back-end part and the big data in terms of query as well as the platform for Tableau. Tableau: Are you taking advantage of the ability to directly connect to your Big Query data from Tableau Cloud? Abhi: That's a great advantage for us and it really makes it simple. With the data connection you can literally connect to online to BigQuery and all the data you have on your BigQuery environment is now available to you for the reporting in minutes. Tableau: What would you have to do if that direct connection didn\u2019t exist? Abhi: If you don't have a BigQuery connection, you literally have to go out and use the data like in Excel or some Excel third-party data sources. Tableau: What sort of data do you look at using Tableau Cloud and Google BigQuery? Abhi: With BigQuery and Tableau we are combining various different data sources. To start with, a lot of traditional data from retail partners, also a lot of consumer data from loyalty and shopper cards. In addition to that, we combine and mash-up with the weather data\u2014with severe weather data\u2014which helps us look at insights which we have never seen before. Tableau: Does your cloud strategy make it easier to manage so many different sources of data? Abhi: One of the biggest challenges with traditional BI is the initial investment, the cost\u2014every time you bring in a new data source there's a huge capital investment and the time it takes to build the infrastructure. By utilizing the cloud you're really working on a different kind of timeline and different capital and cost, because you pay as you go. Tableau: In addition to cost, you mentioned the time it takes in traditional BI\u2026 is that better now, too? Abhi: From the time we enabled the Tableau Cloud with the back-end data sources I think it took us weeks compared to the in the past it would have taken months. Tableau: One final question: people sometimes talk about surprising discoveries they\u2019ve made with Tableau. Has using Tableau brought any unexpected results to Interactions Marketing? Giovanni: I think every time we look at the data it demonstrates for us different ways to see the activity and behaviors of the shoppers that we're analyzing. So the question that we ask often going into the problem is very different than the information that we're ultimately extracting and then utilizing to modify programs in-store."

From risk management information systems (RMIS) consulting to outcomes-focused analytics, Shelter Island Risk Services works to make its clients\u2019 information more available and understandable for improved risk management. In this video, Shelter Island Risk partner consultant Ira Skop shares how his small business uses the power of the cloud to share dashboards at a click while avoiding the need to maintain a server infrastructure through Tableau Cloud. Tableau: How is Shelter Island Risk using Tableau?\nIra Skop, Partner Consultant: We provide analytical consulting in the risk management industry, primarily casualty and property insurance; we look at insurance claims and the exposures that contribute to those claims. We use Tableau to provide our clients an analytical view of what their claims look like, where they're going, what the costs are, where and why they're happening. Tableau: After years as a Tableau Desktop customer, Shelter Island has recently adopted Tableau Cloud. Why?\nIra: We decided to use Tableau Cloud so that we can more easily share information with our clients. Tableau Cloud allows us to give our clients a quick and easy web interface to the data. Tableau: Did you consider implementing your own server in-house?\nIra: No. Bringing up a server and maintaining it for us is not an option. We don\u2019t have the resources\u2014human or technical. We're a very small organization and we don't have the infrastructure to put together a server and host it ourselves. Tableau: How did you share your data visualizations previously?\nIra: Before we had Tableau Cloud, we had to create Tableau packaged workbooks, ship them off to our clients by e-mail or FTP transfer, have them download the Tableau Reader, and use that to do their analysis. Or we would create static .pdf files and email them\u2026but that lacked the interactivity that Tableau has, that gives you the ability to play with your analysis and bring it to new levels. Tableau Cloud eliminates all of those hassles. Tableau: Can you describe this new, hassle-free process?\nIra: To see the reports a client would log onto the Tableau Cloud Server and bring up their reports\u2014in two seconds they bring it right up. Tableau is about speed, speed to analysis, speed to delivery of solutions\u2014and Tableau Cloud shortens the timeframe of delivering solutions to our clients. Now it's a single click from Tableau Desktop product to Tableau Cloud. Tableau: What\u2019s the process for giving new clients access to the reports you\u2019ve created for them.\nIra: Adding a new client to Tableau Cloud from our side is as simple as creating a new user ID and giving them the login credentials. Tableau Cloud allows us to easily show our analysis to our clients with very little investment or pain on their part. Tableau: What\u2019s involved in publishing your visualizations to Tableau Cloud\u2014is it fairly straightforward?\nIra: It is simply a matter of clicking a menu option in Tableau and choosing \u201cexport to server.\u201d Tableau: What do you think of the uploaded visualizations\u2014how does the user experience feel to you, a longtime Desktop user?\nIra: I have explored and worked with it and I\u2019m impressed with the richness of the web offering interface on the online product. Tableau: How are your clients benefiting from your use of Tableau?\nIra: Tableau has provided great value to us because of the speed with which we can take our information and produce meaningful visual representations. Our clients are amazed and very impressed with the richness of the way we can present information visually. It helps them in their decision-making. Tableau: And what about you? How have you benefitted from bringing Tableau into Shelter Island Risk?\nIra: We have used many other and tried many other products, and nothing provides solutions as quickly, as dynamically and as attractively as Tableau. Tableau: That\u2019s great to hear! What would you tell someone who was considering Tableau Cloud? Ira: Tableau Cloud is a great solution for companies like ours who have clients with a few users and who need to deploy solutions in multiple organizations\u2026 and who don't have the infrastructure to create their own server installation."

        "title": "CLINTEL: Data-driven clinical trials monitoring",
        "company": "CLINTEL",
        "content": "CLINTEL (formerly Advanced Bio-Logic Solutions) identified a growing need in drug development: enabling clinical development organizations to comply with FDA draft guidance on risk-based monitoring principles. CLINTEL saw the potential to develop easy-to-use tools that could also improve quality and significantly reduce costs. \u201cA typical phase III trial costs between $80-100 million,\u201d says Jeff Epstein, CLINTEL\u2019s CEO. \u201cThe industry estimates that up to 30 percent of clinical trial costs are related to site monitoring. Any reduction to site monitoring costs has the potential for significant impact, especially if you can increase quality along the way.\u201d In August 2013, the FDA finalized guidance on the topic of a \u201crisk-based approach\u201d to monitoring clinical trials. In it, the FDA advocates alternatives to regular, frequent onsite visits and verification of all data, which involve costly travel and provide little added benefit. Instead, they recommend approaches that identify risks to patient safety by utilizing critical data elements gathered in clinical data systems as a method of determining which sites warrant additional attention from clinical research associates (CRAs). Ultimately, this allows sponsors to better focus their monitoring efforts, sending CRAs to the sites whose risk level warrants more attention. \"The FDA advises that companies engaged in trials, specifically, the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries and their development organizations, should focus on what matters: risks to patients and risks to study data,\" Epstein says. \"But identifying those risks can be difficult.\" Since clinical trials are designed to collect important data about a potential drug\u2019s safety and efficacy, there\u2019s no shortage of data that can also be used to assess risk. The problem lies in getting that information to the right people at the right time, and in their language. The CLINTEL team, with its decade of experience offering electronic data collection system services for companies engaged in the clinical trials process, knew that an effort to enable this sort of analysis to clinically-focused users would face some distinct challenges. Jon Denne, Director of Business Development, explains, \u201cFrom executives to researchers, people need access to information in an actionable format. Systems capture the information, but most don\u2019t really have an analytics toolset that shows the entire picture.\u201d \u201cExcel might be the most widely used report engine in Pharma,\u201d Epstein adds. \u201cThe biggest risk, which I\u2019ve seen firsthand, is the risk of inaccuracy. And when people are basing decisions on incorrect data or inconsistent data\u2014that problem tends to proliferate.\u201d Despite these issues, spreadsheets have become the default report technology for many business users because they have simply had no other option. \u201cThere are tools out there that are good at providing bio-statisticians flexible insight into clinical data, but study management teams are often left to access data from several different systems and make sense of it on their own. And then they stitch it all together in spreadsheets,\u201d Epstein says. Using spreadsheets as the go-to tool for the non-programmer carries inherent hazards. In addition to accuracy and consistency issues, the presentation of data also can be a challenge. Spreadsheets can be impossible to digest at a glance, and slides or dashboards with 15 or 20 pages risk overwhelming the audience. \u201cWhen you present too much information, you see almost nothing,\u201d notes Adnan Shawkat, CLINTEL\u2019s Director of Information Systems. \u201cThere\u2019s Excel and then there\u2019s SAS,\u201d explains Shawkat, referring to the ubiquitous statistical analysis tool. \u201cUnless you're a statistical programmer, there\u2019s nothing in the middle. In addition to Tableau, CLINTEL considered several other business intelligence tools. This included Microsoft Reporting Services, which CLINTEL could have used for no additional cost as part of its Microsoft SQL Server licensing. \u201cWe evaluated many solutions in the market, but didn't find any as comprehensive as Tableau,\u201d says Shawkat. The trend among them was bespoke solutions that required costly consulting services. While CLINTEL is willing and able to adapt its services for those companies that want to leverage their existing investments in other reporting technologies, they decided against those software packages for its go-to offering. \"Most solutions require extensive configuration. There isn't much pre-built, out of the box,\u201d says Denne. \u201cOur goal is to offer an analytics portfolio that can stand on its own, but is highly configurable based on customer requirements. Ultimately this will shorten the software development cycle and reduce associated costs. In order for a solution to be viable it has to integrate with existing infrastructure effectively. As a core requirement, an analytics portfolio needs to be consistent, actionable, and readily available to all members of a clinical project management team. \u201cWe evaluated the market, and Tableau has the strongest capabilities in several areas. We liked the aesthetics of the visualizations\u2014it\u2019s clean, it\u2019s easy to use, and is ideal for a non-statistical end user who needs to access information quickly. We liked Tableau's functionality and ability to connect to disparate data sources. We especially liked the Tableau data engine.\u201d says Denne. CLINTEL has developed a data analysis solution and services set that is currently rolled out to several customers conducting phase II and phase III studies. CLINTEL\u2019s Tableau implementations connect to multiple data systems, including clinical trial management systems (CTMS) and electronic data capture (EDC) systems. \u201cThe great thing is that this solution is source agnostic. Your study could be set up using CTMS or EDC from Oracle, Medidata, BioClinica or any one of the companies who provide these source systems,\u201d says Shawkat. The ability to connect to cloud data sources also plays a big part in the solution. CLINTEL is currently working with customers who prefer the cloud-based model as it limits their maintenance and equipment burden. \"Providing a cloud option is essential to our offering. It allows access to key reporting technologies without requiring customers to make substantial investments into expensive server tools and technologies,\u201d says Epstein. CLINTEL analyzes customer data, creating Tableau visualizations that they can embed into customers\u2019 SharePoint sites. User access is managed through Active Directory or Trusted Tickets, depending upon the customer\u2019s preference. The solution is secure and 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. \u201cWe looked at everything, and for what we\u2019re trying to help our customers accomplish, Tableau is the easiest, most accessible and aesthetically-pleasing solution. And it\u2019s also going to be the most cost-effective,\u201d concludes Epstein. In particular, CLINTEL is pleased to note that with Tableau, it is able to: \u2022 Negate data silo issues. The siloed data problem has been overcome with Tableau\u2019s easy connection to disparate data sources. \u201cAny repository where they\u2019re collecting clinical information is what we\u2019re going to connect to with Tableau,\u201d says Denne. \u2022 Close the reporting gap. With Tableau, CLINTEL is providing self-service analysis that hits the \u201csweet spot\u201d between Excel and SAS. \u201cTableau makes the information that our customers already have accessible in an accurate way to people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have access without great expense and specialized skills,\u201d says Epstein. Leveraging the advanced reporting capabilities of Tableau, CLINTEL is able to create dynamic visualizations that deliver critical data points to the correct audience. \u2022 Increase speed-to-solution. Compared with the other data visualization tools out on the market, CLINTEL is able to produce solutions for its customers much more quickly using Tableau. \u201cTableau can get up and running a whole lot faster,\u201d Denne says. Tableau provides a solid engine for data visualization and can manage large and complex data sets. This has enabled CLINTEL to offer a robust visualization tool that will allow clinical teams to make more accurate decisions much earlier in the drug development process. \u2022 Create opportunities for savings. CLINTEL can see that its customers will be able to perform interim analysis on study sites much earlier, reducing risk and eliminating costs at under-performing sites. \u201cA decision to cut a site can save you $100,000. A decision to complete an interim analysis to revise your protocol could save you a whole lot more because it\u2019s affecting your entire program,\u201d says Epstein. \u201cNow the possibility exists where it did not previously.\u201d \u2022 Improve accuracy and enable insights. The easy-to-understand visualizations are helping customers avoid the inaccuracies and missed insights that were part of the Excel-based reporting world. \u201cWe can present complex, disparate data in a way that\u2019s easier for people to digest,\u201d says Shawkat."

But every project is different, and you have to build every one of those little pivot tables to get the data that you need to build the chart you want.\u201d This time-intensive, manual process had to be replicated any time there was a change to the data. \u201cIf something changed, then I had to go update everything individually!\u201d Baier says. After this process was complete, Baier would build her charts in presentation software, which took more time. \u201cThese are big studies, and I need to report a lot of findings to people who aren't research people\u2014or not even marketing people, sometimes. The presentations would be hundreds of slides long because I had all this data I had to share with them,\u201d she says. And simply outsourcing this time-intensive work wasn\u2019t an option. Susan\u2019s years of experience in marketing and business strategy are the \u201csecret sauce\u201d that allows her to parse out key insights in the data, and share its story with her clients. She simply has to work through the data herself, evaluating results and determining how best to show them. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing marketing strategy for 25 years. It's not value-added for my client to have me building charts. What's value-added for my clients is the data, my interpretation of it and my assistance in helping them understand it. Building the charts is only one step in the process, but it has to happen for me to see what the data says, and for my clients to see it too.\u201d A self-described \u201cdata nerd,\u201d Baier admits that capturing her customers\u2019 attention could be challenging. After all the investment and effort involved, expectations were high. \u201cClients don\u2019t want to pay thousands of dollars and see their results in an Excel file. The output has to look great.\u201d Baier recognizes that not everyone gets as excited about market research as she does. \u201cWhen I share results with clients, there are always people in the audience thinking, \u2018Sigh. Here we go. Two-hour market research presentation,\u201d Baier says, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m always excited about what we\u2019ve found, and I try to bring that energy to the client presentation. Having visually interesting charts helps a lot.\u201d Making her work more accessible to agency clients would require some major changes. \u201cI knew what agencies could do with this data,\u201d she says. \u201cBut in order for them to use it for the majority of their clients, I had to develop a project with a lower price point, and a faster schedule.\u201d In the spring of 2012, Baier realized she already had a tool that might help\u2014Tableau. Baier first heard about Tableau in the mid-2000s, and had lobbied previous employers to use it. When she opened Audience Audit, she purchased a Tableau Desktop license. Baier had played around with Tableau in a PC environment on her Mac, but hadn\u2019t had time to work with it extensively. \u201cI was trying to figure out how to make this major shift in the business, and all of a sudden it was like the light bulb went on\u2014\u2018Oh, wait a minute. I have Tableau, maybe this would help,\u2019\u201d she says. She wanted to get up and running quickly, so Baier decided to ask for help. Baier had been following Michael Cristiani of Powerhouse Factories, a leading Tableau Community member, on Twitter, so she contacted him and offered to hire him to build an initial workbook. \u201cHe was great. We went through a few rounds, and I came out with a small workbook, four or five worksheets that he built to show the data the way I wanted to show it.\u201d Baier then tried to replicate the workbook herself. \u201cI basically reverse-engineered it and figured out how he built it, and he was great about answering questions when I was stumped. Before I knew it I was doing stuff on my own, adapting, incorporating different views and finding new ways to explore my data.\u201d Baier now uses Tableau exclusively for presenting results to clients. \u201cI hardly ever do any kind of a Keynote presentation anymore. Sometimes I have clients who want that for executives, but 90 percent of my projects just go out in Tableau.\u201d She appreciates the ability to allow her clients to dig into their own data through using packaged workbooks and the free Tableau Reader application. \u201cI can add filters and give them a workbook that allows them to look at their data in different ways, export chart images for their own presentations, or download crosstabs for their own needs. Some of my clients don\u2019t want to do that, so I send them a PDF of the workbook\u2014or if they want specific images of particular slides for their own presentations to their client, I can export those.\u201d While the advanced statistical analysis portion of Baier\u2019s services remain the same, she estimates that using Tableau allows her to complete the rest of the analytics and deliver results 90 percent faster than before. \u201cSince incorporating Tableau into our work, we\u2019ve increased our project load by a factor of eight, our timelines have reduced by 50 percent and our revenue has increased by a factor of four,\u201d Baier says. \u201cTableau has taken a tremendous amount of time out of the process.\u201d While Audience Audit projects are customized for each client, the surveys and results files frequently share similar formats. This has allowed Baier to create some standard visualizations. \u201cWhen I have a new project, I pull up that workbook, switch out that data source to the new one, and I'm 80 percent of the way to a completed visualization for that set of data. So that\u2019s hugely time-saving,\u201d she says. This has allowed her to meet client needs at a speed simply not possible previously. \u201cFor example, we have a client with a big conference coming up, and they want this data,\u201d Baier says. \u201cWe just closed down the survey and dumped the data on Monday, ran the analytics like a bat out of hell, and I\u2019m in Tableau today\u2014Thursday\u2014visualizing it for the client. I'm going to be able to show that to the client a week after the survey closed. Before Tableau, there's no way we could have delivered on that deadline.\u201d And now if there is a change to the underlying data, Baier easily makes updates through Tableau. \u201cNow I don\u2019t have to go and change each one of those darned pivot tables!\u201d she says. \u201cEither there's already a calculation in Tableau to do it, or I can build one to do it automatically.\u201d While Baier\u2019s productivity has gone up significantly, she is proud to point out that quality has gone up, too. \u201cMy favorite part is digging into the data we\u2019ve collected. With Tableau I can see things that I couldn't see before\u2014because I didn't have the ability to look at data in all the amazing ways that Tableau has built-in. So our work is better\u2014in addition to being way more fun!\u201d\nBaier has saved so much time using Tableau that she has been able to make a better profit margin despite lowering her project rates. \u201cSince I started using Tableau, I've been able to reduce the fees on my projects by up to two-thirds with a higher margin per hour,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce I\u2019d tested this new process incorporating Tableau, I rebuilt my website, launched new pricing, new timelines, and we're off and running,\u201d Baier says. \u201cI hit the sweet spot where I could give my clients exactly what they wanted at a highly competitive rate, very quickly, very efficiently, and take on more projects.\u201d Now that Baier is using Tableau visualizations to present her findings, she is seeing more enthusiastic client reactions. \u201cInevitably, my clients love it\u2014they love it! Honestly, if I can get clients excited about looking at research data, that's a win. Nobody does that. And it's definitely easier with Tableau than it was before,\u201d Baier says. She attributes some of that enthusiasm to her new ability to answer customer questions on the fly. \u201cIt's not a static chart. It's linked to underlying data, so it's a conversation we can have and explore together as we go through it,\u201d she says. \u201cThat \u2018let me show you\u2019 part of Tableau\u2014\u2018Let\u2019s click on this and look at the differences.\u2019 The immediacy is great. I can watch my clients\u2019 jaws drop when they see the charts change with a click. And I simply can't do that any other way,\u201d Baier says. Her agency relationships have become far stronger in the year since she has implemented Tableau. \u201cThe most telling statement is that I have agencies incorporating our research into the work they sell to every client. To me, that's a huge vote of confidence. They see our work as a critical step in what they do.\u201d Another, more personal, benefit for Baier is that Tableau has helped her to keep her business small while meeting her business growth goals. \u201cTableau has given me a way to grow dramatically without having to take on folks to do repetitive Excel work. There will come a time when I may need to hire, but Tableau has pushed my bandwidth problem off substantially\u2014and when I do, I can hire people who will add value and find the work as interesting as I do.\u201d Baier can\u2019t imagine going back to her old way of doing business. \u201cTableau has become such a seamless part of what I do now. It really is responsible for what my business looks like today,\u201d she says. \u201cI started incorporating Tableau in this way just a year ago, and it has transformed what I've been able to do with my business just in that year . And a Mac version on the way? I can\u2019t wait!\u201d She continues, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have Tableau anymore? I\u2019d be a wreck. And you\u2019d have a lot of unhappy agencies \u2014and one very unhappy husband\u2014to answer to!\u201d"

Thorogood\u2019s Director Paul Balacky met up with us to share how Thorogood uses Tableau to provide sophisticated analytics. \u201cTraditional BI is quite summarized,\u201d he explains. \u201cTableau allows you to drill in and see what you can\u2019t see at a very high-level summary view.\u201d Tableau: How is Thorogood growing adoption of Tableau?\nPaul: The uptake of Tableau is interesting. As a company, we run BI update events and breakfast briefings and webcasts with Tableau, and we've created a lot of interest; some very good companies are being attracted to the power of Tableau. They are keenly interested in extending the use of Tableau beyond just a number of very good analysts and distribute it across their organizations. The growth within our customers is in sharing and extending and expanding their use of Tableau. Tableau: What do your customers value most about Tableau?\nPaul: They may have data warehouses which consolidate and aggregate that data in one place, but there's always a requirement to get data from elsewhere, and that's where people are looking at Tableau\u2014it gives people the ability to go on and do it for themselves, to make those connections. It\u2019s really self-service and data access and speed\u2014because Tableau is very quick to create some of those visualizations. Customers want to get more sophisticated. They see the value in having all of this data, but to realize that value they need analytics to be able to drill and -- and just see the insight that's there, any stories or any relationships that you can't see on looking at a very high level summary view of it, consolidated view. Tableau: So, you find that they value the self-service business intelligence capabilities in Tableau?\nPaul: It\u2019s to do with ease of use, the ability to self-serve\u2014the idea that people can get to all of the data that's in their business. People are looking to understand their data better, always. They\u2019re looking for trends and insights, connections. You may have a report which tells you that a set of customers or a particular region is doing particularly bad, but why and what is that about really? The ability to drill in and get into the detail is very important, and Tableau makes it much easier for people to do that. Tableau: How does Tableau compare with traditional business intelligence technologies?\nPaul: It's a movement from the traditional to the next step forward, and that's what our business is about; It's our lifeblood really. Tableau is a new wave in that we've got a traditional BI environment with all the traditional guys, Business Objects, Microsoft, the Oracle, Cognos and IBM, but what we're looking at here is a tool that can do an awful lot with a much lighter touch really. Tableau sits and points at data and allows the user just to get on and do their analysis. Traditional BI is all about really delivering information on the state of the business at a level that's quite high, it's quite summarized. There's the ability, you know, with some of the older technologies to be able to drill down and look at some of the detail. But it tends to take a lot of effort to do that. There's quite a high cost of ownership, and it's an awful lot of work needs to happen to get behind that. Tableau: How does Tableau impact your customer\u2019s business?\nPaul: Customers need to get their insight earlier and quicker, and Tableau certainly can do that. Things are moving a lot quicker in business. Certainly the volumes of data are increasing significantly, and the spread of that data is being captured in different channels through different environments. Being able to pull that together quickly to get insight and view what's happening without an excess level of bureaucracy or IT control really on top of that is a key benefit. Tableau: And how does Tableau impact your IT group?\nPaul: In essence IT is still there giving governance, assuring the quality of the data, making sure security is correct, but the ability to drop Tableau in enables business people to get on themselves and look at data. I think it's very clever in the way it does it actually. Tableau: How has your relationship with Tableau grown at Thorogood?\nPaul: In the last 18 months, there's certainly been an uptake in our customer base and we\u2019ve taken a very keen interest in Tableau and we're now engaging with Tableau as a partner, and we're looking forward to that relationship. Tableau is very open and easy to get on with."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: How did Tableau originally get introduced to your school?\nTed Curran, Executive Director of Finance: The primary impetus for Tableau was our dean\u2019s vision and strategic priority toward international expansion, visibility, and cross-campus collaboration. Tableau helps us put key performance indicators in place so that we can see how are we doing currently, where we\u2019re going, and ensure we're aligning with strategic goals. Tableau: How has Tableau helped you stay on strategy?\nTed: As a finance and business operations leader, being able to see quickly and easily how we're doing in our academic programs, our administrative programs and our research centers, and being able to see when things aren't aligned with plans is critical. When you have to set a budget a year in advance with business changing and business school education changing so rapidly, you need a tool that can help make sure you're on track from a financial and operational perspective and help you to change on a dime when you need to. We have some areas such as marketing where we've taken our entire budget and aligned it not only against strategic plans but also against where projects go across areas\u2014to see which things are truly planned vs. unplanned and essentially recognize which things don\u2019t come in a budget cycle. Tableau: Has Tableau helped you consolidate data across campus?\nTed: The first thing we did was look at what kind of reports people were creating and ask questions about what information could help them make better decisions. It turned out data was being sent in from 14 or 15 different systems. And often, the answer involved looking across different types of data, like events data and gifts data, to discover if, for example, people who attend events give gifts, if certain events drive more gifts, where did a particular individual give a gift and what was it designated for. So, rather than having all these people sending in reports, Tableau allowed us to create a consistent look and feel with consistent metrics and setup in place to ensure that we're all using the same definition for specific terms. It's fantastic not only for the school in understanding its own operations, but also when we report externally for surveys or other kind of benchmarking information. Tableau: Was it easy to get started and spread Tableau at the university?\nTed: The Tepper School of Business was able to do rapid prototyping in basically a two-week period, knocking out a 10-part dean's dashboard, which brought together the key information we wanted to track. This proved the concept for operational support, and it also became the springboard for other colleges on campus such as our engineering school or our facilities management to immediately latch onto the solution. We shared the work we were doing so we could have a consistency across colleges on the campus for financial data or admissions data or career center data. Tableau: How has Tableau improved your access and use of information?\nTed: The ability to access key information anywhere has been fantastic. The ability to access key information anywhere in a secure format has been a huge value component for us. Our dean can be across the world in Asia and be able to get a quick financial summary or understand at any time what our current numbers are in faculty, staff and students. The other benefit has been the drilldown capability, whether it's through the iPad or through a web browser. Say we have five students from a particular target demographic, to be able to drill in and understand basic information about these individuals\u2014maybe we met them at a particular career fair or they were recommended by an alum. This is very powerful information as we continue to increase the quality of our experience and grow the Tepper School brand and Carnegie Mellon around the world. Tableau: What\u2019s the biggest impact Tableau has had on you personally?\nTed: One of my primary roles is to steward the finances of the school and ensure that we are able to sustain ourselves over time, and continue to be a world-class business school. Tableau has really helped me make sure that we maintain the long-term sustainability of the business. For me, Tableau immediately put a flashlight onto our data, and that helped identify where we were strong, where we were weak, and what kinds of things we are missing in what we're collecting and capturing. Tableau has really helped us make sure that the data in our systems is solid. To be able to quickly see information visually rather than looking at a report and trying to make heads or tails of it really make it easy for people of all levels to understand. Equally important, it helps us to focus on the things that truly matter, what we're doing well in, where we can make adjustments, what are the outliers. Tableau: Can you give us examples of insight gained through Tableau?\nTed: Tableau's solution has helped us understand a number of things across both academic and administrative areas. For example, in academic areas seeing which classes are over or underutilized and being able to make changes on a room basis or making sure we have the right mix of faculty teaching appropriate classes. We\u2019re also looking at how we can use dashboards for our students, so that we can track their goals. Tableau is a fantastic solution to help really align business education with the career objectives are of our students. Maybe you're a military person and you want to go into operations. Well, there are specific things that will help you along that way, so why not capture and understand what they are so that the individual can see how their own progress is going against their own goals? Tableau: How is Tableau changing your industry?\nTed: One of my passions in finance is understanding return on human capital. In so many industries, whether consulting or software firms or education, somewhere between 70 and 80 percent of costs are people. And oftentimes when you look at financial statements, you're looking at an income statement, you're looking at a balance sheet, but you don't truly get the metrics around people, the value of your talent. I believe we've just scratched the surface in what we can do with regards to understanding our people, knowing the value of when you have a key person who leads, when you're not able to fill a position, or how your mobility index is going. For example, one of my upcoming kind of key objectives is skills inventory, understanding the skills that people have and where they want to go so that we make sure we're matching opportunities and giving a chance for people that maybe weren't aware of that had a desire to move into another area. For organizations that are really serious and passionate about growing their people and getting people new assignments and pushing them forward, being able to capture that key performance and human resources and goal data is going to be critical."

        "content": "Tableau: How did you find Tableau and what did you think when you found it?\nJonathan: I was the first analyst in the department, with a lot of RNs who had a whole lot of stacks of paper and Excel spreadsheets that they were working with. To help them organize and understand their data, I knew we wanted something more than what Excel could offer. I found Tableau Cloud, downloaded the 14-day trial, and within minutes just knew it was for us. It\u2019s the favorite piece of software I've ever used. Tableau: What is it that you love about working with Tableau? Jonathan: The way Tableau approaches data and visualizing data is the way my mind works. So what it lets me do is really move at the speed that I can think about things. I can think about something and within a split second or within a few seconds there it is on the screen for me to see. And that feedback loop being right there and so quickly lets me be incredibly productive. Tableau: How does Tableau save you time?\nJonathan: In terms of time saved, there's a lot of what I do that would not be possible without Tableau. We have close to 400 physicians that we're tracking each with somewhere between 10 and 20 measures that are being reported on roughly quarterly. We're tracking over 1,500 metrics at this point, which are at a unit level in the hospital; they're at an office level for the physician offices; they're per provider level, and then there's all the data we have on all the patients. Tableau lets us take in all of that data, identify outliers, and help performance improve in the hospital. Also, Tableau saves me time in that it lets me fail really fast, which is really great because I have a limited amount of time for analysis. Tableau lets me iterate through a lot of different ideas and analyses really quickly to come to a set of insights. Or in cases where I need to report on a specific set of measures, Tableau enables me to have the report the way that we need it to look and get that output really quickly to people. Tableau lets us take in thousands of records each month and aggregate it quarterly or annually to look at individual performance or at an office or group level and compare performance with other providers. Tableau: What kind of data do you work with?\nJonathan: We have separate electronic health record systems for our inpatient and outpatient services, and there's no kind of master dataset I get out of those. So there are different reports, and I get different little slices of sets of data from each of them. Tableau has been fabulous for being able to incorporate and organize all these different data sources. I use Tableau to clean up that data as well as for the analysis and downstream reporting and delivery. Tableau: How has it impacted the analysis you deliver?\nJonathan: The quality management department\u2019s view is that we don't own the data. It's really the physicians' data; it's the nurses' data; it's the patients' data. Using Tableau, we're able to turn that data around and get it out to them faster. People are getting to see data that they've only seen once a year and they're seeing it much more often. Maybe it's data they've never gotten to see in an aggregate form before, and they're getting to see aggregates and comparisons. We're able to add more value that we in the quality management department bring to it in terms of our analysis and push that back out to them much more quickly. Tableau: What are some specific insights Tableau has helped you uncover?\nJonathan: With Medicare, there's value-based purchasing where they're implementing pay for performance and withholding revenues based on certain measures. For example, the number of patients who come in with pneumonia and what kind of treatment that they get within a certain time period of their arrival. So, one of the things we've been able to do with Tableau is analyze each month where we're at with regards to these different numbers, project our gain or loss on this measure. We can identify areas where we're performing and meeting the target and also where we're not meeting the target. That way, we can address it in a timely fashion before the end of the measure. In the case of this particular set of measures, the reporting that we actually get from Medicare is several months to a year after the data. So being able to act on it in a more timely basis lets us actually meet the measure in a better fashion. Tableau: How has Tableau changed the way you work?\nJonathan: The environment that we're in is one where things are changing a lot, and our hospital and physician practices are getting more integrated as we go along. For patient quality, for safety, for payment we have to monitor more and more metrics and there are new bits of data coming in all the time. Between its blending features and the ease of connecting to different data sources, Tableau lets me pull all that together easily so I can focus more on the analysis piece. The days that I get to spend more of my day in Tableau, those are the better days. I look forward to the time when I get the dataset ready and I'm able to dive in and look at something. With some of the data, I'm often the first person who has seen the data, and it's kind of like skiing and making first tracks in fresh powder. That\u2019s just really fun to see what comes up on the screen. To be able to turn it around and share that with my coworkers is a really wonderful thing. Tableau: Was it easy to learn to use Tableau on your own?\nJonathan: I like the software so much I bought a student license and used it at home. I got really active on the Tableau community forums, and used that as a source for other people's visualizations. I saw what they had done with things, and took them on as problem sets to learn things with datasets that I didn't have access to or wouldn't be working with in my day job. That process really rapidly accelerated my own learning curve."

        "content": "As a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company, Accenture employs approximately 259,000 people serving clients in more than 120 countries. In this interview, Accenture Consultant Mike Gabour stopped by to talk about the role Tableau is playing in improving client services. \u201cTableau gives us the opportunity to display something to our users that they've never seen before,\u201d he says. Tableau: How is Tableau changing the field of management consulting?\nMike: This is something that's revolutionized the way I work with my team and show them what's in my mind, and my assumptions about what's happening in our data. In the past, data visualization [and] data validation was a very static and localized process. I could create something, and it was limited. Today, I can hook up Tableau to my existing data, understand it, and share my views on how to analyze that data like I've never been able to do before. I'm able to sit down within a few hours and come up with some great insights to what we have just sitting in data warehouses, just waiting to be discovered. And I'm able to share that with my colleagues at a click of a button. Tableau: How is Accenture using Tableau?\nMike: Our strategic workforce planning solution has a wide audience\u2014from the executive level all the way down to the on the ground analysts. Tableau was able to help us cater to that audience by giving us an opportunity to create a dashboard that was drillable and able to view things at a high level of detail. Tableau: What does Tableau help you do differently? Mike: Tableau allows us to connect to a variety of our external and internal databases at the click of a button. Now, we're able to visualize those outputs very easily, very quickly. During a leadership call, someone can ask me something that I haven't designed and quickly while I'm sharing my screen I can redesign my entire workbook right in front of them and give them the answers to the questions they've asked real time, which is something that I haven't been able to do anywhere else before. Tableau: How did you get started with Tableau?\nMike: About two years ago, my senior management team tasked me with the project of creating a strategic workforce planning solution. But the Friday before my Monday meeting with leadership, the entire solution crashed. I threw it away and went online to try to find other options to help solve this business problem. I downloaded everything I could get my hands on, used it, and evaluated it. Tableau came out to be the only one that was scalable. It gave me flexibility and ease of use, and it provided the best option for our users, the best usability. I was able to build an entire solution that took me months with competing products and recreate it within one weekend. Tableau: Who is using this information and what\u2019s the impact?\nMike: Accenture is made up of multiple geographies all over the world, and each one of those geographies has a talent strategist that has to interact with the data for his particular geography as well as all other geographies that are affected by the loaning and borrowing of resources across the globe. The interesting thing we can do with Tableau is hook up into that massive view that has users all over the world interacting with the same integrated database, but at their level of detail from their perspective, which is really powerful and something we can't do anywhere else in the organization. Tableau: How has that consolidated view impacted time savings?\nMike: Before we designed our strategic workforce planning solution in Tableau, we were working with separate Excel workbooks for each geography. This can be very cumbersome, difficult to use, slow, and not integrated at all. With Tableau we're able to have one dashboard for the entire organization. Now, each geography can log into the same view and access that data without having to worry about the source or the content; it's all one unified source. Tableau: And you\u2019ve given users the ability to work with data, too?\nMike: We created a subsequent tool that allowed users to interact with the data, to enter data and see those results in Tableau. The user interface allows our clients to log into the system, change their assumptions, and then realize those changes in Tableau. So they can make a change on a very granular level of detail, and find out what that's done to an entire geography or the organization as a whole. Rather than having to affect the complete database, they can just edit the parameters that are most important to them. We're able to give the user the ability to do a what-if analysis real time using real data, real assumptions at a level of detail that is meaningful to them. Tableau: What\u2019s the impact of Tableau on you personally?\nMike: Tableau has given me a reason to look at data a whole new way. It lets me interact with my data like I've never been able to. It\u2019s given me the opportunity to be excited about my data, which is something that is very difficult to do when you're looking at a spreadsheet of numbers. There's not much going on there. When you're able to view things a different way, drill down, colorize, visualize, that's powerful. That's powerful, it gives me satisfaction, and it gives us the opportunity to display something to our users that they've never seen before. Tableau: Why do you recommend Tableau?\nMike: Tableau is great because it allows you to scale. You can download it today, create your views, what you have in your head. But you don't stop there. You can begin with getting people excited about what you have, and naturally they'll want to share it. I'm able to go from my desktop and publish out to the Server with a click of a button with seamless integration\u2014without having to do any re-work, not having to buy separate products."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: What do you do at ISVG and how does Tableau help?\nJohn Hitzeman, IT and Analysis Coordinator: We study terrorism, extremism, and transnational crime worldwide. We've been doing open-source collection since 2002 with about 100 students who go through articles and pull out all the data from there. Basically, they're human entity extractors. They pull out the events, the groups involved, and the individuals involved, and they take that and put it into a database that we condense in Tableau and analyze. Tableau: What\u2019s a typical use of Tableau that impacts your business?\nJohn: We use Tableau in a variety of different ways. First, we exported our data out of the database, and loaded it into Tableau just to see what it looked like. The results were so good that we decided to go with Tableau Desktop where we could hook directly to the database and perform that type of analysis straight off the server. Our administrative teams can actually connect live to our server, show our product on an iPad, and say, here's everything we've collected for the last 10 years. Another way that we use Tableau is we track what our students are doing using Tableau, and develop dashboards to show their productivity\u2014how many entries they're doing per hour and how many hours a week that they're working\u2014so traveling administrators can make budgetary decisions based on what they see in Tableau via their portable device. Tableau: Who else uses your data\u2014what types of clients?\nJohn: Most of our clients are in the government, Department of Defense. We receive grant money from them to perform open source collection throughout the world. Our students help us provide information to them at a fraction of the cost of a full-time analyst employed by the government. We have about 100 students that collect this information, and each of those students is paid 8 to $10 an hour, which is about a tenth of the cost of an analyst. Everything we do is open source and unclassified. So whenever we give our information out to the government, they can share it with allies, share it with other governments or even share it between levels of our own government without violating any kind of secrecy. Tableau: Has working with Tableau changed the way you work at ISVG?\nJohn: Before Tableau, we were very top-down in our analysis. There were basically three people in the organization who could do it: two PhDs and me. I\u2019d pull the data from the database as a query and give it to them to run through their statistical analysis tools. If we needed to do a trend-level model or trend models, we had to pass it up instead of down in our organization. With Tableau, we've trained our students how to build dashboards themselves so that they can produce reports that then get distributed. Instead of a top-down model, we now have a more distributed model in how we conduct our analysis and a more grassroots effort to produce content. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted productivity?\nJohn: I have a team of 10 people who are all trained in Tableau Desktop, who can produce dashboards and create reports. We have a turnaround time of a day instead of a week or more. Instead of doing very few reports a year, now we can do multiple in a week. We can actually produce about five-a-week using just students. Tableau: How has that changed what is possible?\nJohn: It\u2019s changed how we model our analysis. Instead of just modeling our own information coming from the ISVG database, we've expanded out into our community and started working with the university's administration to handle issues like spacing\u2014so which classrooms are most filled, which ones are least utilized? We've also reached out to the West Haven Police Department and analyzed some of their CAD data so that they can see where crime is happening and how to best allocate personnel to respond to that crime. And by integrating Tableau into our classrooms and teaching students how to use Tableau, they become more competitive in the field. Tableau: Has Tableau impacted the questions you ask of your data?\nJohn: Because we have Tableau and can slice and dice the data instantly, we can start to answer questions that we never thought to ask before. Like, which terrorist groups are the most effective? We connect to the server, pull the data, have it all at our fingertips, and just start tearing into it. Tableau: What\u2019s Tableau meant to you personally?\nJohn: Tableau is an awesome time saver. It\u2019s freed up my time. It has essentially changed my mission in the organization from getting people data to getting people educated. My entire week used to be was spent querying data, visualizing it, and producing a report. Now I\u2019ve trained other people how to use Tableau, so that they can produce reports, produce dashboards, produce anything that we need them to, or even query the data using Tableau so that I don't have to. With the time saved, I\u2019m creating a team, growing the team, and working more closely with university administration to teach others how to analyze data and share the knowledge using Tableau."

Essentially we sell traffic information\u2014for about 2 million miles of road around the world\u2014to customers so so they know what's happening on the roads and how to work their way around it. Tableau: That's a whole lot of data!\nKen: We view ourselves as a Big Data company that pulls in crowd-sourced information from 100 million devices and vehicles out there to build traffic information that we sell across a variety of verticals, including public sector, automotive, mobile, fleet, and media. Tableau: What\u2019s the business problem you wanted Tableau to solve?\nKen: We create a national traffic scorecard. We've been doing it since about 2007 and in the past, it's been a very laborious, three-month process. We\u2019d have to comb through all our records, do a variety of custom analysis, and print out the results in a book that people could come to our website and sign up and to get. We wanted to create a dynamic process that was much easier to do, much more scalable, and allowed us to basically update this data on a monthly basis and allow people to see a visualization of what the traffic looked like across all these metro areas via the scorecard. Tableau: So exactly how much data are we talking about?\nKen: We immediately glommed onto Tableau as an opportunity for us to take our visualization of scorecard back in November of 2011. We had built a data store of multiple petabytes\u2014every minute we're storing traffic information across 2 to 3 million segments of road. We\u2019re storing that in SQL. So, it's literally petabytes of data that I compress a little bit before bringing it into Tableau. On the live side of Tableau Public, we're leveraging about 4 million rows of data at any one point in time to crunch and build our charts and graphs and visualizations. Tableau: How do you and your clients use the traffic scorecard?\nKen: It can be used to answer everything from \u201cWhere should I build the next road?\u201d and \u201cHow is my road infrastructure performing?\u201d to \u201cAre my fleet drivers speeding?\u201d to \u201cWhat's the fastest way for me to go from point A to point B?\u201d Local press and radio and TV stations do interviews with us on the state of traffic. By ranking and tracking 200 cities across North America and Europe for their congestion levels on a monthly basis, we were able to determine which cities are the most congested. Brussels is the most congested city in the world right now. In the US, LA and Honolulu are neck and neck. But the scorecard is really just the tip of the iceberg of the information that INRIX can provide. We use it as an entry point with governments and departments of transportation to help them understand the vastness of the data, the richness of the data we can provide. Tableau: How much time has INRIX saved with Tableau?\nKen: Tableau has allowed us to accelerate the process with which we update our scorecard. Rather than completing a three-month process to create a new scorecard every year, I now create a new scorecard every month and it's literally a three-hour process to update it. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted you personally?\nKen: Tableau has fundamentally allowed me to be a lot more creative in how we create the scorecard and for people to be a lot more dynamic in how they use the scorecard. It\u2019s allowed me to answer questions in a quick and easy way on the fly. Tableau: How else are people at INRIX using Tableau?\nKen: Tableau is starting to be used across our company and people are finding ways to take not just the nugget of scorecard data that we've created, but take INRIX\u2019s overall traffic archive data and find new ways to visualize the data, drive insights from the data, and new use cases for that data. Tableau: How has it been partnering with the consultants at Tableau?\nKen: The responsiveness and the flexibility that Tableau had in working with me and understanding the complexity of the project we were undertaking helped us to break the rules and do what hadn't been done before in Tableau Public. Ours was a big project. And one of the twists that we threw in was the requirement to create our scorecard in five different languages. So Tableau essentially helped us create five different versions of Tableau in different languages, so we could have a scorecard customized in English, French, Spanish, German and Italian."

The best-in-class visual analytics solution answers almost every question this leading U.K. provider of karaoke services asks: how many people are booked into our karaoke bars next week? What drinks and food do they prefer? Which are the most popular songs to perform? Answers to these and a multitude of other questions are a click away, and available in a real-time, compelling, easy to use format. By standardizing on Tableau for business intelligence, Lucky Voice is growing revenues, redeploying hard-pressed development resources away from reporting into creating new karaoke services, and maximizing revenue per customer. It all adds up to a complete return on investment in only a few weeks. That is definitely something to sing about. Karaoke calling Lucky Voice is redefining the karaoke interactive entertainment experience. A network of private karaoke bars throughout the U.K., an online karaoke experience, and pay-as-you-go solutions for venues and operators enable tens of thousands of customers to sing along to their favourite songs every day.\nThe company\u2019s growth has inevitably led to an increased demand for real-time, detailed reporting\u2014and this quickly led Lucky Voice to Tableau visual analytics. \u201cWithin five minutes of trialling Tableau, I knew I had arrived at my destination,\u201d says Nick Thistleton, Managing Director, Lucky Voice. \u201cWe looked at various alternatives, including Jaspersoft, Crystal Reports, and Microsoft PowerPivot, but all of these were either too expensive for our small dynamic company, too complex, or otherwise unmanageable. Tableau did everything we needed straight out the box.\u201d The intuitive, easy to use Tableau visual analytics technology is now the standard reporting mechanism for Lucky Voice. Live for one year and deployed in one day, the best-in-class hosted solution enables Thistleton and his team to analyze almost any aspect of the business in real-time. Data associated with the performance of each of the Lucky Voice karaoke bars, total booked and forecast revenue, the song catalog, and the demand for drinks and food is available in dashboards which can be filtered, highlighted, and drilled into. This seamless insight into business performance accelerates trusted decision making and enables Lucky Voice to tailor its services to best meet customers\u2019 needs\u2014and drive revenue growth. For instance, staff working in the karaoke bars can review their sales performance via the in-bar reservation system and compete with one another to see who sells the most. A competitive incentive program has helped boost food and drinks revenues in each bar. Return on investment in a few weeks Tableau paid for itself within a few weeks of going live too. How? By pinpointing ways for the business to capitalize on revenue-generating opportunities. The visual analytics also frees developers from the burden of report generation to focus on other critical tasks, like the new touch-screen Web platform that serves up the songs in the bars. \u201cDevelopers used to provide the reports; however, changes were slow and difficult, and you couldn\u2019t play with the data. Using Tableau the team can ask incidental questions on the fly, without engaging with the developers. Freeing up development time has saved Lucky Voice a significant sum of money,\u201d says Thistleton. Tableau has helped change the culture of the company too, delivering faster, more accurate decision making, and making everyone more aware of\u2014and in touch with\u2014the performance of the business. \u201cKnowledge used to be concentrated at the top of the company,\u201d says Thistleton. \u201cTableau empowers the real decision makers elsewhere in the company, such as the people working in the bars and the ones that manage the online enquiries.\u201d The solution has also provided valuable reporting data that might otherwise have been buried and overlooked in a spread sheet. For instance, a simple enquiry in Tableau revealed that on New Year\u2019s Eve 2012, karaoke fans had rejected the traditional sentiments of \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d in favor of \u201cGangnam Style\u201d by the K-Pop rapper Psy. The song accounted for almost a quarter of the 100,000 songs sung that night on Lucky Voice\u2019s online service. Lucky Voice published a press release with the finding, and received blanket, international coverage. That is equivalent to hundreds of thousands of dollars of free promotional marketing from a couple of reporting clicks. Thistleton concludes, \u201cWe were making decisions in the dark before we had Tableau; everything we did was based on instinct. Now we have real time insight into the business, which is helping to maximize sales growth.\u201d"

        "content": "The Information Lab is a team of certified Tableau software consultants in the United Kingdom. Tom Brown founded The Information Lab after discovering a passion for helping people make sense of data -\u2014 a passion fueled by five years of working on traditional business intelligence projects which \u2018just never seemed to be what people actually wanted.\u2019 After evaluating Tableau in 2008, Tom realized the world of BI had changed and became an evangelist and specialist in Tableau. Tableau: Tableau literally changed your life. How did you find us?\nTom: I first met Tableau four years ago trying to find solutions to help customers become self-reliant in business intelligence. We were working with lots of Microsoft technologies, which gave us great databases, but they weren't taking us that last mile to make our customers self-reliant. When we found Tableau, everything changed. I have a team of five people who are enthusiastic and love their work. They work in the evenings and weekends without me asking them to. Tableau made our work fun again. Tableau: Who are your customers?\nTom: Tableau is used across all industries, and that's reflected in our customers. They all have data, and they all have a need to get some value from it. We work with some large banks, lots of universities, in the health care space. And we also work with some very, very small companies. We're not going into IT particularly but into the business departments. So we're working with people in marketing, analysts, in the HR department and the finance teams, everybody! Tableau: How do they describe the value of Tableau?\nTom: Tableau is productive. Our customers are working many, many times faster than in the tools they were using before. It's distributed. There are many, many more people in the business able to contribute to data-driven discussions because of Tableau. And it\u2019s bringing the fun back into work. Tableau: Give us some examples of the impact Tableau has made.\nTom: We recently worked with a large record label in the UK that collects streaming Spotify data\u2014some really big datasets\u2014and they use Tableau Server to push that information back out to more than 600 clients. In health care, we work with people who are trying to use Tableau Desktop to do some really detailed analysis about why certain people present particularly late with cancer. They're looking for things like geographic clustering, for example, but by type. If you're an older male living in an inner city, you're very unlikely to go to the doctor. Once they found that information out, they specifically target those people with marketing, because if they can get them to present early to the doctor then they've got a a much higher survival chance. We worked with a small but significant retail company in London who was sending out marketing brochures to their clients. But they weren't taking any account of who those clients were or where they were located geographically. So we used Tableau's mapping functionality as a filter to exclude people who would never likely come in, because they lived so distant from the actual physical store. That saved them a lot of money in marketing and let them focus on the right people. Tableau: How is Tableau changing the way people work? Tom: The biggest change is that since everybody can use Tableau, the contribution to decision-making is coming from everywhere. The vast majority of people learning Tableau are people in the business, not IT. They're the people that know about the business and can make decisions. And the feedback generally is that their work just became fun again. When we're training them, we see smiles and we see people suddenly feel empowered again. If every decision needs to be rooted through someone in IT, then that's not particularly empowering; Tableau is changing that. Tableau: How does Tableau support your initiatives?\nTom: The greatest thing Tableau is doing is continuing to build great software, which is taking us to places that their competitors can't go. That gives us a level of confidence. We're a small business. Yet we when we take our software out to companies, we know that we can compete with much, much larger organizations. Tableau really packs a punch. Tableau: What is it like working with Tableau as a company?\nTom: The partnership with Tableau is very real. With many other companies, partnerships are not necessarily two-way. We're out there every day meeting customers and telling them about this great new way of working. Tableau gives us a great deal of support--through direct connections into the sales team, with partner managers, and with the development team\u2014 it's a two way street. Tableau: How has business grown?\nTom: Tableau is having extensive growth in the UK, and I think that will continue to grow apace. In one year, we\u2019ve grown from me to a team of five. We became the first Tableau Gold partner outside the U.S., which is exciting for us. And we expect that growth to continue as Tableau's growth and recognition continues in the UK. We also continue dedicating a lot of our resources to supporting the community. Our website specifically helps other people using Tableau; we decided to flood it with information that would help people. We write blog posts every week. The Tableau Hub brings together all the Tableau resources that we can find, and that's really been helping our customers and the rest of the Tableau community. Tableau: What does the future hold?\nTom: There's a massive amount of interest in v8. And I think what Tableau presents with version 8 at their conference in San Diego is really going to take Tableau to not just the next level but levels that people hadn't even imagined yet!"

        "content": "Under the leadership of Mel Stephenson, The Data Studio has been at the forefront of business intelligence consulting and training in the UK since 2010. Achieving the status of Tableau Silver Partner, they championed Tableau Software with notable clients Honda, Skype and Accenture. In 2013, they merged with Tableau Gold Partner InterWorks. In this interview, Stephenson talks about how Tableau gives employees autonomy, gets them excited about data, and empowers them to take on ownership of their work and their responsibilities to customers. Tableau: What made you start The Data Studio?\nMel: It was out of a real passion for Tableau. I couldn't believe what a transformative effect such a simple-to-use tool can have on any organization, and I really enjoyed helping other companies see the benefits from that. Tableau: What\u2019s the benefit of being easy to use?\nMel: It\u2019s no longer a tool which is just for management; it\u2019s for every level of an organization, so everybody has the opportunity to get really good, clear feedback on what they're doing. This quality of information and power to inform better decision-making was never possible before. I find it stunning. The more you use Tableau, the more parts of the organization it touches; and every part it touches it has another effect. Tableau: How can Tableau change a company culture?\nMel: I almost don't know where to start the list. Every time you use Tableau, you improve processes; you increase the quality of customer care that you're able to deliver. It can change the way you manage a company by giving people more autonomy and their own feedback on their own performance. It removes the requirement for management to get involved and oversee to the same extent as before, so a lot less back-seat driving. By being more transparent, you give people a greater sense of ownership of not just the company and their own actions but their responsibility to customers as well. Tableau: So the value of Tableau is empowering employees \u2014 is that quantifiable?\nMel: Tableau is not just for just big companies, and it's easy to use. So the thing that's really valuable about Tableau is how cheap it makes it for any organization to answer a question. And then they come back with an even better question so there is iterative improvement\u2014there's so little human cost in delivering that successive improvement that you actually embrace the opportunity to \u201cmake it better.\u201d Tableau helps get this virtuous cycle going, and you're willing customers and users to come back with an even better questions, because Tableau makes it easy to make everybody look like a superstar. Tableau: Do you feel a real attraction to Tableau in the UK?\nMel: I think it's clear to us in the UK that Tableau is becoming popular very quickly. The adoption rate is high and the enthusiasm and appetite for that product is only a few years behind the U.S. Everywhere I go where people getting their first sight of Tableau, that same enthusiasm and evangelism, that same wow is in the UK now. Tableau: Personally, how has Tableau impacted your work? Mel: Tableau has unlocked a huge amount of passion for me and excitement about going to work every day. We work with different organizations from week to week, each with different questions and a different set of challenges, but every single time I know that it's going to be fun. It's going to be quick, and it's going to be easy. People are going to love the results, and it's going to be for them\u2014it's completely about them; they totally own it. And for me that's so rewarding, it's fantastic."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Zilliant's price-optimization and sales-effectiveness applications help companies price more profitably and sell more effectively using data-driven science instead of guesswork. In this video, Eric Hills and Dave Kurak stopped by to share with us what a difference Tableau is making for Zilliant and its customers. Tableau: How is Zilliant using Tableau with your clients?\nEric: We use Tableau to help the customer understand their business and where there are opportunities to grow. Tableau\u2019s visualizations play a critical role in the value we create for our customers by helping us really see top-down and bottoms-up what's going on in businesses and how our science-based models can really help them not just understand but actually predict what's going to happen in their business. Our mission is to help our customers grow their top and their bottom line and P&L growth is a senior executive priority. So Tableau gives us the ability to help busy senior executives visually understand how their business works, where the opportunities are to improve, and ultimately how to change, how to make better decisions to drive and capture those improvement opportunities. Tableau: How did you get started with Tableau?\nDave: We use Tableau daily, but it all started with our scientists that help create the algorithms for the price recommendations needed a way to help visualize all the data and statistical information. That really got us onto Tableau and then we made a decision to just incorporate it in our product and let our customers author and create their own content.\nEric: Over the years, it's evolved into an OEM relationship where we've embedded Tableau Server content into our applications, as well as continuing to use Tableau Desktop to do the customer data analysis. Tableau: Tell us about that product and how it incorporates Tableau.\nDave: I focus on a product that's called Margin Max that helps companies make better pricing decisions. We take a lot of financial transaction data from our customers, break it into segments, and provide guidance and price recommendations and a set of analytics that helps companies understand how their business is progressing with regards to the prices that we're putting in market. Tableau\u2019s dashboard is great; it\u2019s embedded within our application through the web, and it's just a very easy way to visualize a large amount of data. We have customers with thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands and millions of SKUs, and we're able to represent all of that data in a pretty compact view and use the colors and the different visualizations to help highlight what we're looking for. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted business?\nEric: Tableau has been a strategic capability for Zilliant and for our customers, because it enables us to do better work faster. Prior to working with Tableau, using more traditional BI, it would sometimes take 3,000 to 5,000 hours to implement our technology. These days that's more like 500 to 1,500 hours. We are enjoying a 3 or 4x improvement in productivity, and a lot of that has to do with the fast, easy visualizations we get through Tableau.\nDave: Tableau has been a game changer for us. We came from a world where we were creating a lot of analytical content and trying to lay this down to our customers and adapt their business to this content. And now we're shifting toward going in very lean. We're focusing on having the right data, and then we're able to very quickly build the right content for that customer, at that point in time\u2014as opposed to trying to build the perfect set of content for everybody. Tableau: What is it like to work with Tableau as a company?\nEric: Tableau has been a great partner to Zilliant. The people themselves are really high quality; they're very passionate, and have been very responsive. Tableau\u2019s product is top-tier, high-caliber technology that we can rely on to be very robust, reliable, scalable, and dependable. That was critical in our decision-making around embedding the technology into our product, because essentially we are only as good as the components we put into our product. And Tableau's vision and reputation in the marketplace\u2014as with any business when you associate with winners, with high-growth, high-caliber companies\u2014brings some of that aura to Zilliant itself."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: How did you come up with the idea of a business intelligence Olympiad?\nJim Raper, Data Manager: We began using Tableau back in 2005 and found it enabled our users to be more efficient. But convincing the rest of the departments in the city to try it was a problem. My assistant, Doris Phillips, came up with the idea to have an Olympiad to let all the analysts compete using Tableau. Tableau: Sounds fun! What happened this year at the competition?\nJim: We used the Titanic passenger list as the data set in our 2008 Olympics. This year, our BI community said, let's use real business problems. So we tasked all teams to use their own data and create a dashboard that reflected one of their key business metrics, but also use best practices as far as data visualization goes. Once the analysts got the tool in their hands, they were promoters of it. And when their managers saw that they could get something faster, they were more willing to buy Tableau. Tableau: Word is you added some \u201cpressure\u201d at the last minute.\nJim: To throw just a little wrinkle and put a little pressure on our analysts, a day before the competition, our city manager met with them and said, \"We have a category 3 hurricane headed to Charlotte; because of the one that hit the Gulf a couple of days ago, all the oil refineries are shut down; gas prices are spiking by over $2 a gallon, and by the way, there was a bioterrorism attack against the Charlotte water system and all the management layer is gone.\u201d Then we gave them 24 hours to adjust their dashboards and show us how the events would affect business. Tableau: What do people learn through this competition?\nJim: A competition and training against metrics improves the capability of the analyst. And the added pressure of a deadline and something coming out of left field stretches them. They learn what management wants to see and also what are the best data visualization practices from the technical side. Tableau: Who uses Tableau and what sort of best practices do they use?\nJim: We have over 40 different analysts within the city that have Tableau Professional on their desktop; an equal number use Tableau Server. And we\u2019ve embedded BI and analytics further into the business\u2014with about two-thirds of our departments using Tableau. The businesses are finding real value in using good BI tools and most importantly, using the best practice of getting raw data into actionable business intelligence to visually present to a manager's eye. What we've seen from the departments that have adopted Tableau is that their analysts are able to work faster and smarter. They have more time to discover what they don\u2019t know in a data set instead of just focusing on producing a report. And so the managers are getting a richer blend of data. Tableau: What is the City\u2019s data environment like?\nJim: Charlotte is not much different than any commercial business or government entity. We have data in Oracle databases, in SQL databases, data in Access databases, lots and lots of Excel spreadsheets, and flat files. Our raw data is coming in multiple formats from multiple sources. It\u2019s common to pull data from multiple sources, as well as our data warehouse and blend it on a daily basis. Tableau: What\u2019s the benefit of being able to blend all that data?\nJim: The questions keep coming and the time frame to answers gets shorter. We've seen evidence of over a 20-time improvement in time from raw data to finished product. A 20-fold increase in productivity is something that all managers would like to see from their analysts. And management Finds it a little easier to visualize it with a dashboard vs. thumbing through pages of Excel spreadsheets. Tableau: And what was the result of the 2012 Business Intelligence Olympiad?\nJim: When you have 10 teams competing and they're looking at real business problems, they come up with very different solutions. Afterwards, talking with each other as a community, we get a lot of sharing across the various business groups, and that's helping to break down silos. It's also helping to train our analysts up. The level of expertise of our analysts in 2012 is a whole lot better than it was in 2008."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: In your mission to keep more kids in school, what is data\u2019s role?\nSteven Gering, Chief Academic Officer: I'm a big data nerd, so I really think data has the impetus to drive change. It gets people focused on what we need to do and why we need to do it. Unlike anything else, data can take our personal opinion out of it, show us what's actually happening with our kids, and leads us to some thoughtful decision making. It gets us moving in a way that nothing else can do besides data. Tableau: Tell us about the Early Warning System in your district.\nSteven: The early warning system is really exciting. There's been a lot of research and literature about schools creating an early warning system, so we had a researcher study 7,000 students, most of whom who have graduated, some who didn't. She then told us that 86 percent of the dropouts had early warning signs or tipping points. If we could have intervened, we could have probably kept them on track. So she identified tipping points from third through sixth grade. There were different tipping points for middle school and different tipping points for high school. What we've done slightly different than most school districts is now we took that research and we turned it into a dashboard through Tableau. Tableau: Do you have a lot of data on these students?\nSteven: In education, we're drowning in data; we get massive amounts of data. As a high school principal, I'd get volumes of reports that were generated downtown and sent to us\u2014 just piles of paper that we were somehow supposed to make sense of. Tableau: So the dashboard helps you manage and analyze all that data?\nSteven: Yes, but also we were able to customize it with Tableau. Anything else off the shelf would never have had the flexibility to do what we're trying to do with our schools. The goal is to act early. If you see a kid exhibiting warning signs, get to them early, and support them and keep them in school. If we can do that, we really believe we can get to our goal of having single digit dropout rates Tableau: What kind of insights did you find with the Early Warning System?\nSteven: We learned that transitions are critical for kids. And we've always known that, but now we're seeing the transitions and when kids are exhibiting the tipping points. For example, when kids transition up to the middle school, it can be a really difficult transition, and about 20 percent of our dropouts start showing warning signs in middle school. They start having behavior problems or start having discipline problems or their test scores start dropping. At the transition to high school, about 40 percent of our kids start exhibiting some warning signs that we'd never seen before. Some of our visualizations are helping catch kids fast and intervene. Tableau: Where do you store your data?\nSteven: We have large amounts of data and it's all over the place. We have student management systems; people have Excel spreadsheets. We get SAT data, state test data, student attendance data, teacher attendance data, everything. We have volumes of data in databases, warehouses, student management systems, and business systems. We integrated our data via SQL Server into a data warehouse and then use Tableau to visualize our data. Tableau: How do you distribute the data to users?\nSteven: We put it in a web-based tool, and then people could get to it. We've launched this to every administrator and every teacher in our school district; we have user authentication for everybody. They log on and are allowed to see the data for students that they actually work with. Once they can get there and see that cool visualization, then they really get excited and they can alter it and do things with Tableau that they couldn't do in any other product. Tableau: How has Tableau changed day-to-day work?\nSteven: Counselors and administrators have been really excited because it's brought a whole bunch of data sources together that they've never been able to see together. In the old system, it was like I would see your name, I'd click on you, I'd open it up, I'd see your data, I'd shut that down, I'd go to the next person. Teachers had to go like 30 times into 30 different kids, or if you're a secondary teacher, 150 kids. It just kind of overwhelmed you if you wanted to see particular data. So to have it all there in one location, that's been really helpful to teachers. We don't want them spending hours and hours creating Excel spreadsheets; we want them acting on the data. Our goal is to get it into their hands quickly so that they can manipulate and alter the data really fast and go do their work. Tableau: How has analytics changed the education systems?\nSteven: We're asking principals and teachers to use data unlike ever before. We're asking folks to make changes in students' test scores, in students' trajectories, get students to college. We're asking more of our school system than we've ever asked before. So it's critical that they have the data to act on, and they know exactly how they're doing and what they're able to do. Tableau has increased the efficiency of what we're able to deliver data. It\u2019s so much smarter, more effective and targeted; it allows everyone to act quicker. They used to send their data downtown. A month later, they\u2019d get this Excel spreadsheet and it was too late. They'd say, \"I'm already moved on, I needed it that week.\" Now with Tableau, we can deliver it within 24 or 48 hours. I've been able to give them tools to help them be more effective principals and teachers to get more kids to graduate, more kids to post-secondary, more kids to college."

        "content": "Tableau: How are you using Tableau at Amylin?\nRommel Fernandez, Director of Commercial Insights: We think Tableau is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Through all its statistical capabilities, Tableau gives me the ability to visually and analytically see which information I should pay attention to. I can quickly review all of our information assets to determine what we should focus on. It enables us to leverage that information, make decisions and gain insights in everything from prescription data and profile data to sales force activity. Danielle Miller, Manager of Sales Operations: From an operations perspective, sales and marketing teams aren't used to working with data, they're not data enthusiasts. So Tableau\u2019s visualizations have really helped us to bridge that conversation and help us inform those teams and help them make decisions. Tableau: How has Tableau allowed your team to work more efficiently?\nRommel: With Tableau, we can look at our information assets across the spectrum and we can optimize our resources to support not only the healthcare providers, but also the patients that they serve. Danielle: You're saving way more time working in Tableau and you're able to do so much more. The fact that you can do the table calculations, look at year over year, do moving averages all with point and click using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and it's so intuitive, means that you can get a lot more done, and actually look at lot deeper than you would previously with just say in Excel or even using other graphing functionality in say a SaaS or other types of software. Tableau: Where is your data stored?\nRommel: I use sources like MySQL and Infobright to stage a lot of my information. We have our own data warehouses, so this is my data mart. It houses sales force activity, prescription data, demographic information, even census information to look at commercial models to help us determine how we optimize and size our sales forces. In terms of size, I'm at least 100 million records in this little data mart on a secondary desktop that just sits on my desk. That's what's so great about Tableau\u2014it seems to be able to load up as much data as my laptop can handle. I can cut, slice, dice, color\u2014do all kinds of things with Tableau with millions of records or rows of data without breaking a sweat. Tableau: How has Tableau changed the way you work?\nRommel: What would have taken me five hours to do, I can do in one with Tableau. It\u2019s probably greater to be honest with you. It allows me to be more exploratory; to be able to ask questions if not this, then that. Before, I had to lead with a question and then all my time was spent answering that question, and then if it was right or wrong, then ask another question. It\u2019s just speed to answers or speed to insight, that's what has really helped me professionally and personally with Tableau.\nDanielle: Tableau puts a powerful tool in the hands of people that need to perform analytics to answer questions\u2014 and also build prototypes. With the dashboard capabilities with Tableau, we're able to build dashboards on the fly to do the exploratory analytics and determine what data is worth being looked at. Tableau: How does Tableau help you communicate insights across the organization?\nRommel: It\u2019s not only, \"how quickly can I arrive at an answer that I believe in?\" but also, \"how can I sell that to the rest of the organization?\" The analysis is just the first step. But once I've got that, I've got to tell the story. Tableau helps me explain to leadership why based off of this insight, we're making a decision that will impact the organization. And that's cross-functional in any industry that you're a part of. Tableau: Do you have an example of how visualizations helped you communicate better?\nDanielle: We used the mapping functionality in Tableau to track our sales force calls by the zip code level. Our sales force was going out there making calls every day, but had no idea when they\u2019d hit our region frequency. When you can put that in a meaningful map and show them the deficit in particular areas of doctors they may not be reaching\u2014that was an \u2018a-ha\u2019 moment where they realized we weren't trying to slap them down and say you need to make more calls, but rather \u201cHey, look at this, here's a visualization that shows how you're managing your territory and what's going on in there.\u201d Tableau: What value has Tableau brought to Amylin?\nDanielle: We have business users don't want to go through tons of data, but when you can get it in a format and create a dashboard and enable the flexibility to filter and change metrics with the parameters, then you can create dashboards that they find really useful. Tableau allows us from the analytics perspective to build dashboards based on what we feel that users will need, and it also gives them the ability to then go in and further mine down to their geographic granular level. Rommel: Speed is the biggest change\u2014because we can get through so much information to arrive at our answers or insights more quickly. Then Tableau gives us the ability to communicate effectively visually. It\u2019s also helped get rid of the fear of looking at data. Resources are tight, time is tight and data can be complex. So when trying to answer a question, there's probably a hundred ways to answer it\u2014but some of the questions that derive from those answers are just as important. Sometimes you've just got to let the data lead you instead of you leading the data. And Tableau allows you to load in as much data as possible, have fun with it and see where it takes you."

        "content": "Tableau: What made you look to Tableau for support with analytics?\nTorry Johnson, Senior Business Analyst: For us analysts, Tableau Desktop has been a great tool to work with these large data sets that we have to find insights. It's quick and it's easy. It's been a lot better than digging through raw data. And we're starting to get more and more adoption, more excitement around Tableau Server with different people within the company, which is nice for us because we spend less time building reports for them and they spend more time actually utilizing the data that we have available. Steve Brownell, Senior Data & Analytics Specialist: I generate a lot of information that other people use to try to inform our higher-level executives and people all throughout the organization so that they're enabled to make intelligent decisions with data. Torry Johnson: Ultimately we want our users to be able to use Zillow to find a home, which is the biggest purchase they'll make in their life and it's a very personal purchase. By finding ways to help make this process easier for them, we make it not so stressful to make this purchase that should be kind of a fun and exciting event. Tableau: How are Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server proving to be valuable?\nSteve: Our rentals dashboard on Tableau Server enables us to dive into states and feed providers with our rental listings and we can look for quality issues both by cross cuts across both those dimensions. We can really dive into where we have opportunities or issues with data quality and prioritize different regions to go after to acquire new listings. Torry: A lot of the data sets we work with are quite large, and Tableau gives us a way to dig into that data and kind of quickly see where it is that something interesting is happening\u2014whether there's an outlier in a certain area, or if there's a particular metric that we're looking at that's going to point us towards a big opportunity or possibly a problem with a product. Tableau: How big is your data set?\nTorry: We have data on every home in the U.S., and that's over 100 million homes\u2014so that's over 100 million rows just in that database. Steve: We've got lots of different metadata dimensions across contacts\u2014where consumers are contacting real estate agents through Zillow? Was it on a mobile app? Was it on a for-sale property? Was it a rental? Torry: We also have a mortgage product where lenders provide tens of millions of loan quotes every month to users who are trying to find the best rate on a mortgage\u2014that's hundreds of millions of rows. Just being able to crunch that data into something manageable is where Tableau really helps us. Tableau: How does Tableau help you examine that data?\nTorry: With large data sets, we're looking at a lot of things like distributions and histograms and we're looking for anything that might point out an opportunity for us to possibly generate more revenue, or create something that helps our customers in their experience shopping for homes. Steve: We can allow the product managers to basically slice all that data in Tableau Server by setting up a bunch of filters so that they can do the analysis that they want, and we just provide the data for them to make the insights. Torry: Real estate is very geographical and because Tableau has such strong mapping support, it's really super useful to us. Rather than just line charts and bar charts, we can provide more context so the business owner can be looking for patterns in geography. This is hard to do without a map. There aren't a lot of other products out there that have the built-in, drag-and-drop map interface. Tableau: What are some patterns Tableau has illuminated?\nSteve: Using this Tableau Server dashboard, we found there's a geographical discrepancy where some people label a unit as a condo, and others label it as an apartment. So we thought that we had this weird mix of units, but it actually turned out to just be geographical terminology. Once we saw that on a map, we knew how to come at the problem a little bit better. Torry: With hundreds of millions of loan quotes, some users don\u2019t get a lot of quotes for the particular loan they're looking for. By looking at the distribution of this data and how it's spread out across different loan types, we can figure out users who have particular credit score problems may not get as many loan quotes, or maybe if you want an investment property it's a little harder to find a lender who's willing to lend in the current kind of real estate environment. So we can look at all these different characteristics and see what type of response users are getting, and if they're having a good experience shopping for their loan on Zillow or not. Steve: Our economics team has published a lot of things using the Tableau Public product. One really cool one that they've done is a negative equity. So if your house is underwater, you can zoom by county or zip code and see exactly how much your county or zip code is underwater on average. You can really personalize the data as opposed to just having a national snapshot number in an article; you can zoom in and see how it affects you more realistically than just the average American. That's a lot more powerful, we think. Tableau: Are you getting a good response online with Tableau Public?\nSteve: We\u2019ve had very high engagement rates with the Tableau Public products we've put out on the Web. People really enjoy seeing how they can dial into their neighborhood and see how the market is affecting them. We've got all sorts of metrics around growth of the market and home values. People are really interested to see how their trend in a small-market area compares to other neighborhoods. Tableau: How has the use of Tableau expanded at Zillow?\nTorry: We started by using Tableau Desktop about three years ago with roughly five users primarily on the analytics team to explore these big data sets and answer questions for different people from the business. It was more just for our analysts to dig in and look for insights. Steve: It had organic growth from there as we started to disseminate that information. We'd embed it in e-mail reports and use it in presentations when running a meeting. People always asked where we got our graphs. Torry: Now it's really spread throughout the company as a tool that we all use. Tableau: How has Tableau Server impacted the way people at Zillow work?\nSteve: Tableau enables people to have more of a \"pull\" relationship than a \"push\" relationship with the data. So our small analytics team can better serve more users because we don\u2019t have to answer every question; instead we provide a framework for people to answer their own questions. Steve: It's just a great way to be able to interact with data as opposed to just receive data. That really adds another level of insight that you can gain by being able to not just be presented with something, but to be able to create something based off of a platform that's given to you. Tableau: How has Tableau Server impacted the way your analytics team works?\nTorry: About a year and a half ago, we switched to using Tableau Server so we could deliver more reports to users within the company. Steve: It frees up a lot of resources for us to be a little more nimble and create more platforms than answers. I feel like it increases my efficiency as an analyst because I can serve more people and helps us to be more nimble. Torry: Anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of my time used to be spent creating ad-hoc reports and now it's dropped dramatically. Tableau Server really helped us in the BI department not have to do so many ad-hoc reporting requests that take up a lot of time. We can push things out there. They're interactive; people can dig in; they can find what they want. And we can spend our time looking for those little nuggets of insight in the data rather than just responding to requests all the time. Steve: There tend to be some power users at Zillow who really want all this extra data. For their needs, we can surface that data up in Tableau Server. Users go to the server as a data source and pull it down\u2014they help themselves, really. Instantly, they trust it as a data source and really enjoy they can get results so quickly. Torry: If we didn't have Tableau, we would spend more of our time working one-on-one helping business people dig into data, drill down, find insights and find problems. With Tableau, they can do that in a self-serve manner and then come to us to help solve the problem rather than find it."

        "content": "Tableau: What has been the main benefit of working with Tableau at Barclays?\nPeter Gilks, Senior Insight Analyst: Tableau Server lets us engage our business users and get our data out there at a large scale. It\u2019s getting people really excited about what data can do for them. When we can show them a really, really engaging visual, a very strong dashboard\u2014 that's getting them excited to use that data to make better decisions. Tableau: Peter, what do you do as a Senior Insight Analyst?\nPeter: I look into our customers' data to try and find out who they are, what kind of products they use, and their demographics. Then I find ways that we can improve our strategy, product development, and marketing to really give our colleagues a better understanding of who our customers are. Tableau: So Tableau helps you better know your customers?\nPeter: When I started using Tableau about three years ago, I just knew that we had lots of data and our other tools weren't enabling us to get the most out of that data. I knew if we got Tableau, we\u2019d be able to look at things more quickly, like customer satisfaction, demographics, and behavioral data. Tableau: What kind of insight have you found using Tableau? Has it made an impact?\nPeter: One of our recent dashboards brings in data about the reasons people complain and who those people are\u2014the insight gained through those visuals helps us improve our customer service. Being able to see on a daily basis allows us to get to a root cause analysis of what those complaints are about. Tableau: How do executives and frontline users use Tableau?\nPeter: With Tableau Server, we send data and insight out via dashboards\u2014so our senior executives and frontline see the same data. When they spot major trends, they can start to plan for them. It\u2019s really important for our teams to be able to discover something and then show other people what they've found. It\u2019s got them excited about data in a way they haven't been before. The feedback from users has been really, really strong. They really enjoy using the dashboards and find them very engaging. They enjoy being able to interact with the data and they appreciate the strength of Tableau\u2019s visuals. Tableau: What size data are we talking about?\nPeter: Typically our data lists are at around 20 million rows of data for 20 million customers in the UK. Analysis used to require lots of SQL programming and moving data into Excel then into charts. It involved a lot of pre-thought about measures to program. You\u2019d come up with your charts later, and then there was a lengthy iterative process. Now, with Tableau it's very, very quick\u2014we get the answers much more quickly than the old way. Tableau: How quickly do you get to insight with Tableau?\nPeter: I can answer things within a business meeting at the speed we're going at now. Before Tableau, we were talking a day or two turnaround per question. Now I can sit with my laptop in a meeting and answer questions on 20 million rows of data basically on the fly, flip my laptop around and show everyone the answers. And because things are quick, you can't go too far wrong. So if you try something and it doesn't work, that's only five seconds wasted; you just start again. Tableau: Sounds like Tableau is changing the way people work at Barclays!\nPeter: The major impact Tableau is having is on the way people are thinking. Tableau is really starting to increase innovation. People felt restrained by some of the tools we had before, and Tableau is allowing them to think about things in a new way. Tableau: Tell us, has Tableau changed your own life?\nPeter: It does make our day-to-day work lives a lot easier and a lot more fun. Things that were taking me days are now taking minutes. So on one hand it's made my life a whole lot easier. On the other hand, it's increased my workload because people are asking me for more stuff, but in a positive way. Using Tableau has really created enthusiasm within me and my team about what we can do and what we can achieve. I think it's really widened our horizons about the people we can reach. Tableau: And you find that people ENJOY using Tableau?\nPeter: Tableau is fun to use and it's powerful and it provides value. It gives people something that they can get excited about using. So, rather than using tools that are challenging and just laborious to use, Tableau has changed the excitement people have toward finding answers. People want to use it. Tableau: What\u2019s next for Tableau and Barclays?\nPeter: There's a lot of latent demand that's not being met; we really want to be able to surface that through Tableau. We've just bought Tableau Server, and are going to start rolling it out. We're getting requests already for things that people want on it. We'd like to create user groups, bring in more of the business users, and build an analytics community through Tableau. We\u2019ll take it step by step."

        "content": "Tableau: ACT has a lot of data stored up. How are you using it?\nTim: We have 50+ years' worth of data. If we can create an understanding and gain insight on what is really in that data, we can advance our mission in helping people achieve education and workplace success. Tableau: How is Tableau getting you closer to insights from the data?\nTim: In the first age of analytics, we saw an early democratization of data where the financial analysts would work with data\u2014there wasn't much data at that time\u2014and apply ledger pads and graphical paper as tools to make their representations. As we evolved into more of the information age, data grew and organizations built IT departments and started to store all this data in data warehouses. The problem became how do I make it meaningful? How do I create something that's usable to drive action? And that's where Tableau is really changing the way we're able to work with our data. Tableau: How did you get started with Tableau?\nTim: ACT hired a chief innovation officer who came from health care. He had worked with Tableau in the early days in its connections with Stanford University. We went to our data warehouses and pulled a fairly small dataset\u20141.6 million rows of data\u2014and handed it over to our Tableau reps. They sat in our boardroom with our chief executives, and in front of their very eyes transformed this data into visual representations. It was instant, it was immediate. Tableau: And how did Tableau spread through the organization?\nTim: We started recruiting champions, and I was brought in to evangelize the use of Tableau and to democratize data analytics within the organization. Word started to spread, and we made it very easy for people. All they had to do was walk up to me or to someone that was working with Tableau and said, \u201cI'm interested.\u201d We sent them some instructions to engage in the learning, to bring their own data, and to experiment. We ask them to go through the tutorials, and if they find that they have a need and that can add value to the business, they can get a license. It's as simple as that. Tableau: How many people use Tableau at ACT and what do they do with it?\nTim: We've grown from the early days of five people to 120 people that are using Tableau within the organization in a wide variety of applications. The first application I attempted with Tableau was to answer questions on production performance. I'd spent three solid weeks with about 80,000 rows of data in Excel trying to understand and answer the question. When I got Tableau, 90 minutes later I was able to achieve what I could not achieve in three weeks using Excel. The visualization clearly answered the question and we were able to move on from that and answer new questions. Tableau: What\u2019s a specific example where Tableau surprised you with insight?\nTim: We had some waste going on and couldn't easily identify where it was. Our test development people pulled the data on the orders to find the gaps using Tableau\u2019s mapping function. It easily jumped out. They had circles that were coming up big and red, and they had circles that were small and they were green, and they could turn this over to the field staff to easily target those areas and save the organization significant amount of money on unused test materials. Tableau: You don\u2019t need Big Data to find Tableau useful?\nTim: There\u2019s a perception out there that data analytics tools are only useful for large datasets, but we're finding there are many uses across a diverse set of datasets for Tableau. You don't need vast amounts of data to put it to use, and I'll give you an example. There was an individual from our office of the CEO whose responsibility it was to report progress on 13 strategic initiatives. There wasn't a clear way to do it. The data was in a project management system, pretty textual, not very clear. That person came in, took a look at Tableau, did an experiment with it, took those rows of data, which there were only about 100 rows, and instantly created an image that the C level people and the CEO could tell in an instant how we were progressing on the corporate initiatives. Tableau: And you\u2019ve found Tableau easier to use than expected? Tim: Tableau was built to be easy and it is. All that you need to do is click. And we just keep clicking\u2026. If you don't make it hard, it's easy. We have a wide variety of different people using this. We\u2019ve had champions come out of our measurement research area that have PhDs in statistics that are using it. We have people that come out of our administrative support areas that use Tableau. So we can cover a wide range of people and get a wide range of wonderful results. Tableau: You find that people enjoy using Tableau?\nTim: Tableau is fun to use and it's powerful and it provides value. It gives people something that they can get excited about using. So, rather than using tools that are challenging and just laborious to use, Tableau has changed the excitement people have toward finding answers. People want to use it."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: What excites you most about Tableau?\nRishi Kumar, Director of Analytics: It\u2019s true that Tableau is a fantastic product and it gets better all the time, but really it's the promise of innovation, the promise that they're going to take us on a journey to become a much better, much more analytically-minded organization that I think is absolutely the most important, the most fantastic part about it. With their products comes the promise of innovation. Clearly they're taking a very active interest in their innovation funnel. They're listening to what customers have to say, and they're informing their innovation choices by how people are actually using the product. Tableau: How do you use Tableau at Unilever?\nRishi: Unilever is a fantastically complicated business from a global perspective. We have products in 170-plus countries. Tableau helps us look at our information and bridge the gap between the global perspective and the local perspective. It enables global managers to drill down into the level of detail that they need to in order to understand the business and make the business decisions they need to make. The beauty I think really is that you're enabling decisions that would not otherwise be available. There's a sort of higher quality of decision-making. Tableau: How does Tableau help Unilever understand its customers?\nRishi: Tableau's definitely a big enabler of really being able to understand what it is that's driving a consumer to make purchases and how those drivers are changing over time by blending all the data together. Tableau is fantastic at drilldown capability, and it's also really good at providing different perspectives. So people can group products or competitors as they see fit. The flexibility in rolling up from that granular level is also fantastic. You also get, you know, scalability, so we don't necessarily need to invest in many different IT infrastructures globally, we can invest in just the one. Tableau: How does Tableau compare to the way you did analysis before?\nRishi: The most compelling feature of Tableau to me that as somebody who's analyzing data that really changes the game is data visualization. A lot of the things that could be done with complex mathematics can be done simply with Tableau\u2019s data visualization. Instead of relying on computers and complex mathematical modeling to process information and describe those relationships, we're able to see that data and allow the human mind to process that information and understand the relationships. I really see a shift in the requirements from people who really get the mathematical side of statistics and analytics to people all around the company who just can see pictures and become more analytically minded. Tableau: What has changed since you started using Tableau?\nRishi: The first major change is that people have rekindled their interest in asking questions. Especially in a big organization where the wheels are turning and turning all the time, we have a tendency to follow process. We're not really questioning necessarily what's really happening in the situation, what's really driving it; we're just looking at the numbers and saying this is how the situation unfolded, pass the report on\u2014step B, step C, step; going through the motions. I think because Tableau puts the capability in everybody's hands to get answers to their questions, people have rekindled their interest in asking questions. We see a resurgence of that sort of interest in analysis. The second thing we see is that ability to describe complicated situations in a much simpler way, that removal of the complexity. For example, with Tableau we can easily group all the stores which have a high Hispanic population associated with them or group all the products which are fast growing products. Tableau: How did Unilever get started with Tableau?\nRishi: The Walmart team in Unilever in the U.S. is quite a data-driven team, people who know how to ask the right questions and are relying on data every day to answer those questions. The story goes they went to their IT department and asked, \u201cCan you guys bring in some tools for us to help us have better access to the data, help people with questions get answers to those questions?\u201d After trying Tableau for 10 minutes, IT knew this was a game-changing tool. Tableau was brought in on a trial period there; they reached success, and it spread quickly throughout the U.S. business. A colleague introduced it to me knowing that I really loved tools. He said, \u201cIf you're an Excel geek, you're going to be a Tableau fanatic.\u201d He was right. Tableau: Can you talk about Unilever\u2019s data architecture?\nRishi: So with the complexity of the business comes complexity of our architecture. We have a lot of companies which were equipped locally in terms of their IT infrastructure, and when those companies come into Unilever through acquisitions or other synergy programs, we have to find a way to incorporate their local technology into a global framework. I've seen more types of systems than I ever thought were possible. So it's quite a complicated landscape from a data, data acquisition and IT infrastructure standpoint. Tableau: How is the role of analytics changing over time in consumer goods?\nRishi: The consumer goods industry is quite a complicated one, so Unilever is by nature a complicated business. We participate in different categories, sell lots of different products, and there are different competitors of different natures. We've got local competitors who produce specialty products in a single market, and we've got global competitors like ourselves that produce really great products, quite frankly, across the globe. I think that more and more people are looking to data, not only to cut the complexity out of the business at a global level simply by providing a simple aggregate view, but they're also looking to understand consumer trends at a far more granular level. Tableau: Can you give us an example of the questions you answer with Tableau?\nRishi: For example, deodorant roll-ons are outperforming deodorant sprays. Why is that the case? I think it is a source of competitive advantage to really be able to understand the momentum in the business in terms of its tiny constituent parts particularly in consumer goods\u2014because ultimately it's consumers and their behavior and consumer trends that are really driving performance at an aggregate level. Tableau's role in this case is the ability to bridge that local, small, consumer-based trend to a global sort of momentum-defining trend for the business. Tableau: How has being able to blend data impacted the way you answer questions?\nRishi: One of the interesting parts about being in consumer goods is that you get a rich variety of data\u2014you get qualitative data about the sentiments of your brand, but you also get really concrete quantitative data about purchase behavior, so what people are putting into a basket through loyalty cards. You also get broader market perspectives through ACNielsen and IRI and so on. It\u2019s important Unilever is to be able to blend all this data together to understand why people are entering the shop, ultimately filling their basket with Unilever products, and determine based on those drivers what are the likely products or trends that we need to take part in as an organization. Tableau: How does Tableau help you communicate your findings?\nRishi: One of the things that comes with Tableau is definitely the ability to tell stories -- partly because the content is engaging, so people are able to see things they never saw before. They can see what our average prices were all across the globe; they can see which competitors have popped up in certain markets; that\u2019s all there. With Tableau, there's a phenomenal amount of information being displayed visually that would be almost unmanageable if it were in a PDF of numbers. So II certainly see a lot more information and a lot more interest coming through, and really it is because you're able to use these really information-rich visuals to tell stories."

        "company": "Citrix",
        "content": "Tableau: What got Citrix interested in Tableau?\nKevin Sonsky, Senior Director of Business Operations: Citrix had made a lot of investments in the back-end warehouses and cubes and data models over the years, but struggled with getting a lot of that insight of the rich data out of those architectures. We discovered Tableau could provide a lot of that rich insight through just simple plug-and-play much better than a lot of the tools we already had installed. Tableau: What sort of insights does Tableau uncover for Citrix?\nKevin: With Tableau, we get insight into information that we really struggled with before. So we're finding that we have a lot more insight into our customer behaviors and their buying patterns around the products, and what routes to market they're buying\u2014something that we've just never been able to accomplish before. Tableau: What is most compelling Tableau feature for you and for Citrix?\nKevin: The data architecture at Citrix is made up of a variety of source systems and cubes and relational databases, with tools that are generally tied one-to-one with the individual technology. So to find a tool like Tableau that is rather agnostic to the connections it can make to the various datasets was very compelling. Also, Tableau is very helpful at blending data. Users see that as a significant benefit\u2014whether it's spreadsheets that they may be managing or different source systems that haven't really been conformed yet into our architecture. Without needing IT, they can bring all that data together and blend and analyze it in ways that they weren't able to before. Tableau: So the self-service qualities of Tableau save you time?\nKevin: Tableau has been probably the most significant step we've taken towards self-service BI, which has been the number one goal of our journey since day one. Users on their own have an idea of how they want to look at data, and can turn it around very, very quickly. Speed to development is significantly faster than in the old paradigm of putting change requests in for specialists to code the reporting requirements. We also spend much less time training. It's a very intuitive tool. And so as we introduce it to users they take it on right away without extensive training. We also find that it makes us more productive in that we can prototype and deliver answers to questions that we get asked. Tableau: Can you quantify the efficiency benefits of Tableau?\nKevin: Tableau is a wow product. It just works. With no consultants, no training, it just plugs in and it works. All software should be that easy and fun to work with. Where we would have had resources spent putting together Excel workbooks or complicated data merges using spreadsheets, they're spending more time analyzing data now. There are teams that used to engage with consultants and pay for them to develop customized dashboards, coding specifically for their needs, can now just use Tableau straight out of the box and avoid some of those excess costs. Tableau: What would life be like without Tableau?\nKevin: Without Tableau, we\u2019d be making more investments in resources to do a lot of the heavy lifting that Tableau does. We would have resources developing a lot of spreadsheets, reworking a lot of answers to questions as the iterative process goes along with our management team. With Tableau, that can happen in real time."

        "content": "Tableau: What does Tableau mean to your team of clinical trial consultants?\nJeff Epstein, CEO: It\u2019s a tool that allows everybody on our team to come to work and get excited about what they do. To know that there's no limit to what our goals are to help streamline the clinical trial process and allow our clients to make more effective decisions. Jon Denne, Director of Business Development: We didn't think that there was a single product on the market that would allow us to accomplish what we needed to accomplish with one relationship. We needed a product that was gonna enable us to connect to disparate data sources. We wanted a fast visualization engine. We wanted something that was going to be flexible for the customer so that as they needed changes, we could respond to them quickly, or they could potentially make those changes themselves. Tableau absolutely accomplishes that. We were looking for a little bit of a solution, and we think we hit a home run. Tableau: How does ABLS use Tableau to help pharma clients get drugs to market faster?\nJon: In the biotech, pharma, and medical device industry, if you're not managing your process effectively, then you're not getting to market as soon as you can. There\u2019s a lot of disparate information out there. There are a lot of siloed data sources. There's also not a lot of cross-channel communication. Our goal is to help bridge those gaps and bring opportunities to the customer.\nJeff: About 25 percent of the cost to develop a drug is the enrollment of subjects in a clinical trial study. If we can decrease that time and identify some of the high-risk sites that are creating a lot of problems, then we can hopefully decrease the cost that it takes to develop the drug. Tableau: Can you give us an example of a specific way Tableau helps with clinical trials?\nJeff: When you have these rather large studies, there are many moving components, so many people trying to meet their deadlines; it\u2019s really hard to always keep a good eye on what's happening at all times. When you have a global study, you need to know what's happening in each country and having oversight of all the staff in each one of those countries or cities is vital to the efficiency of a study. The people who use Tableau are primarily the clinical study teams. They want to see how resources are being used and be able to shift things on the fly or anticipate the amount of workload needed to accommodate the study. If we can start to help our clients identify and have oversight over the development of the product, how fast enrollment is happening for new subjects, how well the product is doing on patients that are getting the product itself vs. the placebo, it allows them to identify whether or not the product is effective. If it's not effective, then they can stop it immediately. Tableau: How does working with Tableau help you decrease time to market for drug manufacturers?\nJeff: Using Tableau would decrease the amount of time it takes to get a drug to market for the mere fact that it helps the end user or the clients to make decisions on the fly. When you can make better, more active decisions on the fly and have oversight of the clinical research organizations or multiple sites that you\u2019re conducting, then it will absolutely increase the enrollment process. Jon: There are a lot of inefficiencies in a lot of the companies that are involved in the clinical trials process. A lot of different pieces that are not coordinated effectively. Our opportunity is to take analytics and sail through those channels to help people see more of a big picture of what's available to them. Tableau: What\u2019s it been like working with the folks at Tableau?\nJon: Tableau has been phenomenal in that the support has been tremendous. It's surreal. I come from a sales background where I've had multiple channel partners that we've interacted with and I keep thinking somebody pinch me, because this isn't how relationships work with traditional companies. Once we started going to some of the user groups and interacting with the community, we knew it was something unique. Whenever we have questions or problems, everybody's been fantastic. They respond quickly and they just go the extra mile to make sure that we have everything we need to represent the product the way that the product should be represented. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted you personally?\nJon: Personally, I come from a sales and marketing background and I\u2019ve seen for years how data has been manipulated without the benefit of analytics, without the benefit of really having any type of tools that will help you make better business decisions because you're looking at numbers. And numbers don\u2019t tell a story. Visualizations can tell the story and then empower you to make better business decisions. We see so much opportunity that\u2019s out there. The use of analytics in data is going to drive us to the next level. I guess I just regret that it didn't come along sooner."

        "content": "Tableau: How does Smart Media Group use Tableau?\nSarah Stone, Analyst: Anytime you see a political ad on television, someone decided exactly when and where to place it, and that somebody is us. Our bread and butter business at Smart Media is taking a client's message, figuring out exactly who the demographic is and who we're trying to reach, and then putting it in the exact right program so that they'll be able to watch it. There's a lot of research that goes into planning a media buy, a lot of front-end qualitative research to figure out the different media outlets to buy. After that, we use Tableau to track not only how much we're spending and where over time, but more importantly what our competition is doing. It's really cool to use Tableau to see our budget and the competition's budget, and look at what we're doing as far as advertising goes and what they're doing. You can really figure out who's winning the ad war where and at what point of time. Tableau: How did you start using Tableau?\nSarah: We were looking for a different way to organize and access all of our data. Prior to Tableau, we just used a bunch of different spreadsheets that were saved all over our network drive, and they all looked different, and they were all in different places, and we could never really figure out exactly what was going on as a big picture. From the moment we found the Tableau website and downloaded the trial version, we thought, \u201cOkay, we might not be computer people, but we think we can handle this.\u201d Tableau is so user-friendly that it really worked out for us. We got our data in there and started to play with it and found it incredible that we could look at broadcast spending, cable spending, radio spending for different advertisers across different years in different places, all in one place. Tableau: How has Tableau changed the way you work with your clients?\nSarah: We use Tableau every day to communicate with our clients. Whether that's having them log onto Tableau Server to interact with dashboards themselves or sending them a PDF report of a dashboard. Our clients are always looking at our Tableau reports to understand their media buys in comparison to the competition's media buys. Tableau: What's made Tableau useful as a data analysis tool this election season?\nSarah: One of the greatest things about using Tableau and using the dashboards is that our customers can get on Tableau's server at any point\u2014 it's 24/7 access. That\u2019s extremely important in the political campaign world, because people are working all sorts of hours and they always need access to the data. So Tableau Server has been really great for us to use because our clients know they can log on, check out what's happening, and interact with the dashboards.\nThe other really great thing that our clients have loved about Tableau is that, they're used to seeing reports made through Excel and they're used to seeing it a certain way. Tableau still gives us the flexibility to modify and format reports in a way they're used to seeing, but we can interact and change the data as we need to. Tableau: What has Tableau meant for you personally?\nSarah: I love Tableau and it has helped me out tremendously this election. Using Tableau has enabled me to track over a billion dollars in ad spending in 2012 alone. And if I didn't have Tableau, there's no way I could have done that. One of the greatest benefits of Tableau is that it has cut down the time of receiving information and then making actionable differences with that information. Tableau has saved me hours of time in getting reports out to clients. Before, we would get all our data together and figure out what's happening, then spend half the day formatting it to all look consistent. With Tableau, since it's all already there we can use the same dashboards, turning around this critical information faster so our clients can make decisions faster. Also, the turnaround time of our reports is less than 24 hours, always. So the ability to put new data in our database and then have Tableau refresh it automatically, and then publish it to Tableau Server or send out a PDF report has been extremely beneficial to us. It has really allowed us to quickly get information out to campaigns so that they can make different decisions. It has been so nice to know that, okay, I'm going to refresh my data and things are going to change, but the basic dashboard that I know and I trust and I know works is still going to be there, and I don't have to sit there and fiddle with it and re-format it all the time. Tableau: How reliant are you on IT with Tableau?\nSarah: As long as someone can help me set up the initial SQL database connection, I can tap in there and I'm good to go on my own as far as updating it and creating reports and working with the data that's in there. So, that has been extremely, extremely helpful. Tableau: What would life be like without Tableau?\nSarah: If we didn't have Tableau, I'd be in a mess of spreadsheets, and it would be awful. It would be so, so bad. Tableau has just really cleaned things up for us. It's made it a whole lot easier to really attack a big set of data that we didn't even know we had. It has just allowed us to organize and make reports that we would never have been able to make. So, it's just made the hugest, biggest difference for us. Tableau: How has Tableau Server been important in your deployment?\nSarah: Tableau Server has been beneficial because we can constantly update it wherever we are. It's been awesome because our clients can log in at any time to interact with their dashboards, and it gives them the ability to change the data and really extract what they want to get out of it. A lot of the times, I'll send them a dashboard and tell them what I think is important, but they'll want to have changes made or want to look at it a different way, or want to add more or subtract more. Tableau Server really gives them the power to go in there and interact with a specific set of data. Tableau: Can you give us an example of a specific insight gained from Tableau?\nSarah: In tracking the ad spending in this year, it really has been different post Citizens United. If you just take the presidential race, if you look at the two candidates, Obama and Romney, sure, they spent millions of dollars, but now that the issue groups and super PACs can also spend unlimited millions and millions of dollars, we've really seen it change. On the Republican side, Team Romney was composed of 80 percent spending from the issue groups, and then Romney spent maybe about 20 percent of that. With Obama, it was completely flip-flopped. Probably 70 percent of all Obama ads came directly from the campaign, whereas only 30 percent came from the issue groups. Tableau: What Tableau-specific benefits did you discover during the campaigns?\nSarah: Tableau really let us keep track of how many issue groups were spending on each side\u2014 it allowed us to team them up, which is something that I wouldn't have been able to do in a spreadsheet. And Tableau allowed us to look at the big picture and also break it down and see which issue groups were like contributing to the biggest piece of that pie. Tableau has really given me the ability through simple things like grouping and filtering, the ability to make more complex dashboards and to really think about and offer some good insight to our clients about what's really happening with this data and maybe how they should change their media buy because of it."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: How has Cardinal Path leveraged Tableau for your clients?\nMelaine Fuentes, Director of Strategic Services: We are a digital analytics consulting firm specializing in developing organizations to make data-driven decisions from all types of different types of data and infrastructures. Tableau has really been an innovator for analytics in its ability to take data and make it presentable in a format that transcends lines from any organization, any level of knowledge. It really enables people to understand and incorporate that data into something meaningful and strategic.\nSt\u00e9phane Hamel, Director of Strategic Services: Day in, day out, we analyze our clients' data and online behavior of visitors to their website and optimize their online presence. Tableau makes a huge difference in the value and speed and efficiency of making decisions. Tableau: Tell us about your experience as an early user of Tableau's direct connector to Google Analytics.\nMelaine: Tableau's given us a really, really great solution for blending our Google Analytics data and Omniture data with our database data. So things are in a standard DB format\u2014everything from transaction data to customer information to just even organizational information when you're making operational decisions. Now that we have a GA Connector, we can make that seamless transition between online information and offline information, that Web analytics information and that back-end information. And we can really give customers that holistic, 360 view of their organization.\nSt\u00e9phane: Tableau\u2019s Google Analytics Connector is going to be very, very useful for us because in the past, we had to use the Google Analytics API, extract the data, store it somewhere, and then point out Tableau to that new data source. Now, we\u2019ll be able to hook up directly to the API and be much more efficient in refreshing the data and getting more data easily into Tableau. That's going to save us a lot of time. Tableau: How have clients responded to Tableau?\nMelaine: Tableau Server as a solution itself makes the organization and the people that you're giving access to excited. It's something that's visual; it's something that's interactive. It gives them power and it also makes it easy for them to understand, so it's not overwhelming. St\u00e9phane: We\u2019ve seen an evolution in maturity in our clients. They start with just a Web analytics tool and then eventually they want to maybe extract some data and bring it into Excel. And then they start to integrate other sources of data, be it Twitter, Facebook, or their back-office data. But that's going to bring them so far. And when they reach that level where Excel is not enough and they really leap forward and go with something that is much more advanced and will do deeper analysis and bring much more valuable insight, that's where Tableau really comes in and brings them to the next level of analysis. Tableau: What types of insight can you drive by combining Google Analytics data with other data sources?\nSt\u00e9phane: Oftentimes in Web analytics, you see the online behavior and you see who is actually purchasing or doing the business outcomes that you're tracking. And you get the business information or the operational data in the back office. Where it becomes interesting also is to track the user from the acquisition source and track it down on the website or the digital channel\u2014be it social media, the website, whatever\u2014and track them down until the actual purchase and transaction in the back end. Once you get that, you can start to analyze those who actually purchase or did the business outcomes, but also, and maybe more interestingly, look at those who didn't do it and understand why they didn't do it, because that behavior is online and you typically don't see it in your operational systems. Tableau: What are your plans for Tableau in the future?\nSt\u00e9phane: My dream is that eventually we basically on-board our clients into Tableau and make it seamlessly part of our service so that we know from our end that we\u2019re using Tableau and we're gonna be much more efficient in the way that we provide value to our clients. Going beyond the tool and thinking in terms of business value: making the data available so that people can take business decisions on their own. Our role as consultants is to enable that. It's to enable the connectivity of the data, make it available, and make it seamless and ubiquitous so that they have access to the power and the visualizations to make their jobs easier. Tableau: What excites you most about Tableau?\nMelaine: One of the best things about being an analyst is really telling that story and making it come to life. And it's not just a static photo; it's really about the big picture. When you can really almost create a movie about one simple data point, that's exciting. And Tableau gives us that ability.\nSt\u00e9phane: One of my catch phrases is: Data is the raw material of my craft. I see my role, my job as being a craftsman. Data is the raw material and Tableau is really the tool that I'm using to turn that data into a piece of art and make it something very useful and interesting and beautiful. Tableau: How has it been working with Tableau as a partner?\nMelaine: The experience with Tableau as a partnership has been amazing. I can't say that there's ever been a time where I needed some sort of resource help and I haven't gotten it. You know, e-mails, phone calls, you name it, it's on-the-spot information and help which you don\u2019t always get from a partnership. But I have to say that the experience has been amazing. Being here at the Tableau conference has just been an inspiration. Seeing the variety of customers and the ability of what customers are doing, it just makes you feel like you can do so much more and makes you want to be better."

We\u2019re running a business and we want to bring value to our clients, we want to bring value to our organization. So, the impact is real and we measure it; it's been significant. Tableau: Why do you use Tableau to analyze market data?\nScott: We\u2019re able to perform derived analytics on hundreds, thousands of different fields, and then bring that in, visualize it, get insights, act on it, tell stories over it, in a very quick way. The objective of a tool like Tableau is to make it simple. Not simplistic but simple. We wanted to deploy this real simply for our traders and clients to determine when we might suggest they sell a security, and when they could buy it. We can filter by economic sector, security, date, and trader type. You can really very quickly get an idea of when the high probability entry or exit points are for security. Tableau: How has Tableau helped you gain insight from big data?\nScott: Tableau has opened up a whole new field for us in being able to act on insights where normally we may have had to just do sampling, we can now look at whole populations of data. We have 800 securities that we're calculating predictive analytics on to determine from a real time standpoint when to enter or exit positions. Tableau: How does that help your clients?\nScott: We are currently accurate about 80, 85 percent of the time. So, this has incredible implications for us and for our clients. The insights from, for example, how could I have implemented a trade better can yield 100-fold thousand time improvement in your cost. And in our economic environment those type of insights are incredibly valuable. We're talking about the difference between staying in business and not. Tableau: You found us early on. What drew your attention?\nScott: I've always been resourceful, and in my industry, the financial services industry, the price of entry for products can run anywhere from $25,000, $50,000, $100,000 and up. I was looking for something that I could deploy quickly and on my desktop, and I looked at a number of data vis tools back in 2006. Tableau really caught my eye as just something that was absolutely awesome. I say, in business you want to catch a wave, and I caught an early wave. Tableau: You were looking for flexibility with data sources?\nScott: Flexibility and connectivity were really things I was looking for. We deal with a lot of data, a lot of structured data, a lot of unstructured data, and in particular like time series data. And I wanted something that was flexible enough to work in text, spreadsheets, SQL databases, MySQL, a number of other variety of tools\u2014 and this was even before the big data. Tableau: How did your implementation go? How has it grown?\nScott: Since I'm one of the partners and I run IT, I really can have a lot of flexibility. I encourage my people to really stay abreast of technology and try new things. So, our implementation really started with me downloading the trial on my computer and just starting to work with it. We've deployed it across our organization with a handful of users, but primarily we're using it right now with Tableau Server internally, and externally with a few stakeholders. So, we've been pretty guarded with some of the stuff that we're deploying. Tableau: What impact has Tableau had on the organization?\nScott: Tableau has had a tremendous impact on our organization. When I originally started using it, Tableau, I really thought I had a secret weapon.The impact has been really rapid fire for us in enabling to tell a story very quickly, consume a lot of data, look at it across multiple dimensions. The impact has also been in real dollars. We've been able to export some of our insights to our clients and make serious money off of it, whether it be from a consulting project or through ongoing kind of decision-making tools. The impact is in the seven figures, so it's significant. Tableau: So it\u2019s expanded your business offerings?\nScott: It's given us a new business model. We're able to bring to market product much quicker than we would have without a team of analysts in the way. So, we're able to really flatten the layers and really build upon what we have, which is our skill and toolset, and Tableau is a core component of that. Tableau: What\u2019s next for you and Tableau?\nScott: We\u2019re using Tableau right now for real time decision support. We're really pushing the edges of Tableau. We would love to see it deployed in more of a clustering framework in the cloud. We want to start deploying this to clients in a larger way with growing graphs and things like that. What's next is wider deployment, wider consumption of the product internally and externally, and to continue to push the envelope."

        "content": "Tableau: What made you check out Tableau?\nCharles Boicey, Informatics Solutions Architect: We have spreadsheets, we have Access databases, we're on the map to a data warehouse, and we really needed a tool that could allow us to present that data to the folks within our community. I did a Google search, found Tableau and downloaded it. I found out that I could quickly attach it to a spreadsheet, and within a matter of about a half an hour come up with a real nice visualization of some quality data, push that out to some folks within the hospital, and that was it: problem solved. Tableau: So Tableau helps your organization understand all that data?\nCharles: In this day and age of trying to get the most quality for the lowest price for our patients, it's really important to look at the data and understand the best practices. Tableau has made us folks in health care be able to understand our data, and not have to wait to understand it; we can understand it today. Tableau: Getting insight quickly is important in your business, I bet.\nCharles: We're dealing with patients' lives, and it's really, really important that you know what's happening at the moment that it's happening, or a little bit before. 30 days doesn't do you a lot of good. With Tableau, we've been able to generate near real-time visualizations, which provides us the data we need to better serve our patients. Being able to bring the data and push it back to the organization so they know what's going on\u2014 in near real time\u2014they're able to take care of those problems as they come up. Tableau: What\u2019s your implementation been like?\nCharles: We needed a solution that could work within our environment now as well as work within our environment in the future, and that's what Tableau allowed us to do. It allowed us to get up and running today, not wait till the data warehouse was complete, today. So, we're able to generate visualizations from the moment that we got it. We rolled out to each department, to one or two analysts to start off with. We also purchased a Tableau Server, and that\u2019s really our BI portal for the enterprise. So at UCI. Tableau is our BI solution. Tableau: So you\u2019re providing your hospital with self-service business analytics?\nCharles: We really wanted a self-service model. The folks in IT really didn't want to be the report writers, nor should they be. From an IT perspective, we can put Tableau where it belongs, in the hands of the folks that use the data and know the data. Self-service business intelligence for us is the folks that collect the data, that know the data, that own the data, are then developing their own visualizations, their own reports, outside of the space of the IT department. It doesn't need to be in the IT department, it really doesn't. It needs to be with the folks that know the data, understand the data, and can really make visualizations and then present them to the community. And then they become the heroes within their own departments, which is really cool. Tableau: Did it require a lot of work from your IT group?\nCharles: In a health care environment, especially now with the push to implement EMRs, the bandwidth is really not there to bring in some sophisticated BI tool that you have to program, that you have to manage, you have to do all this kind of stuff with, you know, your traditional BI. But we do have the bandwidth for a tool that's very easy to use for -- for users, that we can push out in a self-service model to the -- to the various departments, teach them a little bit on how to use it, and get them up and running, and then just maintain a Tableau Server, which is very little maintenance at all. Tableau: So Tableau helps IT look good to the rest of the organization?\nCharles: You know, you can't lose here. This is a win-win for everybody. I look better and our team looks better. IT becomes superstars."

        "company": "Company name not found",
        "content": "Tableau: What made you check out Tableau?\nSheel Bhatiani, Lead Software Developer: We want to free our data. It's as simple as that. So, I took a little look, and I saw a brief demo of somebody who was using Tableau. I saw them use one worksheet and I thought, well, that's just pivot tables. Big deal, I can do that. I took a second look, and I saw the dashboard, and thought, there is something I've never seen before. I saw the action filters and that blew me away. I thought I really have to check this product out. Tableau: On what type of project did you originally use Tableau?\nSheel: One of our first applications was a customer query saying we need to build an application to manage their business. They were asking for a big development build. We thought maybe we could do it slightly differently. Rather than building a whole massive user interface and the databases behind it and all the automation and the server side components, why don't we just show you all your data? Let\u2019s put it all here in one small warehouse and we'll give you Tableau. And they loved it. They have everything at their fingertips. Tableau: And word got around about the easy-to-use new tool?\nSheel: The way our trading desks are organized, they all kind of sit near each other. And so, you know, people see what's going on and we had another request from our risk department. They were also interested in flexible reporting on top of our risk warehouse. We\u2019d already built the back-end, so the database was already there, and we'd actually started to build a little bit of a flexible reporting solution ourselves... That was when we thought, well, we should probably stop that, we just had really good experience with the Tableau, let's bring that to the game. Tableau: Did Tableau help cut down the amount of software you needed to build?\nSheel: At that point, we could get rid of all the flexible reporting we'd built on top, no need to maintain that, no need to develop that. No need to go through the cycle of users saying, \u201cOh, but wouldn't it be great if we had a control that would filter it like this\u201d or \u201cWe want to see our data that way.\u201d So, we got rid of that and put Tableau on top of it. Tableau: And your customers still get the views they need?\nSheel: The users themselves can say, \u201cOh, I want to see this a different way.\u201d Click, click, and it's there. Even if they're not quite sure how to do it, they phone us up, a few clicks later, and we turn around the call. Tableau: So you\u2019re providing self-service business intelligence?\nSheel: We'd like to make it completely self-service. But it's a real learning process for the business to realize that they can work in this way. They've never worked like that before. They're used to phoning people up and e-mailing spreadsheets around. So, it's a difficult challenge to get people thinking in this new way that \u201cHey, here's the data. Here's where you can find it. Here\u2019s a link; go and look at it yourself.\u201d Tableau: Are you finding it easy to implement?\nSheel: From the desktop point of view, it's just another client application. I look at it as an extension to Office. It sits beautifully next to Excel on your desktop. There's nothing for us to maintain there, installing an application on a desktop PC is something our desktop support team does regularly. There's no additional training required to get up and running. Tableau: How do you train people on Tableau?\nSheel: I recommend the online training. I did all the web training, which was fantastic. As new people join the company and pick up the tool, we just say it's all available online for free, go and have a look. Whenever you have time, you can pick it up in bite-sized chunks, you don't have to commit a whole day to it, pick it up as you like. Tableau: How has Tableau impacted your company?\nSheel: Our traders now while they're on the phone, while they're being quoted prices, they can look up in real time how much more of this product can they buy. We have a dashboard set up to answer that specific question. They've never been able to do that before. For our risk department, they can look at our exposures and aggregate them across all our funds in a uniform way. Our portfolio management group now has really good control over seeing all the funds that they manage in one place. And the portfolio managers can see where they are today, how much cash they have, what securities they\u2019ve bought, how they are performing over time. That is all right there, what trades have they done recently. Tableau: How do you control permissions for who can access which data?\nSheel: We're a Microsoft shop. We have Active Directory, plugs right in, and it's actually a really nice single sign-on user experience for Tableau Desktop. There are no logon screens or anything. And when people look at their dataset, because all the permissioning is coming from SQL Server, they only see the data they're entitled to within our system. Tableau: So you\u2019re pleased with the security?\nSheel: We definitely look at the security, the reliability, the scalability. These are always our primary concerns. In terms of scalability and performance, that's all taken care of on the database side, and when we look at our deployments for Tableau Desktop, it's all NT authentication, that fits perfectly into our environment. So, we can create one dashboard, publish it to the entire company, and no matter what group you're in you'll only see data that's relevant to you. You'll never see something you're not entitled to, because that is enforced at the database level. SQL Server simply will not give you that information. So, it was a really good match with our security policies, certainly on the desktop side. Tableau: Do you use Tableau for your own department?\nSheel: I use Tableau to look at what is my team doing: How many support calls are we answering? Who are they coming from? Which applications are the most expensive to support? What could we do to bring that cost down? Where is the demand coming from in terms of new developments? What does that pipeline look like? Are we serving that quick enough? What are the new projects coming up? Do we have enough resources to meet those demands over the next quarter, over the next six months, over the next year? We launch a lot of new funds all the time, and business is really picking up over the last year. So, we need to know that we have the resources available to meet that, so we don\u2019t have to say, \"well, you can't launch that fund today, because we're too busy doing this other project.\" Tableau: Any suggestions on how to create interest in Tableau internally?\nSheel: The way we approached that was to put up a series of demos, simple stuff, to just show what we can do with our existing datasets, and took that to a senior level. Those guys obviously loved it; they saw the power of what you can get out of that, and they kind of pushed the message down. Then, that way we kind of get a bit of interest from the business side coming to us and saying let's work together. They say things like, \u201cThat demo does look really cool. Oh, and can you do this and can you do that?\u201d And very quickly you've got projects off the ground."

Now with Tableau, we can bring it all together. We can really get a holistic view of our operations and address customer issues as they come up. Tableau:What has been Tableau\u2019s biggest impact at OptumHealth?\nLarry: The biggest impact Tableau has had on our organization so far is to help us understand the spaghetti junction of data and help us manage it, and present it in a meaningful way. Prior to Tableau, we had different silos of reporting teams, data sources, and separate spreadsheets. Now with Tableau we can integrate that data, provide a holistic view, and really add value to the organization; and on the flip side develop content in a fraction of the time. So, there's increased efficiency, which is a key value-add, but also the additional data insights that is really helping us drive performance of the organization. Tableau: Do you have an example of how data visualization has driven value for you?\nLarry: We had to track our various distribution partners, independent brokers. And historically we just had monster spreadsheets that were unmanageable, not very useful. We produced these spreadsheets for our sales team, but, you know, they would filter and sort, but they really weren't driving value. So, we put Tableau on top of the -- this dataset, and really provided a very useful tool for our sales force to look at their sales territory, see where the key brokers and distribution partners are, and really look for opportunities. Tableau: How has working with Tableau impacted you personally?\nLarry: I love Tableau. It makes work fun. It makes my work day more enjoyable. Instead of dealing with all these data issues, Excel spreadsheets, and Access databases, now we get to be creative. As a \u2018super analyst\u2019, we can try to understand what's the best way to present data. Before, we were asking users, \u201cWhat columns and rows do you want in your report?\u201d Now, we ask, \u201cWhat do you need to drive the business?\u201d Tableau: What\u2019s the return on investment like for OptumHealth?\nLarry: Every day we find another use case and we find more value, and it's really helping us run our business more effectively, but also service our customers more effectively. Tableau: Are you looking forward to Tableau Mobile?\nLarry: One of our key lessons learned from using Tableau: Put Tableau where the users go. So, we embed it in SharePoints, we embed on active desktops. We\u2019ve put it in PowerPoint. And now as more and more executives use the iPad, it just is another form factor that we can use to distribute and relay information. So, Tableau Mobile will allow us to publish content once, and then deliver it to our users wherever they access data. Tableau: What are the benefits of deploying Tableau?\nLarry: More insight into our customers' experience, and understanding how they interact with us with all the data that flows through our various systems. That's the real value that Tableau has provided to our organization. Tableau: Does it take long to turn people on to Tableau?\nLarry: One week after I transitioned to my new role, we had Tableau dashboards published, and the new organization was amazed by the content we would be able to create with the \u201cinstant-on\u201d of Tableau."

        "content": "Tableau: Do you think that Tableau on the iPad gives you a competitive advantage? If your counselors are out in the field trying to recruit a student, and maybe another university is also trying to recruit that student, does the ability to get data so quickly help them?\nDuey Heffelfinger, Associate Director of Admissions Operations: Yes, I think you hit the nail on the head. It\u2019s an advantage because of the speed of being able to get the information. We are able to respond to any market changes almost immediately. Students can ask some unusual questions, and we are able to answer some of those questions faster than anybody else. But what I really see with Tableau is how our counselors are able to take charge of their territories and their prospects. They\u2019re able to say, \u2018these are my best prospects and I should be calling these students now or dropping them an email.\u2019 We also have student workers assigned to each of the counselors to write letters and make calls. That\u2019s the real advantage. We also have two regional recruiters who are able to access all that data remotely. Tableau: How do you calculate the ROI of Tableau for Creighton? Is it time? Productivity? Budget?\nDuey: It so clearly gave us much more opportunity and information than what we had in the past. The return on investment is just laid out there in front of you. This year our counselors actually have access to the data on Tableau Server. It is very obvious that with tools like Tableau, our counselors are much more effective on all levels of student recruitment. They\u2019re able to drill right down and determine who our student callers call and who they themselves call. They use Tableau to do that. Tableau: What problem were you trying to solve when you first got involved with Tableau?\nDuey: We were trying to analyze our data and figure out where good markets might be for prospective students. We also wanted to do some tracking of how well our counselors were doing related to their goals. We provide a host of analytic data to our president and to our board related to applications and admittance and enrolling students. We also compare ourselves to other schools that our admitted students select. We\u2019re watching our competitors\u2013 if they\u2019re the same or if they\u2019re changing. We want to know what the price tolerance is and many other issues related to the admission process. Tableau: How were you getting information from all of this data before Tableau?\nDuey: That was the interesting challenge. Our current process for admissions is based off of SQL servers, a product called R+. You can export data into Microsoft Access and write reports in Access to get to some of this data. One of the problems with that is that we don\u2019t have a data warehouse here, so sometimes there are some small consistency issues and you\u2019re trying to determine if things changed from one year to the next. So it was a larger relational system that was difficult in a way to really get at everything we wanted to get at. Tableau: How did bringing that data into Tableau help solve your problems?\nDuey: For starters, it\u2019s much more visual. It\u2019s kind of going from the\nreporting process to an analytic process. With Tableau, we were able to establish worksheets that showed us our admission funnel. It\u2019s basically a bar chart that starts from the process of inquiry, and then the student applies, and admits, and so on and so forth through the process.\nYou can run that in a report, but it\u2019s not visually appealing and you can\u2019t filter on it. So if I wanted a report of overall and I wanted a report of every counselor and how they were doing in their admission funnel, I\u2019d have to write a ten or twenty page report. With the Tableau worksheets, we could just start filtering by counselor. And then you get into the next question, which is, How are the colleges doing? How\u2019s the college of business doing? We could filter and get some answers. I suppose you could look through a stack of reports, but this was a much more convenient and efficient method of getting at that data. Tableau: Can you give an example of an \u201caha moment\u201d that came out of seeing all this data visually?\nDuey: Before Tableau, getting access to that data was simply not quick or convenient. For example, we\u2019re recruiting approximately 950 to 1,000 freshmen each year. But at the end of April a couple of years ago, prior to Tableau, there was a discovery that we were running behind. Where are we running behind? How do we get to the end? We were trying to figure it out. With Tableau, we monitor on a much more active basis. Now, in November, I already know that I\u2019m down in applications in Minnesota. I know that now instead of in April when you really can\u2019t do anything about it. We\u2019re able to really pinpoint. It could be by college. It could be the state. It could be a whole host of things that we\u2019re able to drill down and say this is where we seem to be having an issue and we can address that issue. It\u2019s much more specific than just saying our numbers are up or our numbers are down.\nSo I think the \u201caha moment\u201d with Tableau really came with the ability to be monitoring this mountain of data at a very precise level on a very regular basis. And comparing that to a couple of years ago when we were trying to reach that class size that we wanted to reach. Before, we didn\u2019t really know until the end. Maybe we gave away a little more financial aid to make sure we got that class, but we might have given some aid that we didn\u2019t necessarily need to. We didn\u2019t have a strong way of saying, here\u2019s the pocket of people that we really need to get involved and get to the next level to enroll. Tableau: So, your admissions counselors are able to go into Tableau Server and work with the data themselves?\nDuey: Yes. For example, when a counselor goes to a high school here in Omaha, they can actually look on Tableau Server and see who are the students who have inquired from this school? Who should be coming to see me? They can do it themselves. Tableau: What\u2019s another example of analytics you\u2019re doing about admissions?\nDuey: Our ACT quartiles analysis is used by our staff to monitor the quality of our class by ACT and ensure we are enrolling the proper students. We have this type of box plot for SAT, subscores and High School GPA. I particularly like this analytic as we took the standard Box Plot of descriptive statistics and added our own twists. We call this a \u201cBubble Box Plot\u201d because in addition to the standard box plot we replaced the line between the whiskers with sized circles to represent the distribution of students by score. We also include a reference line of the mean as well. Another analysis we do is a win-loss analysis. This shows our win loss percentage by type of school. The \u201cCreighton Blue\u201d bubble represents the number of times a student enrolled at Creighton (Win) over a competitor school when a student applied at both institutions. The orange bubble represents the number of times the student enrolled at the competitor (Loss). This analytic is used to better determine who our competitors are and to assist in making decisions to improve our \u201cWins\u201d over our competitors. Tableau: How much more frequently are you reporting now with Tableau?\nDuey: We update our data now on a daily basis. Before we were running a visit report maybe once a month. So we\u2019re basically utilizing live data on an everyday basis. And the key is not only to have access to that data on a regular basis, but to have access in a way that you want to use it or see it. For example, I may be a counselor in Chicago, and I really only care about my piece of the pie. I want to look at my Chicago data. Tableau: And you\u2019re also able to get at data you didn\u2019t see before?\nDuey: Yes, a prime example is that in previous years was we couldn\u2019t really figure out who our completed applications were without some real challenges. And now because we\u2019re doing some new things to load our data into Tableau Server, we\u2019re actually able to get some of those pieces that we really want. Tableau: How many people do you have using Tableau?\nDuey: We have about 20 licenses on Tableau Server and four Tableau Desktop licenses in the admissions office. Tableau: How are you using Tableau on the iPad?\nDuey: About half of our admissions counselors have iPads. They use them for all kinds of different things, including taking videos and pictures of campus. They use those in high school visits and college fairs, right down to how do I get to a school or mapping features and so on. Our iPad users have just been trained to download the Tableau App and utilize Tableau Server from their iPads. Tableau: Have you heard any reports yet from people using it in the field?\nDuey: I\u2019ve used it. The feature that I like the most is being able to highlight the filter, make the filter edits, and then have it automatically update.\nThe counselors have just started using it. It\u2019s so similar to Tableau Server, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to tell me much except that they love the fact that it\u2019s mobile. They don\u2019t have to carry their laptops around. From what I\u2019ve seen, most of the features are very similar to Tableau Server. In fact, I personally think it\u2019s easier to use than the web version, primarily because of the way the filters work. Tableau: So, your counselors on the road will be accessing the same kinds of information they would have been accessing from their laptops. It\u2019s just easier now.\nDuey: Right. It\u2019s all directly connected to the Tableau Server software. It\u2019s more the mobility of it and the convenience of it. Tableau: Great. Having been through this process, what would you recommend to another educational institution that was considering Tableau?\nDuey: The big advantage we have had is the ability to get the data cleaned, so we can utilize it in a very strong way. I think that one of the reasons that past efforts struggled with using Access or other tools is that the data wasn\u2019t in a convenient, accessible format. So as you bring Tableau on, as with any other tool like this, you probably need to have access to someone who knows and understands who, what, where, why and when the data is there. I would guess some people love the tool, but they may not really understand what their data looks like and what\u2019s really there."

        "content": "When you\u2019re an organization committed to saving lives, the more you remove waste from systems and processes the more resources become available to put towards patient care. Seattle Children\u2019s\u2014the 6th highest ranked children\u2019s hospital in 2013 according to U.S. News & World Report\u2014discovered ways to \u201cvirtually increase beds\u201d and treat more patients. More People Turning Data into Insight, More Quickly\n\u201dWe are continuously looking for new ways to improve our quality, safety, and processes from the time a patient is admitted to the time they\u2019re discharged,\u201d says Drexel DeFord, Senior Vice-President and Chief Information Officer at Seattle Children\u2019s. \u201cSo we spend a lot of time analyzing data associated with those visits.\u201d To more quickly turn patient and hospital data into insight, Seattle Children\u2019s implemented Tableau Software\u2019s business intelligence application. Tableau fundamentally changed what Seattle Children\u2019s could do with data by providing browser-based, easy-to-use analytics to stakeholders throughout the organization, making it intuitive for individuals to create visualizations to understand what the data means. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing Data Analysts, Business Managers, and Financial Analysts as well as Clinicians, Doctors, and Researchers all using Tableau in different ways to solve different problems in ways that we couldn\u2019t do on our own before, largely because we didn\u2019t have enough time or enough people,\u201d explains Ted Corbett, Director of Knowledge Management at Seattle Children\u2019s. \u201cWith Tableau, more of our staff are able to develop visual systems on their own resulting in dashboards and scorecards which really help us define what the standard is, how are we achieving against it, and how are we growing into the future.\u201d Jason Jio, Seattle Children\u2019s Administrative Director of Surgical Services explains, \u201cIn the past, we spent days, sometimes weeks developing something as simple as a patient volume-based dashboard. With Tableau, we\u2019ve converted that to monthly dashboards and are looking at daily dashboards to improve day-to-day decision making.\u201d Shorter Wait Times Means Higher Through-put\nThe Surgical Services team at Seattle Children\u2019s started using Tableau to see if they could measure patient wait times. What they discovered were steps they could take to reduce wait times and increase the number of patients served at the hospital. \u201cWe were able to set up a fantastic visualization that showed some of the root causes and contributing factors for patient waiting,\u201d explains Jio. \u201cFor example, we looked at some of our rooming practices and saw that delays early in the day cascaded to the rest of the day. It became very effective for us to really focus on on-time starts, and we\u2019ve already seen significant improvement in patient waiting overall.\u201d \u201cWe have to continue to be able to treat as many kids as possible,\u201d explains DeFord. \u201cBy making those processes more efficient, for all intents and purposes we created more beds, even though we didn\u2019t physically build them.\u201d Read more about how Seattle Children\u2019s is getting the most out its data to make an impact."

        "content": "Tableau: So you\u2019ve had some very interesting years at Swedbank.\nWade: I have. I started work at Swedbank in 2003 in the Baltics, based out of Tallinn, Estonia. I worked in risk management for a few years and ended up becoming the Chief Financial Officer of Swedbank Estonia for the boom years of 2004 to 2007. The management changed in 2008 when the depths of the financial crisis really started becoming apparent in the Baltics, and at that point I became the head of the Baltic Credit Risk Analysis for 2009. Tableau: When did you first find out about Tableau? What specific problems were you trying to address? Wade: It was April of 2005. I had been doing presentations for the Estonian management team, comparing how each of our different business lines was doing. I needed to do a lot of small multiples, panel charts. I\u2019d been devouring the web to find out ways to do panel charts, and I was doing some very creaky and cantankerous ones in Excel, inspired by a man named Kelly Day, who was doing a blog called \u201cProcess Trends.\u201d But in April 2005, I stumbled upon Stephen Few. I found a newsletter article that he had written about this great new software he\u2019d been playing about with. I started using Tableau and have not stopped using it since. Tableau: How is Tableau different from tools you\u2019ve used in the past? Wade: Tableau is simple. It\u2019s fast. It\u2019s intuitive. I totally love and appreciate the level of interactivity that it brings to any conversation. One of the great things I have now in my office in Sweden is my table. Sweden is very into ergonomic tables. Most of the time, my table is up because when people come to talk to me, Tableau is the third member of the conversation. Tableau: Tell me about those conversations. How are you using Tableau?\nWade: It can be any number of ways. I\u2019ve made a habit of keeping a number of Excel files in a desktop folder \u2013 everything from macro statistics to what\u2019s happening in our cost base and why is our net interest income diving? Generally I\u2019ll have Tableau running in the background. Someone will come in with one question, and all of a sudden I can link and blend data from different Excel files in our database. What started off as a simple question generally ends up with me and my conversation partner discovering some new insight about an unrelated topic that we had not even thought about before the conversation started. The secretaries tell me that the coffee consumption in my corner is much higher than anywhere else on our floor. Tableau: How many people at Swedbank use Tableau?\nWade: Not enough! Right now we probably have about eight users spread throughout both the Baltics and Sweden. We\u2019ve been very much in guerrilla mode. I\u2019ve managed to get traction within the analyst community because as soon as someone bright, young, and energetic finds Tableau and discovers the power, they\u2019ll never give it up or allow it to be traded for anything else. Still, one of the challenges we face is increasing the use of Tableau within our company. As I mentioned, I worked in the Baltics before, and now I\u2019m working in Sweden. These are the two big territories of Swedbank. One of the challenges we have is that we have different data warehouses in each geography, as well as different business intelligence software platforms. So we\u2019re trying to position Tableau as the solution, or the third alternative, for both. A number of conversations I\u2019ve had have been with analysts saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been ordered to make a visualization that looks like the one the CEO saw two weeks ago.\u201d The Tableau visualizations have started to creep out within the company, and that\u2019s when the real traction starts happening. As soon as analysts see someone else showing how to drag and drop, as soon as they grab control of the mouse, Tableau usage will skyrocket. Tableau: What have you found to be the major benefits of using Tableau? Wade: The major benefit is the speed of actually delivering the visualization. Most of us in the analyst community, we don\u2019t have the luxury of just sitting and freethinking all day. We actually have to deliver presentations. We have to deliver reports. With Tableau, you can do things so much faster than with any conventional software like PowerPoint or even Excel. Another great benefit is the interactivity Tableau brings to the conversation. For most of the last decade, as a CFO and head of a group unit within Swedbank, sometimes up to half my time is standing in front of audiences with a big, long stream of PowerPoint slides rolling in the background. I\u2019m delivering the same message, or relatively the same message, that I\u2019ve delivered a dozen times before. With Tableau, all of those presentations suddenly become interactive. The audience can participate, especially in an informal work environment. If someone has a question, you can answer that question with Tableau. You can bring in the data from elsewhere. You can throw up a time series that was not on the screen before. What used to be a series of 10 boring presentations becomes 10 conversations about the problems that business really has. Tableau: Can you tell me about any significant \u201caha\u201d moments you\u2019ve had using Tableau?\nWade: In one of my fist times ever using Tableau, we were looking at the performance of one of our equity funds. I was working as a risk manager in Estonia, and we had an equity fund there that was focused on one geographic area. As a risk manager, you\u2019re paid to be very skeptical about the performance of any fund manager. Fund managers think they can always beat the market, but anyone who\u2019s read any of Nassim Taleb\u2019s work \u2013 Fooled By Randomness, for example \u2013 knows that the market can never be beaten. The fund had just reached the number one ranking in the world for its category with one of the worldwide rating agencies. But with a little drag-and-dropping in Tableau, two things popped out. First, the entire elevation in stature on the worldwide ranking was due to one bet, a single privatization voucher in Bulgaria, along about the time Bulgaria privatized its Telecom company. Most fund managers don\u2019t like to have it rubbed in their face that their performance is due to one single bet. Usually they want to be seen as making multiple great investments over time. The second thing about that, which was even more alarming, was that with Tableau I discovered that during that short time period the fund was not actually in compliance with one of the European Union\u2019s statutes. Needless to say, when that came out, the fund was brought back into compliance quite quickly. Tableau: If you were talking to an analyst at another bank, and they were looking to implement Tableau on a project, what advice would you give them?\nWade: First, I would say secure executive sponsorship early. That\u2019s probably one of the mistakes I made. I started playing around with Tableau because it was really cool, but I missed a window of opportunity when our Baltic unit bought a very intensive, all-encompassing business intelligence solution. If I had managed to get some executive sponsors earlier and show them what a server solution could do, I think we\u2019d probably have Tableau as a core business intelligence software within the group today. The second thing is that you need to really inspire a core user group of analysts. When I started using Tableau, it was fun for me. It was a way to do certain charts quickly that I wanted to use in my presentations. But what I did not do was leverage our analyst community fast enough. In a large organization, there are going to be dozens of people who are looking at cost accounting issues, who are doing forecasting, who are making the PowerPoint presentations different business managers use. The volume of information coming out of these dozen-odd analysts in any company is extraordinary. If one slide of Tableau graphs started spreading through the network of analysts, all of a sudden the demand from the executives \u2013 the people who actually make the decisions on purchases \u2013 would be so much more intense. One of the key things I\u2019m doing now is to try to nurture and keep that analyst community of Tableau users alive within the group."

        "content": "Tableau: How did you discover Tableau?\nLee Feinberg, Sr. Manager of Decision Planning and Visualizations: Actually, I\u2019ve known about Tableau since about 2005. I was working for a consulting company and looking for a way to get out of using PowerPoint and Excel. I came across Tableau just through constantly searching on the Internet for something better. Tableau: What was the process of rolling out Tableau at Nokia?\nLee: We started pretty small with a couple of Desktop licenses just to prove to ourselves that it was something useful that could have a future in the company. Then we started rolling it out to a few more people, and eventually it got to the level where we wanted to implement Tableau Server. So, we put that in as well and again started with a handful of users to show the performance. Then we grew on top of it. Tableau: What kind of data are you looking at?\nLee: Some of it is user data, about how customers use our products and our services. Some is data about surveys that we take across our user base. We have panels, so we use it to understand where we should be going with our products. It\u2019s a really wide range of information. Tableau: Have you been able to quantify the time or cost savings with Tableau?\nLee: We haven\u2019t really been able to quantify it yet. I would say the biggest change is that people are actually thinking about, \u201cHow do I do something different in the company?\u201d They\u2019re considering Tableau as a tool to change how they work. They realize that now they don\u2019t have to rely necessarily on some of our other tools that we still use. They\u2019re great too, but Tableau is an option where they can do things in a new way. Tableau: So how is Nokia doing things differently with Tableau?\nLee: I think the key is that people who have their own sets of data are able to take that and do their own analysis. The data is not all locked up in a database. Before, they either didn\u2019t have the data available at all, or they had to use Excel or PowerPoint to do the analysis. It\u2019s pretty clear that using Tableau is a really fast way to get through large amounts of data. Tableau: What kind of feedback are you hearing from users?\nLee: You hear people frequently say, \u201cI want this report that I used to have in Tableau,\u201d but they don\u2019t necessarily know what that means. They just know they want it in Tableau now because they\u2019ve seen the work that other people have done with Tableau. In some ways, it\u2019s speaking for itself in the quality of the work that\u2019s produced.\nPeople that have been using it more for analysis than just for traditional reporting are starting to see some of those benefits. They\u2019re able to get information out into their teams a lot faster than they may have been able to do before. Tableau: What kind of \u201caha\u201d moments or new insights have you had using Tableau for analysis?\nLee: I\u2019d say almost every week we see something unexpected going on from a couple of different perspectives. One is just the data itself. We have so much data. We\u2019re able to see through Tableau when there might be something happening in the data that we didn\u2019t expect, just in the overall data set.\nThen when we get into the analysis phase, it\u2019s easier for us to see trends, whether it\u2019s with our devices or with our services group or in a certain country. We see behavior, for example, where we may have a lot of users coming in from a marketing campaign, and then we\u2019re able to see trends about how long those users stay with us and interact with us. If you can figure it out once you get a customer how to keep that customer, that\u2019s really important to the business. Tableau: Tell me a bit about your data environment.\nLee: We have lots of different systems that are connected, and some people use Excel as their database. We have Teradata, and we also have Oracle and many others in the company. Tableau: Do you use Tableau against all those different systems, or is there a primary way you use it?\nLee: We mostly use it for larger data sets. We use the extract capability. We\u2019re not going live to the data because there\u2019s just so much. And it also doesn\u2019t change frequently, so we don\u2019t need to be connected live. But we make great use of the extract capability. Tableau: Do you ever work with two different data sources in the same workbook?\nLee: Yes, we do. We have some instances where there\u2019s data coming out of one of our main databases, and we\u2019ve supplemented with Excel files to create some mappings of some custom data. That\u2019s really been very easy because we didn\u2019t have to go back to the system developers and ask them to create one field for us. So it was a really easy way to move the project ahead. Tableau: What kind of best practices would you recommend to another company that was looking to manage a lot of analytics with large data, like you\u2019ve been doing with Tableau?\nLee: I\u2019d say in the long run, even though we started small, you have to partner up with your IT group if you really want to grow it. The earlier you can sit down with them and tell them what you\u2019re thinking about, and have them experience Tableau, the better.\nThere are so many solutions out there. If it\u2019s a large company, they likely have several other existing implementations already. There\u2019s always the question of \u201cwhy is this one different?\u201d I think you really just have to experience it. You can\u2019t do it by putting check boxes on a paper and trying to do a comparison that way. I think Tableau changes the game. Also, in terms of how do you get people to actually use it, I would say go fast. Don\u2019t spend lots of time in meetings and planning the way you would go through your normal business intelligence processes. Take a very small project, use Tableau, and get something out that people can start using. Then they\u2019ll see that it\u2019s different. Tableau: That\u2019s great advice. Do you have any final thoughts?\nLee: I\u2019d just say that the key, especially in a large company, is to prove it first in a small way. Then go and find somebody who has a need that you can help them fix. It\u2019s not your traditional BI route. It\u2019s really about finding that internal customer who has a problem, and you can show them how to fix it.\nThat was our key to success. We had one executive who was just wowed by the possibility, and he said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you the money to go and start building this out.\u201d Once he did, that was the start of our success.

For more information, please visit www.TheBloorGroup.com and www.TheVirtualCircle.com.   Before Tableau, Nokia relied on IT intermediaries for reports and data analysis, but the power is now in the users hands. \"It's letting the analyst do more the analysis himself or herself without IT coming between them and their data.\" Ravi Bandaru, Nokia's Product Manager for Advanced Data Visualizations and Data Analytics, has been using Tableau since July, 2010. Within his organization, he said about 350 to 400 people use Tableau \u2013 either in desktop or interactive form \u2013 and that it has brought people together. \"Earlier, people were scared of using existing BI tools to discover data, so they were relying on intermediaries, the IT guys, to bring the data to them,\" he said. He noted that Tableau's in-memory capabilities basically offer two benefits: they provide a do-it yourself interface, and they increase the speed of query performance. \"It's letting the analyst do more analysis himself or herself without IT coming between them and their data,\" he said. \"Using this kind of in-memory capability, I do see this being useful in exploring more complex and largish data sets, which were inaccessible before.\" Nokia uses Tableau for marketing analysis, and they layer Tableau on top of their own database. Bandaru said that normally running live queries against their database does not give the kind of response times that they need, but running live queries against Tableau's data engine provides the type of instant responses they expect and can work with. He said that it is useful for ad hoc analysis and that most analysts refresh their data on a weekly basis. Bandaru said he sometimes recommends Tableau for certain users, and other times they come to him wanting to use it. The typical end user he deals with is not versed in analytics, statistics or SQL. Said Bandaru, \"If the end user is currently data savvy or analytics savvy, he loves using Tableau because it's providing him access to lots of data sources now.\" But a less sophisticated user might just use it as another BI tool, and it's up to management to provide more education to explain that \"you can actually leverage this to do these kinds of complex things which are impossible while using the rest of the tools.\" Nokia is currently leveraging Tableau Version 6/6.1, and Bandaru said he expects some\nimprovements in 7.0, such as sharing extracts across workbooks, allowing the extract to work as a data source, and having these extract be available to multiple users across the globe. He said this type of streamlined collaboration would be particularly useful for a new employee who is not yet familiar with company operations. Today, he said, the problem is that they always have to go to the original data source, but he said a future benefit would be to have that employee able to extract and leverage data that has been created by any department, anywhere. Bandaru said he tries to ensure product adoption by offering in-house collaboration tools, such as Wikis, training sessions, documents, and best practices. This user experience of Tableau Version 6 illustrates the movement of Tableau from being a BI tool in the traditional sense, to becoming a BI platform that can take responsibility for a large amount of the BI needs of any organization. Technically, the difference is in the architecture. Direct-connect leverages existing highly performant data sources. And the in-memory data engine drives the possibilities. The efficient caching and processing capabilities mean that data sets do not need even need to be fully loaded into memory before analysis commences. But the user is unlikely to know or even care about that. It's speed and scope that they notice. Analysis can be performed at the speed of thought, leveraging more data on less hardware. This is true ad hoc analysis where the user does not have to determine in advance which measures to aggregate or query. The user can explore the data in every one of its dimensions, digging down into detail or summarizing into categories. Almost every form of data visualization is there,available at speed of thought and capable of processing very large data sets.

Kaleida Health has millions of patient records and needed a business intelligence tool that couple handle it all, quickly and painlessly. They chose Tableau to get the power of data analysis into the user's hands. They are able to quickly analyze among other things, resources, patients with high emergency room visits and the healthcare market in general to stay competitive. \"It's endless, the types of things we can look at,\" said Jennifer Kuebler, Corporate Analyst at Kaleida. \"I could go on forever about this product. It's made my life a whole lot easier.\" Kaleida Health is the largest health care provider in Western New York. With 10,000 employees, five hospitals, a number or clinics and nursing homes, and a visiting nurse association \u2013 not to mention millions of patient records. Kaleida needed a BI tool that could handle large data sets quickly and painlessly. Kaleida found traditional reporting tools inadequate to handle its requirements. Driven by the need for a deeper analytic capability, Kaleida created a corporate analysis department around Tableau. Instead of simply pushing out mass reports, Kaleida's BI department wanted a team that could give users what they wanted: reports they could understand. Jennifer Keubler, Corporate Analyst with Kaleida, said although their data warehouse is robust, Oracle Reporting proved to be clunky and unfriendly. \"We had nurses and non-financial people, and people that didn't really understand reporting and visualization, trying to interpret these reports.\" The result, she said, left much to be desired. Users often didn't notice the data that should have stood out. \"We created the corporate analysis department to work closely with the managers and senior executives on different projects they were doing, to not only pull the data for them, but also look at it, present it, and dig deep into the details, and find things that they should be looking at, and then highlight them in PDF files or PowerPoint presentations using Tableau,\" said Kuebler. Kuebler said she spends 95 percent of her day \u2013 and runs all of her calculations \u2013 in Tableau, primarily pulling data from Oracle databases into Excel first. For monthly analytics, she extracts data directly into Tableau from the data warehouse and is able to save and re-run queries, which is a huge time-saver when dealing with millions of records, with 40+ fields per record. Speaking of the previous version of Tableau she noted, \"I was always able to use, to pull in, as many records as I wanted, but it just ran so incredibly slow that I'd do things in pieces rather than all at once,\" she said. The new version eliminated that problem. \"Instead of having to re-run everything, it's just a couple clicks. A lot of other people will just run high level reports or summaries and they can't really dig into the details, whereas I start at the detail level then create the summaries. So if somebody wants somethings different, I already have a file with all the details. It's just a matter of moving things around.\" Besides speed, another feature of Tableau 6.0 is the ability to link different tables. Kuebler said she uses this function to merge files to an Excel table or link them to different extracts. One example is if she has an extract by zip code, but wants to look at data by county. \"If I don't have county in my file, I have an Excel file that links all the ZIP codes to a county, so I can just link it to that, and the run information by county.\" Kuebler's team was asked to look at the emergency room and the patients who visit it more than ten times a year. The data revealed that there was a problem among the Medicaid population: they were frequently using ER and ambulance services inappropriately for stomachaches, headaches, fever. \"It kind of spiraled and spiraled, and the next thing you know, it was a local news story, using the data that we pulled from Tableau,\" said Kuebler. \"And when they did the news story, they made it sound like there was this great research project and the team digging for months. And it was really just a one-day project.\" Kuebler also uses Tableau to manage resource utilizations: who's using what supplies and how much those supplies cost. This ultimately leads to efficiency and standardization across the system, something she said could previously not be done internally. \"It's fairly easy to do using Tableau and working with managers and doctors, and this is something that prior to us instituting our BI department, we'd have to contract out with health care consultants, to take a look at this stuff and pull our data.\" Just like any competitive enterprise, a health care system also needs to gauge the marketplace. Kaleida uses Tableau to compare itself to other hospitals across the country, looking at the length of patient stay, hospital practices, market share and partnerships with doctors. \"It's endless, the types of things we can look at,\" said Kuebler. \"I could go on forever about this product. It's made my life a whole lot easier.\" These user experiences of Tableau Version 6 illustrate the movement of Tableau from being a BI tool in the traditional sense, to becoming a BI platform that can take responsibility for a large amount of the BI needs of any organization. Technically, the difference is in the architecture. Directconnect leverages existing highly performant data sources. And the in-memory data engine drives the possibilities. The efficient caching and processing capabilities mean that data sets do not need even need to be fully loaded into memory before analysis commences. But the user is unlikely to know or even care about that. It's speed and scope that they notice. Analysis can be performed at the speed of thought, leveraging more data on less hardware. This is true ad hoc analysis where the user does not have to determine in advance which measures to aggregate or query. The user can explore the data in every one of its dimensions, digging down into detail or summarizing into categories. Almost every form of data visualization is there, available at speed of thought and capable of processing very large data sets."

Co-owner Richard Leeke specializes in performance testing and performance engineering of IT systems. See how and why he uses Tableau.\"\n} Equinox IT is an independent IT consulting company in New Zealand. Founded in 1995, the Equinox provides a wide range of IT services to small and medium-sized business customers. Co-owner Richard Leeke specializes in performance testing and performance engineering. Tableau talked with Richard at the 2010 Tableau Customer Conference. \u201cThe speed of being able to do ad hoc analysis is just phenomenal,\u201d he said of the Tableau data engine. \u201cIt makes it viable to collaborate.\u201d Richard Leeke, Co-owner  \n  Tableau:\nWhat kinds of problems are you trying to solve with Tableau? Richard:\nI use Tableau for almost everything I touch. Mostly, I'm analyzing performance metrics around customer's IT systems. We work on helping customers to ensure that their IT systems work fast enough, and that generates heaps and heaps of data in myriad formats. It's all about pulling that data into a form where we can analyze it and get to the bottom of a problem, and as soon as we get to the bottom of a problem we move on. It's not long-term analysis where we're refining and refining. The biggest project I've been working on since we started with Tableau is analyzing the performance metrics around a 3G mobile phone network that's being rolled out by my customer. We're looking at the impact of the new patterns of usage on their IT systems due to this new technology and the network.  \n  Tableau:\nWhat kinds of data are you working with, and what's the size of the data? Richard:\nMost of it is interactions with the network and the back end systems, like the billing system, having to do with 3G data usage \u2013 everything going onto the internet from your smart phone. Typically, we get a few million interactions a day. I've got aggregate data dating back for a year and typically work on data sets of millions.  \n  Tableau:\nWhat kind of query speeds have you seen with the Tableau Data Engine? Richard:\nThe biggest data sets I've worked on have been about 10 million, and the query speed is incredibly good. It's only a couple of seconds. In my session earlier, I talked about the very first visualization that I did when I got the data engine. The analysis that I happened to be working on at the time, when the first technology preview of the data engine became available, was something involving a few million records worth of data. My coworker Paul and I had been trying to get to the bottom of a difficult problem for about a week, and using Tableau 5 the visualizations were taking 20 minutes to redraw every time I moved something onto another shelf, which meant I couldn't keep my train of thought. Paul didn't work on the same floor. If he happened to be walking past my desk, he'd stop, we'd try to remember where we were, do another bit of analysis, and see the hourglass. Then he'd go off to a meeting, and I'd do something else.\nThe day I got the first release of the data engine, I refreshed my data extract, switched off to do something else, and suddenly I looked up to find that not only had the data extract refreshed, but the visualization was drawn. It was a feeling of disbelief. A visualization that used to take 20 minutes was drawing in a couple of seconds.\nThe next day Paul was walking past and I called him over. We set to on the same problem, and immediately he could see how quickly we could draw down. He pulled up a chair, sat down, and within 5 or 10 minutes we got to the root of this problem that we'd been chasing for a week.  \n  Tableau:\nIn your presentation, you also talked about a number of \u201caha\u201d moments in looking at the way mobile handsets were sucking down data on your customer's 3G network. Can you talk a bit about that analysis? Richard:\nOne of the things you look at in the performance of a system is how the interactions are distributed in time. Spiky load, if you get lots of requests at the exact same moment in time, that's the classic reason for failure or problems in the back end systems. With Tableau, we were able to visualize time distribution down to the second of the requests, and this highlighted very quickly that one particular make of handset was requesting email and synchronizing email at exactly the same time \u2013 which was causing a factor of 10 increase in the load versus the normal background load.\nAnalyzing that data in a more conventional way where you might say average it per a minute or an hour, you wouldn't see that effect at all. But being able to draw right down to the fine grain detail, the behavior just leapt out of the page.  \n  Tableau:\nCan you compare Tableau with other tools you've worked with in the past, particularly when it comes to working with large data sets and doing ad hoc analysis? Richard:\nCertainly the speed of being able to do ad hoc analysis is just phenomenal. It makes it viable to collaborate on that sort of analysis. In the performance engineering space, I'm often working on a large, complex integrated system which has multiple vendors involved. Typically when there are issues, all the vendors move into the mode of defending themselves and suggesting the problem might be emanating from somewhere else \u2013 whether they're directly pointing the finger or just saying it's not their issue. I like to treat diagnosis as a team sport. I try to get everyone working together in a collaborative mode. If you can get everyone looking at the same data and throwing in ideas, then maybe you've got a specialist in the networking area, and a database specialist, and someone else in the infrastructure, and the architect for the software all in the same room. These may all be from different vendors, but they are all working towards the same goal of establishing what the problem is, rather than defending their own patch. It can be really powerful, but when you have half a dozen, or ten, highly paid key people working on a project, all sitting, watching the same hourglass, it just doesn't work in the same way. You see the phones come out, and people checking their next appointment, and someone has to go off for a meeting. The difference is the ability to do it in real time. The moment someone throws out an idea, you explore that idea and immediately you can say, \"yes that looks like one that's worth exploring\" or \"no, it's not\". I like to say you're looking for a needle in a haystack, and the first thing you have to do is make sure you're looking in the right haystack. People can spend ages diving into the local haystack because that's the one they know, but you're never going to find the needle if you're in the wrong haystack. Being able to take masses of data and find ways of identifying and localizing the problem and drilling down from there again and again \u2013 doing that collaboratively \u2013 is a very powerful way of working.  \n  Tableau:\nTell me about another of your \u201caha\u201d moments working with Telco clients. Richard:\nRecently, we were looking at the total number of requests being made by all the customers over a day. Where's all the load coming from? When analysis is so quick, you can just try things, ranking things by every dimension you can think of. You don't know what you're looking for, but you can just look at things different ways. I ranked which handsets, which phone numbers, were generating the most requests in a day, and looked to see if there were any patterns in common with those. What we found was that 9 out of the top 10 handsets were the same make and model, and they were all prepaid customers. It turned out that there was some particular application running on this particular handset that would say, \u201ccan I go to the internet and use data please?\u201d and the billing system would say \u201cno\u201d because there was no credit. Three seconds later it would ask again, and the system would say no again. All day long it was stuck in repeat because the particular application on the handset wasn't being well behaved. The Telco customer and my customer were able to go back to the handset supplier and investigate and find out what application was behaving like that.  More importantly, it highlighted the risk that any particular application running on any handset any time or any day can come along and start behaving that way. So, they built additional safeguards into the way that the system works.  \n  Tableau:\nWhat would your Telco clients be doing without this analysis? Richard:\nTypically, this sort of thing only comes to light once it starts having a customer impact. The key driver for Telcos is to avoid an adverse impact on the customer experience because customers can change suppliers. The key thing is hanging on to your customers. So preempting problems, rather than reacting to them once they've actually materialized, is really powerful.  \n  Tableau:\nHow did you first get involved with Tableau? Richard:\nIt's been about three years ago now. We were working in the performance engineering space and very often dealing with large data sets. Unfortunately, performance testing and performance engineering tools tend to aggregate all the goodness out of the data. They take the view that there's too much data to work with, so they aggregate some of the data, which doesn't allow you to draw down to the fine detail for diagnostic purposes. We had been looking for alternatives, and we did a lot of work in Excel pre-aggregating the data ourselves. But the trouble with that is you don't know which dimensions to aggregate by. You make assumptions, but if there's a pattern in a different dimension that you've already aggregated out, you're not going to find it.\nWhen Microsoft came out with Excel 2007, which was going to lift all the limits, and it only lifted one or two of the limits, we decided we had to do something else. We set down the path of building our own tool. We actually built our own very crude type of tool that was very specialized on little bits of the problem we were interested in. Then one of my colleagues came across Tableau somewhere. We decided to stop working on our own tool and adopt Tableau. There were some things at the time that Tableau didn't do for us, but the number of the things that it did immediately was great, and the direction that it was going was obvious. In version 6, a lot of that has come to life.  \n  Tableau:\nCan you talk a little more about how other tools force you to pre-aggregate data and how Tableau stands out in comparison? Richard:\nWhen I'm trying to get to the bottom of issues in the performance space, I like to start from the high level view, the 50,000 feet view, and try to work out what basic area to look in for the answer. Then, it's really important to be able to drill down to the very fine grain detail. Lots of built-in reporting tools pre-aggregate the data. They assume you're going to be happy with every 10 second, or minute, or second aggregates. But if you have 1000 transactions a second, the average over a second distills out a lot of the important diagnostic value. So, the ability to have massive data that you can draw down to is really very powerful.  \n  Tableau:\nLet's talk about how you use Tableau to run collaborative meetings. A lot of our customers are trying to do that. What are the keys to doing it effectively? Richard:\nI do a lot of this work where I get several people together who are experts in different aspects of the same problem, or involved in a system front in different ways. One of the key things is to establish a common language \u2013 a common understanding of the metrics we're looking at. I often find myself doing statistics 101 and explaining the difference between percentiles and medians, just so everyone is talking the same language and understanding why I'm drawing down to this detail, or why I'm doing this, or why they see distributional data versus just averages.\n\nThen it's a question of encouraging the collaborative approach to work. People often say no question is a stupid question. We want it to be no suggestion is a stupid suggestion. People say, \u201cI wonder if it's correlated to such and such?\u201d It would be very easy to say, it's not worth it to drag that on the shelf. But my view is you should never assume the answer when you're looking for a problem. The golden rule is you don't know anything, so try everything. If the technology allows you to do things in sufficiently short time, you don't have to make assumptions of where to go looking.  \n  Tableau:\nOne of the strengths of Tableau, we believe, is that it lets business leaders and subject matter experts do their own analysis versus sending it out to some department and waiting for a report. As both an owner of Equinox and a subject matter expert, can you talk a bit about why it's so important to you to be able to do analysis yourself? Richard:\nThe key thing here is that very often you can't describe to someone what you want them to find. Tableau allows me to explore data without knowing what I'm looking for. I know something's in there, but I don't know quite what I'm going to find until I find it. You follow your nose, trust your instincts, and see the pattern jump out of the page. It's hard to express that as a requirement to someone else. In problem solving, I often see the situation where the client says that's that vendor's responsibility, and that's another vendor's responsibility, and we'll get this vendor to check on that, and this vendor to check on that, and the next day everyone reports back and says, \"I can't find anything\". All that tells me is that they couldn't find anything \u2013 not that it isn't there. The important thing for me is to be able to draw, explore, and slice and dice every which way until a pattern jumps out of the page and tells me answer. The next person might have the same visual but not join the dots to form that into an answer.  \n  Tableau:\nYour clients are obviously seeing some financial benefit from your use of Tableau, such as your examples of solving problems before they have an end customer impact. Can you talk a little about ROI for you or your customers? Richard:\nIt's difficult because most of my clients really wouldn't understand what they are getting. They don't know how hard the questions are they are having answered. All they understand is that the issues are being preempted. Tableau enables me to provide a better service to my customers, whether or not that's visible to the customer. I can get more insights more quickly as to what's going on in their data, help them get to the root cause of problems, and preempt problems before they manifest in a way that it impacts their customers. Of course that increases the chance that they will ask me to do more work for them.  \n   \n "

        "content": "We were using Excel, which is a fine tool, but we were getting more and more demands for division level reporting and analysis.  It was taking about a month to do each report.  Then another report would be needed, and we had to do the same work all over again.  We were getting swamped by these demands and doing repetitive work. We had to look for a different tool. So, we were Googling around.  I discovered Tableau.  We discovered a few other things, but I downloaded the free trial of Tableau.  Within an afternoon, I'd picked it up, dragged it in, and connected it to the same data that we were using to build the report.  Within an afternoon, I'd done what had been one or two weeks work. And instantly we could see that work. I only needed to do it once. When the data set changed, and I could just refresh.  I went straight to the managers going, \u201clook at this, look at this, look at this!\u201d It took us a few months. We're a slow, steady university. We don't throw the cash away very quickly and committees had to make some decisions, but we went for a couple licenses in January 2007, and we saw instant gains. Traditionally at the University of Oxford, people wanted tables of data. And that's great, we can do that in Tableau, we can give them the tables. But once we've been able to create the tables so quickly, we can then start aggregating the data and highlighting the particular aspects of the data that they need to be focusing on.  So it was that ability for us to save so much time, and that was like celebration in itself. But then to send information out to divisions and departments, and say, \u201dyeah, well you've had the table of data about performance and gender, but look, this chart shows you it's one particular program you need to be focusing on.\u201d  That information was hidden previously. Then, our Finance department started seeing what we've been doing.  They were in a similar situation where their finance system did not enable them to do any kind of information aggregation easily.  So they jumped on board. Now there are also people in Procurement, and I\u2019m going to be talking to our Alumni team soon because it would be good for their reporting.  We\u2019re in a situation where 7-8 years ago, we had no student system and really hopeless, old IT systems.  We've implemented a lot of IT systems.  Now that\u2019s matured enough and the data is going in with good enough quality.  So departments all around the university are beginning to go, \u201cokay, we need to leverage this data and get the benefit out from this data from the business point of view, the university point of view.\u201d In the student administration area, we started it off, we pioneered it, and then other people have seen these things; and our internal customers rave about it, and it seems everybody wants to be in on it. LinkedIn has also been a good area for people for discussing Tableau.  There are some great areas on LinkedIn.  We\u2019ve used it to recruit staff.  It's been a great way because we needed some reporting help, extra consultants.  In 2008, I organized a Tableau user group in the UK.  And it turns out Tableau hadn't done any users groups at that stage. I did it because I'm a passionate fan of the software.  It seemed to me, we were making great gains with the software and there were a lot of little people in the UK enjoying the software, and so why not get these people together? Tableau is a tool that generates a passion unlike any other tool I've ever used.  We just put out the email inviting people to come to Oxford, and 40 people showed up.  We had a really good day.  Pat Hanrahan was over, so he did a keynote speech. We got some great customer stories.  We went out to the pub afterwards, and did some really great networking. It was an amazing day. I felt really proud that I'd done it, and we're doing another one in a few weeks time.  That kind of thing just helps build the momentum, and keeps everyone motivated. Everyone learns from it. We shared the information across the team. We can just sit down with each other at the desk, drag and drop the stuff around the application and explore things together. That's a great way of learning.  We don't have much money to send people on lots of training courses. That would be my traditional way to get people ramped up on using Tableau, but fortunately Tableau provides hours and hours of free training. We were like, \u201cjust spend the day at home\u2014watch these videos, play around, download the sample workbooks.\u201d That's how they've learned. We have an internal user group as well.  Every two weeks our team gets together and we bring each other\u2019s problems to the meeting room and try to solve them as a group. That helps everybody. On top of that, there are whole pages of specific topics that you can search for.  If you want to know about calculated fields you can go and find the calculated fields training and that might only be half an hour or 20 minutes. We're all under pressure to do things quickly, but we've found that those 20 minutes or those two hours reap benefits down stream. The free training, as I said, is just a huge resource.  And my final recommendation, from the personal perspective, is that it\u2019s fun.  You don't know what the end picture is going to be when you're building a visualization, so you can just play around.  You start off with a vague question, and unlike other applications, you don't need to have an end result in mind. You just keep going until you get to the answer.  My recommendation is just dive in because it's going to cost you nothing to start, and you'll see great benefits, I'm sure."

        "content": "Interview with Cheryl Phillips, Data Enterprise Editor\nInterview with Justin Mayo, Computer-Assisted Reporting Specialist\nInterview with Whitney Stensrud, Assistant Art Director for Graphics The Seattle Times is the largest daily newspaper in the state of Washington and the only major daily print paper in Seattle. We talked to three members of the paper's team \u2013 an editor, a data journalist, and a designer \u2013 about how Tableau Public has transformed the way they develop stories and communicate with readers online. Tableau: What is the role of data in storytelling at The Seattle Times? Cheryl Phillips, Data Enterprise Editor: Data is vitally important to any storytelling that we do at The Seattle Times, and almost any news organization out there, because we often sift through and analyze data to be able to tell a trend or story. Especially as data has become more accessible to journalists, it's become more important in terms of understanding what's going on and being able to explain that to our readers. Tableau: How has the way you deal with data changed over the past five years or so? Cheryl: Using data in stories has evolved tremendously in the last decade, and especially in the last five years, in terms of being able to put it up online in useful ways, so that readers can drill down and find out what's happening in their neighborhood, or on a particular topic that they're interested in. Five years ago or ten years ago, I would sometimes get data on a nine-track tape or a reel-to-reel kind of setup that I would have to put into a special machine and extract. I would spend a lot of time just extracting the data, so that I could try to sift through it and make sense of it. Figuring out how to make it useful on the web was almost a nonexistent proposition. There were very few news organizations at that point that were doing a good job of putting data out there in any kind of searchable or visual format. In the last few years, especially the last two or three years, that has started to change. Journalists have learned programming skills as they've needed to, so that they could display the information. One of the really nice things about Tableau is you don't need to use programming to be able to present the data in a visually compelling way. Up until now, you pretty much had to know how to code and how to do some querying to be able to do that. Now you don't, as long as you understand a little bit about data and you have somebody you can access who understands a little bit about visual design. Or you can learn it yourself, and you can put together presentations that are very compelling. It's going to continue to evolve because we can now take massive amounts of data and make them searchable and interactive. The data can help tell the story, along with the words on the page or the screen. Tableau: What's the value to The Seattle Times of making data interactive rather than a static chart? Cheryl: One of the reasons that interactive data is so important is because it brings our readers in and allows them to engage in our site a little bit more than they might otherwise do. It keeps them involved in the activity of reading our news, and it also allows them to get information that they can use that they wouldn't have by simply reading the story. They can use a Tableau visualization to drill down and find information. Tableau: Does Tableau play a role in helping journalists at to find and develop their stories? Cheryl: We try to figure out what our story is, and if it's something that needs to be told. We do that through analyzing or querying the data. The nice thing about Tableau is that it's a full-featured product. You can query the data visually, and that helps inform the reporter about trends. Instead of just trying to look through rows and columns, you can actually see what it looks like on a scatter plot or a fever line or things like that. We use Tableau in the reporting process, and then take that and develop it further to put it online for our readers as a presentation tool. Tableau: Can you give an example of a story you did with Tableau? Cheryl: When Ken Griffey, Jr. announced his retirement from baseball, I thought we should take a look at his stats and compare them to other top players. Just take a look and allow our sports fan readers to do the same thing. We were building a whole package to commemorate his career, and we wanted to be able to include a way for our readers to be able to explore that a little bit more. So, we did a Tableau visualization as part of this entire section. Tableau: What feedback have you had on the visualizations you've done, whether from readers or colleagues internally? Cheryl: When we first started thinking about using Tableau, we had a meeting with some of our graphic design people. We explained what we were doing with Tableau and what we thought was possible. They all thanked us because they had been wanting to get more involved in making graphics interactive online, but they didn't have the tools in place to be able to do it. They're not programmers; they're graphic designers. We could give them data sets and say, \"Look, here's where we think the trends are,\" but for them to be able to put it in a form that is visually compelling for our readers was a game-changer. Tableau: Has Tableau had an impact on newsroom collaboration? Cheryl: Yes, collaboration is a key part of Tableau and how we've built it into our structure. I serve as kind of a funnel, along with one of the directors for graphic design. We collaborate on everything. We start with the story idea, and we talk about. Should it make a Tableau visualization? What could it do that would be different that would move the story forward? Then our data specialists and I start building it. Or sometimes the artist starts it. Then we swap back and forth and everybody gives feedback before we decide to actually publish it. It's a very collaborative process, probably much more so than some of our other processes. Tableau: Is the process different from creating something interactive in Flash? How would you compare the tools? Cheryl: Building a Flash interactive is a similar process, but we also have to involve some of our online web folks to build it, or at least to make sure that we've got it on the page correctly. We still do a lot of talking back and forth, but there's less doing back and forth. There's less flexibility with those more programming-heavy kind of tools. Flash is also much more time-intensive for us, and we don't have as many folks who have the time available. Whereas, our bicycle accident visualization, we built in a day with Tableau and launched the very next day. I don't know that I want to do all of them that quickly. I'd like to spend a little more time being thoughtful, but it shows that we can use it for very quick-turnaround types of stories, and that's just really very difficult with Flash. In terms of resources, we use Flash rarely and only for large projects that merit extra time and attention. With Tableau, we can use it frequently and we can use it on all levels of projects. It could be, for example, a city budget presentation or a long-form investigative project that really needs some extra storytelling visually online. Tableau: How long does it typically take you to get stories live with Tableau? Cheryl: It usually takes us about a week before we publish a Tableau project, or sometimes two weeks if it's a really big project that we want to spend a lot of time and care on. But we can publish Tableaus in an afternoon if we need to, and we have done that. Certainly with a breaking news story, we might be inclined to do something like that if it were something that could be told visually using some kind of data. Tableau: Can you tell us a little bit about the business goals and metrics of The Seattle Times, and how interactive visualizations work with that? Cheryl: I work in the newsroom, so I don't pay as much attention to the business metrics as some at our paper might, but we do watch what kind of traffic a story or visualization gets. We follow metrics like \"most read,\" \"most emailed,\" and \"most commented,\" and we certainly want our readers to spend time on our site. Anything that engages our readers more is a good tool, and for us it's a public service. Tableau visualizations fall into that category. As an ancillary benefit, it's great that they get traffic and they get a lot of interaction from our reader. And as a public service benefit, it's just vital to us that we're bringing in our readers and allowing them to find their own individual stories in the mix of data that we might present. Tableau: So how have the Tableau visualizations that you've done performed in terms of traffic, discussion, comments, and so on? Cheryl: Some of our Tableau visualizations have created a lot of buzz among our readers, and have been sent around and posted on other blogs and things like that. Particularly the bicycle accident visualization that we created got a lot of attention. There were a number of comments on the story talking about the visualization. It was gratifying to see that readers were noticing that we were doing something different, and that it wasn't just a flat, static graphic. The numbers that we've seen, in terms of traffic on our Tableaus rank right up there with the same level of interaction we get from our stories. So that's, to me, a success because we're getting the same number of readers looking at the visualization as are reading the story, and in some cases, four or five times that number. So, it's a really positive piece of our entire presentation. Tableau: You spend a lot of time with IRE and other organizations thinking about the future of journalism. How do you see Tableau helping that? Do you feel like The Seattle Times is a leader in data journalism because of what you've been able to do with Tableau? Cheryl: I've talked to a lot of other journalists in other newsrooms about how they present their data online and what methods they use. There are a number of folks who do their own programming to create searchable data, but there's been a lot of enthusiasm about what can be done with Tableau visualizations. With Tableau, information can be used quickly and turned around to serve readers right away. Virtually every news organization out there right now is trying to figure out how to make sure that their readers are engaged in what they're providing, and having interactive visualizations on our site is critical to doing that. It keeps us ahead of the curve and ahead of the competition with other news sites. We need to be leaders in our field, and Tableau helps us do that. Tableau: What is your vision for data journalism at The Seattle Times? Cheryl: Especially as data becomes more transparent and more available to the general public, our role as journalists \u2013 just like with any story \u2013 is to sift that information and find the stories within it, and then provide it to the reader in a way that's usable. Using tools is critical: everything from our own programming to using Tableau visualizations to using mapping tools. Enabling the reader to better understand the story and the import is vital to our success as a news organization. Tableau has helped move us leaps and bounds ahead of where we were, and I can see a use for it in stories on a daily basis. At this point, we're only limited by the amount of hours we can spend building the visualizations. Tableau: Specifically, what do you see as the value of bringing Tableau visualizations to your readers? Cheryl: Data visualization is critical to what we do because we want to be able to provide our readers with information that they can use, that will help them sift through a story, and make sure that they can make sense of the news of the day. If we have data that allows our readers to drill down to their neighborhood or drill down into a particular subject or topic that's important to them, then that is something that we need to be doing. Visualizations using Tableau are particularly useful for us, because we can do them so quickly, and we can do them without programming, and we can turn them around in a deadline situation if we need to. Tableau: How does that play into hyperlocal interests? Does it make it easier to make stories appeal to people in very different communities, like Capitol Hill versus Bellevue? Cheryl: This is an example of how Tableau visualizations are really useful for us. We're about to launch a visualization on crime in Seattle, and crime is a very hot-button issue for people. They want to know not only, \"Are car thefts up,\" but, \"Are there any car thefts on my block?\" \"Have my neighbors been robbed?\" \"Do I have to worry about a, a predator three blocks over?\" With Tableau, we can take this crime data, which is difficult to sift through and sometimes in not very friendly jargon, and we can put it into a visualization, so that people can, at a glance, see their neighborhood and how they compare with other neighborhoods. Then they can drill down and see exactly what happened in their area. That is one of those useful tools that helps readers get to what exactly is happening on the ground, on the street, that we would never be able to do in the past, That is so important, especially as hyperlocal sites become more popular."

        "content": "Blastrac Manufacturing is a mid-sized worldwide manufacturer that operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Blastrac depended on the creation and distribution of reports across the organization to make business decisions. However, the company did not have a consistent reporting method in place and, consequently, preparation of reports for the company\u2019s various needs (sales data, working capital, inventory, purchase analysis, etc.) was tedious. Blastrac\u2019s analysts each spent nearly one whole day per week (a total of 20-30 hours) extracting data from the multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, loading it into several Excel spreadsheets, creating filtering capabilities and establishing pre-defined pivot tables. Not only were these massive spreadsheets often inaccurate and consistently hard to understand, but also they were virtually useless for the sales team, which couldn\u2019t work with the complex format. In addition, each consumer of the reports had different needs\u2014while some thought the reports were lacking detail, others thought there was far too much detail to wade through. Blastrac Vice President and CIO Dan Murray began looking for a solution to the company\u2019s reporting troubles. He quickly ruled out the rollout of a single ERP system, a multi-million dollar proposition. He also eliminated the possibility of an enterprise-wide business intelligence (BI) platform deployment because of cost\u2014quotes from five different vendors ranged from $130,000 to over $500,000. What Murray needed was a solution that was affordable, could deploy quickly without disrupting current systems and was able to represent data consistently regardless of the multiple currencies Blastrac operates in. Working with IT services consultant Interworks, Inc. out of Oklahoma, Murray and team finessed the data sources. Murray then deployed two data visualization tools from Tableau Software: Tableau Desktop, a visual data analysis solution that allowed Blastrac analysts to quickly and easily create intuitive and visually compelling reports, and Tableau Reader, a free application that enabled everyone across the company to directly interact with the reports, filtering, sorting, extracting and printing data as it fit their needs. And at a total cost of less than one third the lowest competing BI quote, Tableau fit Blastrac\u2019s budget too. With only one hour per week now required to create reports\u2014a 95-percent increase in productivity\u2014and updates to these reports happening automatically though Tableau, Murray and his team are able to proactively identify major business events reflected in company data\u2014such as an exceptionally large sale\u2014instead of reacting to incoming questions from employees as they had been forced to do previously. \u201cPrior to deploying Tableau, I spent countless hours customizing and creating new reports based on individual requests, which was not efficient or productive for me,\u201d said Murray. \u201cWith Tableau, we create one report for each business area, and, with very little training, they can explore the data themselves. By deploying Tableau, I not only saved thousands of dollars and endless months of deployment, but I\u2019m also now able to create a product that is infinitely more valuable for people across the organization.\u201d Contact: visualanalysis@tableau.com or call (206) 633-3400 x1"

The team has a large national following which is perhaps best represented by the NFL record for number of consecutive games at sold-out stadiums. Bill Priakos, COO of the Dallas Cowboys Merchandising division, and his team needed more visibility into their data so they could run it more profitably. Microsoft was selected as the baseline platform for this upgrade as well as a number of other sales, logistics and ecommerce applications. The Cowboys expected that this new information architecture would provide the needed analytics and reporting. Unfortunately, this was not the case and the search began for a robust dashboarding, analytics and reporting tool to fill this gap. Tableau and Teknion together provided real-time reporting and dashboard capabilities that exceeded the Cowboys\u2019 requirements. Systematically and methodically the Teknion team worked side by side with data owners and data users within the Dallas Cowboys to deliver all required functionality, on time and under budget. \u201cEarly in the process, we were able to get a clear understanding of what it would take to run a more profitable operation for the Cowboys,\u201d said Teknion Vice President Bill Luisi. \u201cThis process step is a key step in Teknion\u2019s approach with any client, and it always pays huge dividends as the implementation plan progresses.\u201d Added Luisi, \u201cOf course, Tableau worked very closely with us and the Cowboys during the entire project. Together, we made sure that the Cowboys could achieve their reporting and analytical goals in record time.\u201d Now, for the first time, the Dallas Cowboys are able to monitor their complete merchandising activities from manufacture to end customer and see not only what is happening across the life-cycle, but drill down even further into why it is happening. Today, this BI solution is used to report and analyze the business activities of the Merchandising Division which is responsible for all of the Dallas Cowboys brand sales. Industry estimates say that the Cowboys generate 20% of all NFL merchandise sales, which reflects the fact they are the most recognized sports franchise in the world.

Cornell has been described as the first truly American university because of its founders\u2019 revolutionary egalitarian and practical vision of higher education, and it is dedicated to its land-grant mission of outreach and public service. With fourteen Colleges and Schools, Cornell serves over 2,700 faculty and over 20,000 graduate and undergraduate students. Cornell University began using Tableau in late 2007 as a reporting tool that would allow its college deans to better track KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). At that time it purchased one Tableau Server and 20 Desktop licenses. The Ivy League university has been so impressed that it has since increased its Tableau footprint to two servers and 150 desktop licenses. Today, more than 600 employees use Tableau to do all manner of analysis: from dissecting the student applicant pool to managing contributor relations, from evaluating risk to analyzing university expenditures, and from visualizing faculty salary statistics to keeping track of which students are in what classes.   Note: Data has been redacted to protect confidentiality. Cornell is doing all of this faster and more efficiently than they ever thought possible. \u201cWe produce ten times the analysis in half the time, with half the staff,\u201d said Cindy Sedlacek, Director of Data Administration for the university\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences. Cornell uses Tableau to meet the needs of both highly sophisticated technical workers and hundreds of other employees who rely on the software everyday to answer important questions but whose jobs don\u2019t revolve around data management. \u201cAdoption of Tableau for a variety of our business needs has gone beyond our expectations,\u201d Cindy said. For example, Cornell receives tens of thousands of applications every year. \u201cWe need access to this information quickly and easily,\u201d Cindy said as she opened a Tableau server dashboard. Within seconds she had drilled deep into a database that held all manner of applicant information, from SAT distributions and GPA to demographic and geographic stats. \u201cLook, that\u2019s interesting,\u201d said Cindy, looking at a state\u2019s application pool. \u201cHere we accepted a larger percentage of (the gender) but we received more applications from (the other gender). I can easily spot this because of Tableau\u2019s robust, built-in mapping capabilities that allow you to plot your geographic data on US, world, and even custom Cornell maps.\u201d \u201cThere are tools that are beasts in the BI world,\u201d said Cindy. With Tableau there simply weren\u2019t implementation problems. \u201cWe were able to easily integrate with our single sign-on mechanism, deploy metadata quickly and allow report developers direct publishing access (no need for a publishing \u201cmiddleman\u201d with Tableau). Also rollout was not a challenge because the software was so intuitive \u2013 trainings have been minimal apart from quarterly user group meetings. And, when called upon, Tableau customer service has been exceptional! Perhaps most significant is that Tableau has allowed for more collaborations and an opportunity for a more unified management approach. With the increased adoption of Tableau across campus, new doors for collaboration continue to open in the areas of data access, common business definitions, merging of user communities, and governance.

        "content": "The Epidemiology Department at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center- School of Public Health collaborates with hospitals and other providers around the state to meet the requirements of a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The grant funds the school\u2019s Louisiana Breast and Cervical Health Program (LBCHP) to fulfill its mission to ensure that uninsured and underinsured Louisiana women have access to and receive high-quality screening and diagnostic services for the early detection of cancer. Jennifer Hayden, IT analyst at LBCHP, said, \u201cI needed a visualization tool that would help us provide feedback to our providers. We use Tableau to generate progress reports for our providers to show them how they\u2019re performing and how they\u2019re contributing to the program\u2019s statewide success.\u201d In addition to giving feedback to providers, LBCHP has found Tableau useful for quality control by looking for outliers in their data. \u201cIf a provider is having a problem in a given indicator, we\u2019ve created visualizations to understand it: why is it happening and how is it happening? We\u2019ll look at how many individuals are falling outside of the indicator. For example, in our breast rescreening project we looked at who comes back for rescreening. Who are the women who are extending their time longer than the recommended 18 months for rescreening mammograms? We dig deep into patient info for quality control, finding trends, and working on program evaluation.\u201d \u201cAfter Hurricane Rita, we lost a lot of physicians from southeastern Louisiana. One of the hospitals we work with lost their radiologist. They had to contract out with a radiology group, remotely. The radiology group waited until the very last minute to read the mammogram which caused our data to become untimely. Using Tableau, we discovered that we had a trend of screenings taking much longer, affecting our timeliness. We approached that hospital and requested that they renegotiate their contract with the radiology group. We always try to take action based on the results,\u201d said Jennifer. Using Tableau has enabled LBCHP to improve program performance and apply for funding for other programs. The organization is applying for another grant to screen for colorectal cancer. \u201cIn a pilot study, we found patients with precancerous indications--Tableau helped us visualize the data,\u201d said Hayden. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking to grantors, you need to show results and you need to show them in an easy-to-understand, visually enticing way.\u201d LBCHP also uses the software to allow people throughout their organization find answers. \u201cWe use the software to explore. For people who don\u2019t have the SQL skills and for groups that don\u2019t have huge resources to spend on a large, specialized IT staff, it\u2019s been extremely beneficial to be able to explore our data in sophisticated ways without being sophisticated programmers.

But these reports proved to be extremely time consuming to create and difficult to understand\u2014the team would spend days creating reports that provided only minimal value to its customers. In order to extract more value from its data, the BSS/IT department deployed Tableau\u2019s visual data analysis software.

With the help of Tableau, Tobin was able to take on the challenge. DePauw\u2019s immediate need was to take the student metrics, enrollment, peer groups, and financials from their Oracle database, and visualize it all in a way that would help them make strategic plans. Tobin\u2019s other equally important challenge was to make the data available to the people who could use it. That meant the data must be \u201caccessible to people who don\u2019t work with it all the time.\u201d Tobin used Tableau to visually analyze the data, then distributed it in reports to the different departments.  Sorting out the student demographic data was only the starting point. Once he did that, Tobin used Tableau to facilitate their beginning-of-the-year reporting needs. Tobin explains that before Tableau there was very large strategic indicator report that needed to be produced. \u201cIt took weeks, it was just a major undertaking bringing in disparate reports from the various departments and divisions!\u201d Now DePauw is able to apply 20 very strategic indicators to give the University Board a sense of where they are with enrollment, peer groups, and financials. \u201cThe entire thing is done in Tableau,\u201d said Tobin. The weeks-long \u201cnightmare\u201d is now down to half a day\u2019s work. \u201cWe can clearly show the Board projections by switching the comparison groups, and that allows them to easily visualize changes.\u201d Now Tobin uses Tableau to create a \u201ctruly strategic planning document.\u201d When looking at the data he says \u201cit\u2019s no longer a question of making the data accessible, now it\u2019s more like let\u2019s play, let\u2019s ask questions!\u201d He recalls the morning a senior advisor to the president came down and started asking him questions off the top of his head. Tobin opened Tableau. The senior advisor was clearly impressed: \u201cCan we do that by gender? Ethnicity? Home state? Can we see average SAT score? This is great!\u201d Importantly, in addition to the immediate ROI impact of cutting out weeks of time previously invested in the STI, Tobin says he is now able to explore student data easily, and without writing code. \u201cI\u2019m in it every day. I\u2019ve connected right to our Oracle tables, I\u2019ve got live data!\u201d Tobin is happy to report \u201cWe\u2019re now able to develop much easier, faster and more accurate strategic indicator reports.\u201d Today, DePauw uses Tableau for everything from student data to analyzing peak periods in class schedules. The school has also found Tableau to be an essential tool for grades, as it allows them to very quickly verify and filter data. And DePauw uses Tableau for its Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS) reporting. With Tableau they can set up a report that\u2019s exactly in the IPEDS format so it completely simplifies the reporting. \u201cAnother thing I did\u201d, Tobin recalls, \u201cwas an alumni map.

The Ingenuity Media Group, as with most marketing and advertising agencies, relies heavily upon measurement capabilities to gauge how external audiences perceive their clients\u2019 online advertising and interactive media, the overall success of campaigns and, most importantly, quickly identify and correct any issues with a campaign. Speed, accuracy and flexibility are vital to the creation of useful reports, and how they are presented helps showcase the Ingenuity Media Group\u2019s work by quickly identifying which brands and campaigns are effective or, alternately, what changes need to be made to increase their effectiveness. Producing these analyses with Ingenuity Media Group\u2019s traditional processes, however, was an extremely time-consuming task. In order to produce reports for its clients, analysts had to spend hours processing data and converting it into visual form. From there, they created an Excel document and converted it to a PDF, before finally sending the information to the client. With this method in place, preparing weekly, bi-weekly or monthly reports took hours. Ingenuity Media Group needed a tool that would aid in data manipulation to create useful and easy-to-understand reports for its clients. Since deploying Tableau\u2019s intuitive visual data analysis solution, the company is able to more quickly and accurately analyze data for its clients in order to identify campaigns and media that are underperforming.

Kwantum\u2019s typical process for survey analysis and reporting\u2014involving a combination of Excel pivot tables, charts and VBA macros\u2014was extremely time-consuming and produced only static but extremely lengthy reports. As a result, clients were losing interest and missing potentially important findings and results. The company needed a survey analysis and reporting tool that would not only improve its internal operational processes but also increase the quality of its customer offerings by structuring results visually In addition, Kwantum required a solution that was able to access its massive ChoiceMonitor database (up to 200 million rows of data) without impacting the integrity of its other systems. Finally, given the ever-changing market conditions in the automotive industry, Kwantum\u2019s clients required reports and dashboards that offered real-time information as well as the ability to further interact with the data to a degree that static Excel tables don\u2019t allow. Kwantum deployed Tableau\u2019s visual analysis applications to enable it to easily distribute and share advanced analyses with its customers. Tableau\u2019s ability to access data directly from the ChoiceMonitor database and present it in real-time to clients via a browser allowed the individual customers to interact with the data, highlighting specific points of interest, modifying the view or customizing their analyses\u2014all without having to recreate entire reports from the ground up or learn complicated query languages. \u201cAlthough Kwantum is a boutique market research firm, the ease in which Tableau is installed and deployed allowed us to share data and insights with our clients much more rapidly, as if we had the IT resources of a much larger firm,\u201d said Piotr Motyka, principal and co-owner of Kwantum. \u201c Tableau has also enabled Kwantum to significantly increase the customer\u2019s ability to understand and benefit from the data, resulting in higher customer satisfaction. The solution enables Kwantum\u2019s clients to rapidly see important trends without having to spend hours wading through data and spreadsheets. Additionally, Tableau allowed Kwantum\u2019s analysts to concentrate on discussing results and working on conclusions with clients, rather than only delivering data. Kwantum replaced hundreds of pages of reports (each formatted separately) with 21 easy-to-understand dashboards."

PNNL wanted to address the question of mixed data: information typically found in structured forms with annotations, case files, reports, etc. Said Calapristi during a presentation to a VAC Consortium Meeting, \u201cwe wanted to ensure data sharing and interoperability and to facilitate data exchange between specialized tools. We wanted to build upon the known strengths of current technologies. This would give us the potential for earlier field deployment and user acceptance as well as compatibility with wider toolsets.\u201d Since PNNL was already using standalone analysis applications for managing and reviewing its unstructured data, it needed to identify a structured data analysis tool that would seamlessly integrate with the preexisting analysis technology and provide new ways to visually organize and present information.

Every year more than 10,000 students from Alabama, the southeast and overseas attend JSU. Within the busy hub of the university, a stalwart team of four at the Office of Institutional Research and Assessment collects and analyzes organizational data. The Director, Dr. Alicia Simmons, grew up in Jacksonville and graduated from JSU. Twenty years later, her team\u2019s work contributes to smooth operations across nearly 100 academic and non-academic departments with over 1,000 faculty and staff. The small office struggled with the complex task of making credit hour productivity visible to departments and administrators. In the business of education that means looking for trends in student preference in the academic schedule. The team wanted to create optimal course calendars from term to term based on a solid understanding of the data. Pages and pages of spreadsheets made this job difficult. Ultimately, it took too long to get the data into the spreadsheets to produce anything meaningful in time for optimal decision-making. Dr. Simmons, recognized that with such limited technology the university was headed down the slippery slope of inefficiency. For example, they could not easily identify that 8am classes do well but the same course at 3pm is not as popular. JSU continuously missed opportunities to make schedule adjustments that would best meet the needs of a diverse student body. She decided to take action. There were no funds to hire new staff, so the team had to find other means to get the job done. They turned to Tableau to save time and resources. Dr. Simmons described the experience, \u201cTableau has helped us to provide systematic support to many different departments and increase productivity of this department. We can do analyses that we did before in a fraction of the time. Even more important, we can do analyses we never could before.\u201d Now JSU can visually analyze its master schedule and pick out opportunities to increase credit hour productivity. Everyone has the same view and access to the same data so decision making is accelerated. Data can be analyzed in nearly real-time, so patterns can be corrected in time for the start of the next term. JSU also found another application for their Tableau visuals. The JSU Fact Book is an annual publication that reflects the history and progress of the university, and is distributed to JSU administration, faculty and the community. The publication used to take nearly a semester to complete in Excel. Now using Tableau, Simmons reported, \u201cWe can take the format we\u2019ve set up and use it with next year\u2019s data. Saves a good bit of time versus re-creating in Excel.\u201d She added, \u201cOur Fact Book was just awarded second place among all universities in the southeast at the Southern Association for Institutional Research conference.\u201d Contact: visualanalysis@tableau.com or call (206)633-3400 x1"

We\u2019re running a business and we want to bring value to our clients, we want to bring value to our organization. So, the impact is real and we measure it; it's been significant. Tableau: Why do you use Tableau to analyze market data?\nScott: We\u2019re able to perform derived analytics on hundreds, thousands of different fields, and then bring that in, visualize it, get insights, act on it, tell stories over it, in a very quick way. The objective of a tool like Tableau is to make it simple. Not simplistic but simple. We wanted to deploy this real simply for our traders and clients to determine when we might suggest they sell a security, and when they could buy it. We can filter by economic sector, security, date, and trader type. You can really very quickly get an idea of when the high probability entry or exit points are for security. Tableau: How has Tableau helped you gain insight from big data?\nScott: Tableau has opened up a whole new field for us in being able to act on insights where normally we may have had to just do sampling, we can now look at whole populations of data. We have 800 securities that we're calculating predictive analytics on to determine from a real time standpoint when to enter or exit positions. Tableau: How does that help your clients?\nScott: We are currently accurate about 80, 85 percent of the time. So, this has incredible implications for us and for our clients. The insights from, for example, how could I have implemented a trade better can yield 100-fold thousand time improvement in your cost. And in our economic environment those type of insights are incredibly valuable. We're talking about the difference between staying in business and not. Tableau: You found us early on. What drew your attention?\nScott: I've always been resourceful, and in my industry, the financial services industry, the price of entry for products can run anywhere from $25,000, $50,000, $100,000 and up. I was looking for something that I could deploy quickly and on my desktop, and I looked at a number of data vis tools back in 2006. Tableau really caught my eye as just something that was absolutely awesome. I say, in business you want to catch a wave, and I caught an early wave. Tableau: You were looking for flexibility with data sources?\nScott: Flexibility and connectivity were really things I was looking for. We deal with a lot of data, a lot of structured data, a lot of unstructured data, and in particular like time series data. And I wanted something that was flexible enough to work in text, spreadsheets, SQL databases, MySQL, a number of other variety of tools\u2014 and this was even before the big data. Tableau: How did your implementation go? How has it grown?\nScott: Since I'm one of the partners and I run IT, I really can have a lot of flexibility. I encourage my people to really stay abreast of technology and try new things. So, our implementation really started with me downloading the trial on my computer and just starting to work with it. We've deployed it across our organization with a handful of users, but primarily we're using it right now with Tableau Server internally, and externally with a few stakeholders. So, we've been pretty guarded with some of the stuff that we're deploying. Tableau: What impact has Tableau had on the organization?\nScott: Tableau has had a tremendous impact on our organization. When I originally started using it, Tableau, I really thought I had a secret weapon.The impact has been really rapid fire for us in enabling to tell a story very quickly, consume a lot of data, look at it across multiple dimensions. The impact has also been in real dollars. We've been able to export some of our insights to our clients and make serious money off of it, whether it be from a consulting project or through ongoing kind of decision-making tools. The impact is in the seven figures, so it's significant. Tableau: So it\u2019s expanded your business offerings?\nScott: It's given us a new business model. We're able to bring to market product much quicker than we would have without a team of analysts in the way. So, we're able to really flatten the layers and really build upon what we have, which is our skill and toolset, and Tableau is a core component of that. Tableau: What\u2019s next for you and Tableau?\nScott: We\u2019re using Tableau right now for real time decision support. We're really pushing the edges of Tableau. We would love to see it deployed in more of a clustering framework in the cloud. We want to start deploying this to clients in a larger way with growing graphs and things like that. What's next is wider deployment, wider consumption of the product internally and externally, and to continue to push the envelope."
