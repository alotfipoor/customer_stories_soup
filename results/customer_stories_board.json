        "content": "Board Project OverviewDivision:\u00a0Supply Chain FinanceImplemented solution:\u00a0Integrated Corporate Planning - Driver Based Supply Chain Planning and ForecastingProject scope:\u00a0Manufacturing (48 plants), Warehousing (85 sites), Cold Drinks Operations & LogisticsUser types:\u00a0CFO, Head of SCM, Controllers, Department and Plant ManagersThe Starting Point: Spotlighting the \u201cgray world\u201d of supply chainTo understand Coca-Cola's challenge, and the consequent Board solution, we start with the company\u2019s desire to transform its Supply Chain Finance according to three guidelines: leaner finance, automated planning, and optimized reporting. As Ivan Evstatiev, Senior Manager, Planning & Performance Management at Coca-Cola European Partners, states:This is a true story of a business case of complex corporate finance made simple (or at least greatly simplified).As enablers of this transformation, the Group identified three connected intervention areas:The evolution of planning methodology from the \u201cclassic\u201d finance approach to the adoption of Driver-Based PlanningDigital innovation; moving away from Excel and Access to implement a modern solution to\u00a0achieve integrated corporate planning and analysisEnhancement of the organization\u2019s mindset and communication among the different teamsIn a nutshell, the Group aimed to combine a new software solution with a new way of planning, underpinned by comprehensive communication across the company. Ivan explains:This transformation involved pretty much the whole scope of our Supply Chain Finance department, that is half of our Coca-Cola world.\u00a0We refer to this field as 'the gray world', simply because \u2013 compared to more visible areas such as Sales and Marketing \u2013 the supply chain gives rise to both technological and financial complexities. Therefore, it was extremely critical for us to engage the finance functions in our vision of transformation.Transformation at Work: Driver-Based PlanningThe concept of Driver-Based Planning can be simplified in one sentence: financial planning explained through operational data and business drivers/metrics (or Key Business Indicators - KBIs). It covers something that conventional planning is not able to do; it closes the gap between targets, forecasts, and resource allocation. Coca-Cola European Partners needed a solution that could combine both financial and operational analysis and planning to effectively enable the driver-based planning approach.The Board Intelligent Planning platform turned out to be the best fit for Coca-Cola\u2019s needs because it offers smarter planning, actionable insights, and better outcomes. In addition, Board could fulfil one of the most important requirements of the driver-based planning approach, as Ivan highlights:Picking only those variables \u2013 which indeed we call drivers - that are tangible in terms of the control of the management. In this way the driver-based planning can be 'digestible' and \u2013 finally \u2013 bridge finance teams with their operational business partners.The KBIs Coca-Cola monitors and controls in its driver-based planning activities are grouped as follows:LEADING KBIsSales VolumeProduction VolumeFull Time Equivalents (FTEs)ProductivityLAGGING KBIsPayroll VarianceLine SpeedReturns\"Imagine a production line - let\u2019s suppose it\u2019s the bottling/canning line. As you may know, that line has a particular speed of bottles per hour and a particular productivity level based on the productivity of the people who work on that line. You might have a crew composed of four operators, one technician, and two asset care planners to enable that production line to work, and essentially you have production volume or estimated production volume that has to run on the line itself,\" Ivan explains.Thanks to Board, Coca-Cola can easily check and analyze how much salary, social security benefit, payroll tax, and other elements it needs to pay to the above-mentioned operators, technicians, and care planners who work on the canning line. The company can also instantly see how much electricity and water that the production line is consuming, as well as how much maintenance and preventive care is required.\u00a0These reports and analyses are seamlessly combined with the simulation capabilities of the Board platform itself. Let us suppose, for example, the production controller wants to evaluate a hypothetical operational change in the crew pattern of a specific production line, and consequently a change in the work schedule. Through the simulation capabilities of Board, the controller can see the financial impact of those changes, e.g. the cost of labor and the cost of utilities, enabling them to decide which changes to the crew pattern or work schedule are best. \u00a0\u00a0\"By the click on a button and a few calculations and algorithms working in the background, we are able to immediately gain full control of the operational data. In fact, we can immediately get a fully-fledged plan, and\u00a0this is exactly the concept of bridging finance teams with their operational business partners and making them talk to each other. In this way, operational people - or whatever business people we can imagine - can directly link the operational data to the financial data, keeping the health of the company under control. In the past I had to adjust \u2013 for example \u2013 one particular P&L line, basing my choices on gut feeling. But today, thanks to Board, we can justify our decisions directly on operational data,\" Ivan continues.From Manufacturing Plants to Vending Machines: All FMCG supply chain activities on the Board platformAs an FMCG company, Coca-Cola European Partners needs to ensure full supply chain visibility as well as complete harmonization between various production and delivery stages at all times. To achieve this, rigorous planning processes and frequent forecasting are required, as well as monitoring of closing activities.As part of the company\u2019s cold drinks operations, all vending machines found in local stores need to be managed and controlled, including their placement, activities, movement, and maintenance. Line-of-business managers in manufacturing, warehouses, and logistics, among other departments, must derive tangible business value from the huge pool of data created by this process and generate a healthy flow of information throughout the value chain, as Ivan highlights:What we cover with Board is pretty much the whole myriad of activities that supply chain touches today.\u00a0This means 48 plants, 85 warehouses, everything that you can imagine around distribution, from trade to branch local delivery division, and so on.\u00a0Everything is integrated into the Board platform: every site, plant, and any aspect of logistics.Project ScopeWeekly and monthly forecasting (mid-month & end-month)Monitoring of closing activitiesAnnual business planning/budgetingFull-fledged country consolidation & monthly reportingEuropean Group/entire Coca-Cola European Partners Supply Chain consolidationIn light of the areas of transformation we undertook \u2013 a new planning methodology, digitalization, and new cultural mindset \u2013 Board has allowed us to positively achieve our project goals, delivering\u00a0time efficiency,\u00a0process automation,\u00a0standardization, and data centralization, and increase\u00a0ease of use\u00a0and\u00a0system maintainability as well.Time Efficiency in Finance Activities: 10% manual and 90% digitalThanks to the digital transformation of financial activities with Board, Coca-Cola European Partners now saves significant amounts of time, allowing teams to focus on analytics and decision-making and find opportunities for continuous improvement, rather than spending time on manual, non-value-added work, as Ivan explains:10% of the input of our finance supply chain activities are based on country-specific business insights, whereas 90% consists of pre-populated Profit & Loss outputs thanks to the value driver methodology and the automation of operational data input.\u00a0We do not want finance people to struggle with all the tedious sequential steps of preparing a plan: we wanted to digitalize this area and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve succeeded in doing with the Board platform.Time Efficiency in Data Transfer: Changing the status quo from 24 hours to 15 minutesAlongside time efficiency from a financial standpoint, Board has also enabled Coca-Cola to increase efficiency from a data transfer perspective. Before implementing Board, the company was stuck in a 'culture' of overnight data loads and transfers due to system performance. As today's organizations deal with a huge amount of data, it is essential to have updated, relevant information in (nearly) real-time, allowing employees to quickly gain the most recent meaningful insights to boost the entire planning process from goal setting down to operational execution.Ivan highlights the benefits of the new approach:Now we have a data transfer every 15 minutes from our ERP system to the cloud and from the cloud to Board, and we can effectively monitor how our data transfer is evolving at any given time per country. We can prepare complete financial statements from a profit and loss perspective. So,\u00a0compared to the 24 hour-cycle we were committed to doing before, 15 minutes is definitely a great revolution and the breaking of status quo, as well as out-of-the-box thinking.Live Status Tracker: When automation means keeping pace with fast changesIn the FMCG industry, more than others, small numerical changes can have a remarkable impact on the whole planning processes, up to the very top of the supply chain consolidation. Before using Board's automation capabilities, Coca-Cola struggled with complex Excel files and Access Databases linked together, not always allowing multiple users to access information. Different teams and managers had to periodically communicate with each other to be sure they were all aligned. Everyone from the CFO to the Head of SCM, Controllers, and Department & Plant Managers needed to call one another each month and ask the people in charge of a given planning process if they were still working on their numbers or if the current values could be trusted, then pick them and carry on to the next step within the hierarchy.Ivan explains how things have now improved:Unfortunately, more often than not, after preparing the financial statements or the forecast, closing the cycle, and assuming everything was done, we realized the next month that the numbers changed because somebody, somewhere, in some plans had changed one number, consequently impacting everything! Instead, today,\u00a0thanks to Board's status tracker cockpit, we can always monitor how planning is going, who is still working, who is ready, and who has any impediment with the planning process.The \"Mother of All Buttons\": Consolidation with one clickHistorically, Coca-Cola European Partners has undergone many mergers and acquisitions, with every entity coming from a different background and bringing its own way of planning and its own business metrics, logic, and methodologies. Using Board, the business can\u00a0automatically perform\u00a0full country consolidation, ensuring data consistency and providing deep insight into financial and operational results. Within Board, Coca-Cola\u2019s teams find a red button labeled 'Approve all', which Ivan explains:We call it that little red button, \u2018the mother of all buttons\u2019, just because it allows us to consolidate in a split second! Yes, consolidation can happen with a single button! Yes, consolidation can happen for 48 manufacturing plants and for 85 warehouses! At the beginning I was very skeptical, but I can guarantee you that it works!Board\u00a0allows the Group to discover crucial insights which drive business decisions and unify strategy, finance and operations. In fact, leveraging the Board platform\u2019s advantages, Coca-Cola European Partners has effectively achieved standardization and data centralization, also enhancing a shared service center and a Center of Excellence in Bulgaria that is responsible for all the data loads and the data inputs. This center can centrally control the whole process of standardized planning, as well as any analysis and reports, from one location for all the other countries in which Coca-Cola European Partners operates.Behind the Scenes: Data transparencyThrough rapid development time, Board has given Coca-Cola European Partners an effective combination of automation and standardization, including automatic forecast generation. This has been a digital revolution, achieved by the alliance of methodological principles with outstanding technology:It\u2019s not a single application that can start a revolution; rather it is the blend of all the applications we have developed on the Board platform, together with its architecture, its flexibility, and its advanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) as well. Board has given us the efficiency that everybody was pursuing and that management wanted to see in the entire planning process.But this kind of project could not be achieved without a solid data baseline: optimization, efficiency, digitalization, and automation is just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface there are other benefits to consider, such as data transparency across the full decision-making process, as Ivan discusses:When I say that Board ensures our company data availability and integrity, I\u2019m not merely talking about the traditional idea of \u2018garbage-in, garbage-out'. I mean the capability to empower the organization with a sustainable process that provides the data on time and in good quality.How to engage everyone in the company and drive the change: Ease of use and communicationWhen a relevant change is introduced in an organization, it is fundamental to actively include all those concerned. In this way, the implementation is likely to succeed and be well received by people throughout different departments and hierarchies. As Ivan highlights:You need to know your crowd to be able to implement such a transformation quickly and be strategically aligned. Absolutely all stakeholders within the company must be aligned to what management would like to achieve\u2026otherwise the roadblocks could be quite big.Alongside technical support during project management,\u00a0the ease of use and flexibility of the Board platform has helped Coca-Cola European Partners to effectively and smoothly adopt the new solution, From the end-user standpoint, Board's integration with Excel and the rest of the Microsoft Office package \u2013 traditionally embedded in every finance function \u2013 has made user adoption even easier. Additionally, finance applications now are directly maintained by the finance team itself, independent from the IT department. \u00a0Board's embedded workflow functionality has enhanced visibility among Coca-Cola European Partners' employees and senior management teams, both at the country level and at the overall European level. On the same platform, the company can now monitor any manufacturing plant, warehouse, logistics processes, and cold drinks operation for every single Country. On the very same platform, the management team can control the progress report of all the plans and forecast submissions coming from all the European countries. This effective combination of a detailed view and a 'big picture' translates into better user adoption and addresses the management team's need to keep a close eye on the activity of the workforce.People within the company have also appreciated the technical performance of Board, such as its speed and the user-friendliness of the cloud base. Ivan concludes:We have a lot of central teams and local teams in the countries and everyone can recognize the benefits of Board for the company. All users are now integrated within the same platform. Thanks to Board we can address the full planning scope, not only part of it, not only monthly reporting, etc. Absolutely every user that has one role in the planning cycle is already engaged with the Board platform. That allows us to promote communication across the entire organization, so that we can effectively drive the change.The content and views discussed in this case study represent the information shared by Coca-Cola European Partners during the BoardVille event on Monday 14th\u00a0May 2018."

        "title": "Digital Finance Transformation at KPMG Germany",
        "company": "KPMG Germany",
        "content": "(WRITTEN IN 2018)KPMG is a corporate network with a headcount of more than 207,000 across 154 countries. It is one of the leading audit and consultancy companies in Germany, with around 10,700 employees based at over 20 locations. KPMG's services include the divisions of Audit, Tax, Law, Consulting, and Deal Advisory.Audit focuses on auditing the annual financial statements of organizations, Tax covers the tax advisory activities of the business, \u00a0Law combines legal expertise and specialist knowledge in a global, full-service law firm, and the Consulting and Deal Advisory areas provide high-level technical expertise on business, regulatory, and transaction-based topics.KPMG specializes in cross-divisional topics for key sectors of the economy, combining the experience of experts from around the world to further enhance the quality of its advice.The Challenge: Preparing the finance function for the futureDigitization and the workplace of the future are today's shape-shifters for every sector and division. They come with some extreme challenges and risks, but they also offer enormous opportunities for companies and employees.In 2016, KPMG\u2019s finance team launched the Finance 2020 program to address future requirements and shape the role of finance in the company. The scheme deals with increased process automation, radical process optimization, and a repositioning of the division's role which is shifting towards a skilled, engaged, professional, and objective Finance Business Partner.Accepting the new landscape in 2016, it became clear which obstacles in the planning process needed to be overcome to implement this ambitious transformation:High procedural costs: Employees considered previous planning processes to be over-technical and complex. There was a feeling of constantly being stuck in the planning process.Lengthy approval processes: Planning processes always required strong personal exchanges and numerous rounds of discussions. Due to the level of detail and process dependencies, steering-relevant information always seemed to come too late.Top-down or bottom-up planning: There was a need for flexibility in planning. It was not possible to combine top-down and\u00a0bottom-up planning.Obsolete technological islands: Many of the planning documents were created in standalone programs such as Excel and PowerPoint, preventing any rapid exchange of information. The opportunities for new technologies in the field of planning were not fully exploited and the existing systems landscape had met its functional and capacity limits.Individual calculations: Different departments often had a different planning focus, which again made it difficult to standardize and unify plans across the business. The widespread planning landscape created a lot of work in terms of testing interfaces and migrations.Throughout the planning process, there was too much focus on the detailed recording of financial figures. For example, any budget deviations could only be analyzed after a comprehensive gathering of facts in intensive exchanges with the specialist departments. As a result, decision-relevant discussions would often come too late. This was also the case for the forecast process, which focused on the detailed collection of quantitative information twice a year. A number of resources were involved in the collection, coordination, and evaluation and this lengthy process meant that there was little scope for control options until the discussion of content and clarification.To design a solution that would overcome these shortcomings and act as a reliable platform for the future, the Corporate Controlling (Planning) team started looking at what they wanted from a planning landscape. The result was a list of key points on which the future-oriented system architecture should be based, which helped to form the requirements for the new solution:Top-down and bottom-up planning: Flexible and agile planning and planning strategies require a combination of top-down and bottom-up planning approaches.Simulation: By integrating value driver models and supporting predictive models, different scenarios can be played out as early as the planning phase.Automatic approvals: The future solution had to support and guide the coordination processes in the best possible technical way.Full integration: By fully integrating the planning tools into the existing system landscape all the planning processes can be interlinked in the most effective way.Ad-hoc reporting: A high level of instant data availability was needed for flexible, modern, and agile reporting, so reporting data could be consolidated without delay.The Board Solution: A single intelligent platform to cover all requirementsTo meet the requirements described in the target situation, KPMG began a structured selection process to evaluate a variety of providers. In addition to the above requirements, it was important to also map out the redesign of the overarching processes:\u00a0\u2022 One-touch planning: The future system had to enable the existing process structure to be streamlined and standardized. A coordinated process chain was to be implemented, which involves a one-off planning stage for each decision level, from strategic corporate planning through to market-processing strategy and detailed cost planning.\u2022 Early warning process: An early warning process had to replace the current forecast process. This would significantly reduce the planning workload and increase the control capabilities of management levels. This is where topic-based planning comes in; based on the year-end result this would identify problem areas more quickly so countermeasures could be developed in a timely manner. By cutting the number of KPIs in line with target values, workload could be reduced significantly while workrate could be increased, embedding the process into the company's monthly reporting.In terms of technology, KPMG wanted to set up a single point of content that bundled all financially relevant planning processes together, based on a standard solution. The purpose of the finance team\u2019s ownership of the project was to unite design and system development into one in addition to bundling specialist and technical expertise. This concept would make it easier and faster to implement new system requirements with a more specialist foundation.\u00a0KPMG identified the Board Intelligent Planning Platform as the potential solution to its challenges. In a successful POC (Proof of Concept), Board managed to model all of KPMG\u2019s process, design, and planning requirements in a compacted form within 2 days. The moderate project costs meant KPMG could easily predict and justify the project risk. Board had also already been successfully implemented within the KPMG global network in Switzerland and the Netherlands, which made the decision easier.The project team rolled out Board to 100 users as a pilot project from December 2016 to September 2017. The planning modules were designed, developed, and built to customer specifications, with the functions for migrating between the system landscapes and the backup system specially developed for KPMG. KPMG Germany also had access to internal teams of experts who were able to support every aspect of the Board design and implementation.\u00a0The Benefits: Greater efficiency, flexibility, and visibility in financial planningThe Board solution reflects KPMG\u2019s target planning landscape and was a significant factor in the Corporate Controlling (Planning) team meeting its operational goals. The system is used primarily for performance management (budgeting, planning & forecasting, profitability analysis) and to discover crucial and actionable insights.The system-based collection of qualitative data and digital control for transparent approval processes has significantly increased the speed of planning activities. The option to comment on plans and forward them to other people and departments, in line with the agreed processes, increases employee productivity and frees up time for staff to get more involved in content analyses and grow into a Finance Business Partner for all the divisions.\u00a0The simplicity of the Board application and the easy setup of new planning templates and reports, without any in-depth IT knowledge, brings the planning tools closer to the specialist departments and allows the experts to quickly and qualitatively analyze the data. Its extensive planning functionality (with flexibility for top-down and bottom-up planning), simple consolidation, and ad-hoc progress reporting also improve the quality of planning as a whole. In summary, this means that employees spend less time on administrative duties. Due to the standardized, streamlined, and integrated processes, KPMG can make relevant information available at a much faster rate.\u00a0As a result, KPMG has come closer to its goal of creating a planning system landscape that is perceived at all levels as an enrichment rather than an obligation, and is now exploiting all of Board's interactivity and data prognosis capabilities. A largely automatic planning system has emerged, which guides the user on a clear and simple path through the planning processes, minimizing the workload and allowing only vital tweaks to be made where necessary. Employees can also use predictive approaches and modern forms of data prognosis.As one of the leading consultancy firms, KPMG has these tips for other companies implementing similar projects:Consider a POC (Proof of Concept) solution. This is the best way to formulate your core requirements in detail and to try out the system for your individual requirements.Define a clear target image and set precise project goals! It's the only way to successfully implement ambitious projects.Focus heavily on your project team and use the expertise and experience of external colleagues. This will contribute significantly to sustainable and long-term project success.\u201cWith the help of Board, KPMG has come closer to its goal of creating a planning system landscape that is perceived at all levels as an enrichment rather than an obligation, and we are now exploiting all of its interactivity and data prognosis capabilities,\" concludes Ralph Schatten, Head of Controlling, KPMG AG Auditing Firm"

        "title": "Streamlining Sales Planning at GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy",
        "company": "GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy",
        "content": "GSK is an international research-based pharmaceutical company with a truly special mission: to help people live longer, healthier, more active lives. The company consists of three main global business divisions dedicated to researching, developing, and manufacturing drugs, vaccines, and innovative healthcare products respectively.Listed on the London and New York stock exchanges, GSK has operations in Italy where it makes a substantial contribution to generating value both locally and for the fabric of the national economy.In the pharmaceutical sector, the group has an extensive portfolio consisting of innovative drugs and major classic brands, with revenues of \u00a317.6 billion. In the vaccines sector, GSK has an extensive portfolio and an innovative pipeline aimed at protecting people of all ages, across more than 160 countries, and generates revenues of over \u00a37.2 billion.The new GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy, formed in 2019 by the merger of GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy and Pfizer Consumer Health, is dedicated to the development and commercialization of wellness products and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. On the strength of a portfolio of iconic brands, such as Multicentrum, Polase, Sensodyne, Voltaren, and Polident, it generates revenues of over \u00a39 billion.GSK Consumer Healthcare in Italy has its headquarters in Milan and a production facility in Aprilia (in the province of Latina), and is:No. 1 in Italy\u2019s over-the-counter drugs and Consumer Healthcare marketNo. 1 in Italy\u2019s Oral Care marketNo. 1 in Italy\u2019s food supplements market.The Aprilia plant is one of the group\u2019s flagship sites because it is one of GSK's biggest production facilities worldwide, producing OTC drugs, food supplements, and probiotics. The plant operates with a workforce of over 400 staff, a production capacity of over 100 million packs per year, and more than 400 SKUs. 90% of the Aprilia plant\u2019s production is for the EMEA Region.\u201cAt GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy, we are committed to building a company based on five key qualities:\u201d explains Vincenzo de Renzis \u2013 Sales & Business Development Manager, GSK Customer Healthcare Italy\u00a0\u2013 \u201ca growth mindset, aimed at developing ever more value, both for the business and for people; an agile approach, that can adapt quickly to customers\u2019 requirements; a close focus on execution, in line with the group\u2019s strategy; and a digital heart, based on the opportunities offered by data analytics and digitized information assets to underpin effective decision-making. But the pivotal point around which all this revolve is the customer, consumer, or patient.\u201dHarnessing the trends of digital transformation in one, user-friendly environmentTo achieve its mission and to stamp these five key qualities on its business processes, GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy wanted to evolve its Customer Business Plan (CBP) with a unified solution capable of managing and controlling both forecasts and actual data relating to volumes, revenues, promotions and trade spending. The aim was for the CBP solution to be a strategic tool utilized by the Field Force and Headquarters to create, manage, and display customer business plans in the form of complete annual budgets.\u201cGSK Consumer Healthcare Italy already had a CBP solution, but \u2013 before the advent of Board \u2013 this was based on a whole range of disparate spreadsheets,\u201d recalls Vincenzo de Renzis. In fact, the CBP process used various Excel worksheets for each phase, from the management and control of information on product volume & values, to product expo/displays phase, and the new product listing phase.de Renzis continues, \u201cThere were just too many exchanges of Excel worksheets going on between process stakeholders \u2013 consultants, account managers, and colleagues at headquarters \u2013 \u00a0and this took up a huge amount of time every month, carried a high risk of error due to the manual consolidation and alignment of data, and resulted in insufficient transparency and information-sharing between the parties concerned.\u201dGSK Consumer Healthcare Italy\u2019s management had set itself the goal of simplifying the CPB, in order to free up more time for value-added activities, by cutting time spent on creating macros and dealing with tools and Excel files. To this end, the project managers benchmarked their \u201cExcel-based\u201d CBP against the opportunities the world of technology and innovation was offering businesses:\u201cWe realized that, with the \u201cold\u201d CBP, we were unable to follow key trends that were accelerating digitalization and bringing innovation to every modern sector of industry. I\u2019m talking about four aspects in particular: Big Data, which makes it possible to understand and predict the behavior of customers and competitors more quickly; technological capabilities, which open up highly advanced analysis options; the simplicity of applications, which are becoming ever easier and more intuitive to configure and manage; and the security of the IT infrastructure and architecture, which is both more robust and less costly,\u201d explains de Renzis.GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy also considered Gartner\u2019s FP&A Magic Quadrant with a view to identifying the solutions best matching their financial planning and analysis needs. Before long, they were increasingly leaning towards Board, requiring a platform that was both robust and flexible on which they could easily replicate the logic of the CBP while enjoying all the benefits of the latest technologies. In order to achieve full control of performance alongside the FP&A solution, the software selection managers evaluated other vendors in Gartner\u2019s BI Magic Quadrant:\u201cThis was when we noticed that the only vendor that had the same platform in both the FP&A quadrant and the Business Intelligence quadrant was Board! Following a series of local and international assessments, involving various business functions and with the support of our partner SDG Consulting, we therefore opted for Board,\u201d explains de Renzis.Integrated Sales Planning & Analysis\u201cYou can think of the Customer Business Plan in Board as an interactive \u201ccontainer\u201d of processes that takes the form of integrated sales plan & analysis. Starting from three basic processes, i.e. defining the baseline of volumes and pricing, the part dedicated to promotions and expo/displays, and the part on new products, Board creates a profit & loss account by customer and product,\u201d explains de Renzis.Initially, the planning cycle is fed by a startup determined by the site (Commercial Excellence) and the input of key account managers, who each enter their own plans. The next stage involves an exchange of information with an external trade promotion management application \u2013 which provides Board with the actual data of the promos \u2013 and with the group\u2019s enterprise report planning.\u201cBoard also potentially communicates with the customer sell-out applications, and with any other type of information source relevant to our sales planning process,\u201d adds de Renzis. \u201cThanks to a multiple-planning model and its advanced features, Board is used by GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy in way that cuts across all our channels as well as the various process stakeholders within the organization.\u201dGSK Consumer Healthcare Italy competes on the market through two main channels: the mass market, i.e. major retail chains, including OTC pharmacies in shopping centers (Wellness & Corners); and the dispensing pharmacy channel. The company is gradually developing integrated planning for both of the main channels, including all the channels that the pharmacy sector is divided into, from pharma chains to independent pharmacies; wholesalers to cooperatives; and all the remaining channels, such as online players and hospital pharmacies.\u201cFor us, each channel or sub-channel is a self-contained planning model that we manage and monitor on Board, thanks in part to the platform\u2019s flexibility. But at the same time, we manage to keep all these models so as to standardize our processes on the basis of a single point of truth, by conveying the information into a single database that we then use to conduct analyses and make decisions and forecasts,\u201d explains de Renzis.The Board solution takes a fully-fledged Integrated Business Planning (IBP) approach, which, as de Renzis points out, has the following main benefits for GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy:IBP becomes the driver of business decisionsThe process is collaborative and increases information transparencyPlanning is more effective and there are fewer unforeseen issuesThe sales forecast calendar is aligned with the business planning calendarForecasts of all channels are unified into a single planning process, on a single platform.On this point, de Renzis notes:\u201cThanks to Board\u2019s customer-based planning with IBP approach, the interaction between the functions has undoubtedly improved, thanks in part to the greater visibility of information, which is available to each profiled user at all times, according to their role. In the past we had to draw upon different sources and then deal with the difficult task of trying to knit the various sales forecasts together. But now, with Board, we have taken out the complexity: all the channels are unified into a single tool, and the alignment of sales forecast scheduling with the business planning calendars has enabled us to streamline the deadlines for all the stakeholders in the sales process. All this has increased the percentage of business targets that we are achievingIf we take a closer look at the CBP process implemented with Board at GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy, we can think of it as being divided into four key steps:The first step involves defining the initial parameters, i.e.: customer hierarchy, product pricing, input of contracts and setting sales targets.The second step is dedicated to product volumes, including the input of new ones: \u201cOur company is committed to releasing new products onto the market on an ongoing basis, so it is essential for us to have a CBP tool that enables us to manage the volumes of products that have been launched in the reference year,\u201d explains de Renzis.In the third step, the volumes are valued, taking account of promotions and investments. The last step is reporting, which includes analyses and reports on customer revenues and profit & loss for the entire year, promotions, spending control, including an analysis of Return on Investment (ROI), and assessments and comparisons of various business scenarios, including comparison of the forecasts submitted by sales key account managers during the year.Sales key account managers directly determine the volumes and promotions, the data for which can also be consulted by stakeholders in demand planning and supply chain, as well as by the finance team.The reporting part has been made accessible to everyone: the CBP application in Board was designed according to a \u201csegregation of duties\u201d approach, where every business function can view all of the information but they can only modify it if their user profile allows them to.\u201cOne of the most significant and useful reports we have created with Board is the Promo Intensity Index & Distribution report,\u201d \u00a0continues de Renzis. \u201cBy inputting the key sales account managers\u2019 promotional plans, we can represent the impact that promotions have, or will have, on sell-out in terms of promotional intensity.\u00a0 This means we identify the weighted points of groups of customers planning to launch certain promotions in specific periods and \u2013 by comparing this representation with the one for the previous year \u2013 we collaborate with the marketing area to work out where to focus the effort of campaigns, external communication and advertising.\u201d In summing up the benefits that Board has brought to GSK Consumer Healthcare Italy, Vincenzo de Renzis was keen to emphasize the fact that the Intelligent Planning Platform, \u201cCombines two features that are rarely found together in the same tool: power and flexibility. Board can be adapted to both current and potential needs and is scalable according to the new product portfolio and new business logic. And at the same time, Board is a stable, reliable, high-performance platform.\u201d"

        "company": "Hapag-Lloyd",
        "content": "With 235 modern container ships, a transport volume of 11.9 million TEUs (standard containers) per year, around 12,800 employees in 399 offices across 128 countries, and headquarters in Hamburg, Hapag-Lloyd is one of the\u00a0world\u2019s leading liner shipping companies.\u00a0The company\u2019s fleet has a total capacity of 1.6 million TEUs and its container stock, of around 2.5 million TEUs, features one of the largest and most modern collections of refrigerated shipping containers of any shipping provider.\u00a0The Challenge: Making complexity more manageable\u00a0Each year, 119 of Hapag-Lloyd\u2019s own ships, plus a similar number of chartered vessels, transport\u00a0almost\u00a012 million containers to more than 600 different ports. Add to this the coordination of the corresponding feeder and pick-up traffic over land and the complexity of the challenges faced by the 400 staff involved in planning at Hapag-Lloyd is clear.\u00a0Managing logistics on this scale requires a perfectly coordinated planning process. The basis for this is an annual bottom-up planning activity, which also inputs into a strategic five-year plan due to capital requirements. This basic process takes about three months and is supplemented three times a year by budget and forecast planning. There is also a monthly update to account for short-term trends.\u00a0The process starts with operational planning, followed by sales planning which is supported by driver-based cost planning. At the end of this process comes financial planning and analysis (FP&A), which involves sending Excel sheets to as many as 128 countries around the world. Merle Remmel, Director of Controlling at Hapag-Lloyd, explains the challenges associated with this process:The consolidation of this data is\u00a0very time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially since not all employees send back the Excel files in the specified formats and templates, meaning they must be reworked manually.As part of a digitalization initiative at Hapag-Lloyd, the need to introduce a system that would perfectly\u00a0support employees in these complex planning activities\u00a0and\u00a0accelerate the entire planning process was identified. A project team was put together, which, together with key stakeholders and experts from celver AG, analyzed the existing planning process to determine what was essential to maintain and which areas could be optimized and improved with the support of an appropriate system.\u00a0\u00a0The team worked out which points in the planning process were causing the biggest problems and at the same time defined its direction to ensure future requirements would be met. This resulted in the following project goals:\u00a0\u00a0Increase the level of\u00a0automation and flexibilityRetain\u00a0driver-based planning capabilities\u00a0to enable adjustments to be made with ease and to reliably calculate the resulting outcomes of these adjustmentsKeep the number of employees involved in the planning process the same, based on their importance in\u00a0ensuring buy-in and commitment to the agreed planUpdates to planning based on short-term trends should, if possible, be rebuilt into a\u00a0rolling forecast\u00a0to enable the estimation, at any time, of what the financial outcomes will be at the end of the year\u00a0The Board Solution: High compatibility with upstream and downstream systems\u00a0Thereafter, the project team dealt with the selection of an appropriate system, exploring the Business Intelligence market, solutions already used in the company, and speaking with experts. Hapag-Lloyd carried out small pilot projects with eligible vendors and the best solutions were subsequently examined through a proof-of-concept. The providers were then compared in a rating matrix and presented to the management team, who jointly selected the future Business Intelligence system \u2013 Board. Merle highlights why the decision was made:In addition to industry expertise and an excellent analyst ranking,\u00a0Board was capable of being integrated very well into the existing system landscape.Once implemented, the benefits of Board in bringing together data from across the business were soon realized, as Mathias Sch\u00e4fer, Senior Director IT at Hapag-Lloyd, explains:The upstream systems that provide the raw data are SAP and proprietary systems from Hapag-Lloyd. Board links the data of both systems via SQL Server and forms a\u00a0single-point-of-truth (SPOT) for the planners worldwide.In addition, the Board SAP Connector, which ensures a proven and secure connection to the SAP data, is used for some data provision. Both the headquarters and the regions can\u00a0access the same accurate, reliable data. The worldwide Controlling and Sales teams can view it directly in Board, add their own data as required, and partial extracts can be exported from Board to Excel by simply pressing a button. This enables employees to use and share data in the known system while ensuring the\u00a0consistency and transparency\u00a0of the data is maintained.\u00a0When implementing the system, in addition to the flexibility and ease of use of Board, its short development times came to fruition. Together with celver AG as the implementation partner, the project team has already created and rolled out more than 20 planning masks\u00a0with Hapag-Lloyd\u2018s look and feel, despite the tight schedule and extensive requirements of the project in the first six months.\u00a0Mirko Sch\u00f6mann from celver AG discusses the project:The challenges were very complex. Linking and processing data from different feeder systems with different structures in such a way that they fit together and are comparable was a real mammoth task. The high level of detail of the planning process and the large number of departments and planners involved added another level of complexity.In the end, the excellent cooperation between the Hapag-Lloyd project team, celver AG, and Board made a huge contribution to the timely release of the large planning application.\u00a0Customer Benefits: Perfectly linked Capacity, Sales, and Cost Planning\u00a0Henrik Schilling, Managing Director Controlling at Hapag-Lloyd, provides more detail about the planning process:About 50 capacity planners, 200 sales planners, and 150 cost planners are working on the complex planning activities at Hapag-Lloyd. Of course, their plan sizes are very different. That's why the trade manager, who plans the capacities, needs to know which orders are required to optimally plan routes and capacities.This creates a very complex voting system between sales planners and trade managers, but since both groups now always have the\u00a0same reliable data in Board, the voting process\u00a0has been considerably simplified. In addition, the system allows users to drill down to individual routes for detailed analysis.\u00a0Driver-based cost planning is also linked to sales planning with raw data coming from the SAP system. All cost aspects such as container type, cooling, geo-hierarchy, or contract type are recorded and directly linked to the container quantities. Here, too, drilling down to the detailed information offers\u00a0maximum transparency\u00a0for the planners, as Henrik highlights:Today we can\u00a0automatically calculate an exact price\u00a0based on the number of containers and the cost per unit, so do not have to resort to average costs.Board has also delivered several other benefits, meeting the goals defined at the beginning of the digitalization process. The\u00a0lead time of the individual planning steps has been significantly reduced, as has the workload for the individual employees. This in turn contributes to the continued strong buy-in of employees. The new system makes it possible to\u00a0automate repetitive tasks\u00a0and steps to a greater extent and still create greater\u00a0flexibility, while the introduction of the rolling forecast helps to\u00a0keep the end of year results in focus at all times.\u00a0Merle summarizes the project's status:In this first implementation phase the focus was on planning. In the next phases, we will also look more closely at the topics of reporting and dashboarding. For example, we want to implement financial reporting with the integrated commenting functionality. For management, we plan the creation of\u00a0dashboards\u00a0and the mapping of\u00a0current KPIs\u00a0directly on screens, tablets, and smartphones.When asked what he takes from the initial project as a 'Lesson Learned', Mirko has a clear answer:\u00a0It is very important to involve the departments in a timely and comprehensive manner and, above all, to include them in the design of the planning logic and screens. This avoids many change requests and speeds up implementation considerably.With this project, Hapag-Lloyd has begun its journey to reposition Finance and Controlling within the company. For the medium-term controlling strategy, the company has defined three clear messages:\u00a0Pace over perfectionEveryone on board\u00a090-day heartbeat\u00a0It is the departure to new a new world, in which \u201ceveryone on board\u201d means, quite literally, just that.\u00a0"

        "title": "Integrated Financial Planning & Analysis at Volkswagen Mexico",
        "company": "Volkswagen Mexico",
        "content": "One of six Volkswagen manufacturing plants around the world, Volkswagen Mexico employs around 13,000 people\u00a0at plants in Puebla and Silao. The division produces the Volkswagen Jetta, Golf, and Tiguan as well as engines and components for a wide range of other vehicle brands owned by Volkswagen. The plants, now covering more almost 3 million m\u00b2, have been operational since 1967.The Challenge: Inflexible, labor-intensive finance processesUntil 2015, Volkswagen Mexico's finance department relied on multiple Microsoft Office-based applications to produce its annual plans and develop the key financial milestones for the company\u2019s operations.Those applications, which had been created mostly in Microsoft Access Databases, flat files, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and manual connections to other related systems, were inflexible, disconnected, and unsecured. Producing financial plans and analyses relied upon time-consuming and error-prone manual processing and integration. Planning process cycles required many hours of manual work that could often\u00a0contain deviations on numerical calculations, introducing costly errors that could lead to confusion and a potentially inaccurate basis for the company\u2019s planning and KPI monitoring activities.The Solution: A fully integrated approach to financial analysis, planning, and forecastingTo alleviate its technical and business pains, VW Mexico decided to find a flexible FP&A software solution on which it could implement a Management Intelligence strategy that would allow planning activities to run smoothly, automatically, and more efficiently than they did with the current legacy processes.After an extensive review of potential enterprise software vendors for Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) and BI reporting, including Oracle, IBM, SAP, and Qlik, VW Mexico chose the Board Intelligent Panning Platform, which offers smarter planning, actionable insights and better outcomes in one, user-friendly environment.VW Mexico cited superior functionality within the Board platform, including its flexibility, data analysis capabilities, and technical infrastructure for virtual hardware, as the primary reasons behind its selection.The Board platform\u2019s self-service approach enables VW Mexico's business users to easily develop and reconfigure applications by dragging and dropping elements into customizable reports and dashboards. Its tight integration with Microsoft Office products provides users with the same look and feel they are accustomed to working with in Excel, helping to increase the speed of adoption.The Benefits: Increased financial accuracy and efficiency from a range of financial applications built within the same platformIn the first year after deploying the Board Platform, VW Mexico successfully developed and launched financial planning applications for its Marginal Contribution Calculation program, Integration programs, Input Consolidation, Variation Analysis, and Reporting.Marginal Contribution Calculation is a cost accounting concept that allows VW to determine the relative profitability of each product and line of business of the plants in Mexico. The metric allows VW to evaluate different areas of the business to determine which parts to emphasize based on the highest margins or the differences compared with the last financial planning cycle for any given part. With the Board-based applications, the company can now accurately determine the composition of its income and cost integration for each product and business line.VW Mexico\u2019s Integration Application automatically collects and consolidates data from numerous end-users in Mexico, financial information from SAP FI (Finance Module), and data from global systems in Germany to give the company and users a single point of truth on which to conduct all analyses and simulations.Other applications VW has developed on the Board Platform include Input Consolidation, Variation Analysis, and Reporting. Input Consolidation allows each business owner to input their data and release it to other systems in the company through strong business rules and validation processes. Variation Analysis gives business users a broad view of the data and calculations to help them to fully understand conclusions and provides numerical explanations for any differences between planned finances and actual results.For reporting, the company now has more than 20 standard reports to deliver information to the VW Headquarters. For custom reports, end-users now have a strong multidimensional Board database to create ad-hoc reports by intuitively dragging and dropping elements, resulting in huge time reductions and ensuring consistent quality and accuracy as they are drawn from a single data source in the Board platform. Board's flexibility also enables ad-hoc reports to be created easily with the same high degree of accuracy, and all reports give readers powerful drill-down capabilities to provide greater context and help users understand the underlying data.Volkswagen Mexico\u2019s Office of Finance reports that since Board was implemented, the tremendous improvement in processes, accuracy, and visibility in the finance strategy, combined with cost savings and improved accuracy of data for planning, has reaped an increase in overall efficiencies from 57% to 91%.\u00a0"

        "title": "Operations Planning Transformation at KFC",
        "company": "KFC UK",
        "content": "Back in 1930, the success story of the KFC Group began with a simple petrol station in Kentucky, US. Today, KFC is part of Yum! Brands, the world's largest foodservice group, serving from over 23,000 restaurants in approximately 135 countries. The first foreign branch of KFC opened in Preston in the United Kingdom in 1965 and was the first American fast-food restaurant chain in the country. KFC UK now has over 900 stores employing 24,000 people.The Challenge: Time-consuming, spreadsheet-based planning processesGood planning is crucial to the company's success in the fast-food business, where reaction speed and the ability to adapt quickly to changing consumer trends is essential. As KFC grew, so did the planning requirements, and the initial Excel-based planning system consequently needed to be updated. This was because KFC's restaurant operations required the planning of sales, resources, and many different variables such as electricity, uniforms, and security. Data drawn from different sources and the manual preparation of that data in Excel files made the planning process at KFC a very time-consuming and potentially error-prone business. In particular, subsequent changes and planning scenarios were an extremely cumbersome and labor-intensive process due to the many variables that had to be adjusted in Excel following even a minor change in the targets.In order to address the shortcomings of the current planning process, KFC decided to implement a tool for integrated restaurant planning. The business developed a concept for the modeling and implementation of corporate performance management to optimize planning processes.After a thorough software evaluation, it became clear that Board was the best fit for KFC's planning requirements, especially because of the platform's ease-of-use and fast data processing and evaluation time. A central data source (Single Point of Truth), as well as integrated calculations of the main drivers and KPIs, was to be created in Board to automate planning processes as much as possible. The ability to easily and quickly make changes to key assumptions and drivers, which used to take days to implement across all the Excel sheets, was also a key target of the project.To unify and improve the process of the software implementation, and react faster to problems and/or errors, Board partner Better Decisions Group (bdg) proposed an agile project approach.The Solution: Integrated Business Planning on BoardWhat used to be a complex, intertwined plethora of Excel sheets that were more or less connected to each other was, one by one, transferred into a single, integrated planning solution within Board. Starting from planning sales, all the corresponding variables and drivers, from labor requirements down to uniforms, were integrated in an automatic process that calculated the numbers based on a coherent logic, while still allowing the planning team to make changes at any point, if required.\u00a0Within a short time, bdg set up an integrated restaurant sector planning solution which was ideally suited to KFC's business requirements. In addition to support and maintenance, the Board partner provides support for customizing and extending the solution. Thanks to effective user and administrator training, the KFC team can now independently control its planning solution and optimize processes.The Benefits: A significant increase in planning efficiency\u00a0The duration of the planning cycles was shortened substantially with Board, while at the same time improving quality and enabling easier auditing; all information is now consistent and runs together in a single data pool. Duplication in processes was significantly reduced by implementing a central, integrated planning logic across all planning modules. This way, changes in key assumptions, e.g. an uplift in sales overall, can now be calculated through all drivers in no time - a process that happens frequently during planning and which used to take days. Also, this gain in time, quality, and level of detail has made it possible to experiment with strategic simulations whilst maintaining depth of detail.About bdgBoard partner Better Decisions Group (bdg) is an international business consultancy for Corporate Performance Management and Business Intelligence solutions. With over 13 years of experience in the field, bdg works closely with a variety of organizations on the improvement of decision-making, from system conceptualization to post go-live support.\u00a0"

        "content": "Located in Kuching, East Malaysia, Naim Holdings Berhad is an investment holding company with two main subsidiaries, Naim Land Sdn. Bhd. (NLSB) and Naim Engineering Sdn. Bhd. (NESB). The group operates as a fully-integrated property and construction enterprise, focusing on:integrated property developments combining residential, commercial, and industrial properties with infrastructure and public amenitiesconstruction, civil engineering, oil, gas, and infrastructure projectsoil and gas services through investment in Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd.Naim Holding's flagship property developments are Bandar Baru Permyjaya in Miri, Desa Ilmu in Kota Samarahan, and the up-market Riveria satellite township in Kuching southern corridor. These developments are reinforced by a number of smaller residential and commercial developments in Sarawak's major population centers. Together, these developments provide more than 25,000 homes and commercial buildings with a combined population of over 110,000. Including implementation of NLSBs own development projects, it has carried out more than RM5.8 billion worth of construction works and has an order book worth over RM2.8 billion. The company focuses on excellent quality and timely delivery, a philosophy that has earned Naim Holdings a host of industry awards.The challenge: Spreadsheet-based budgeting and planning is too complexNaim Holdings has been using spreadsheets to input, store, and consolidate company data. When the company grew, the increasing number of spreadsheets that came with it made comparing figures and producing reports tedious. As such, they started searching for a tool that can effectively provide professional budgeting and planning. The company identified and compared three possible tools from the market: Board, Clarity Systems, and Hyperion. Board stood out as the best choice for several reasons:Users from other departments who are not well-versed in IT can easily navigate and work on the systemBoard's flexibility and scope enable customization of profound management reportsComparable cost-effectiveness for setting up and maintaining the softwareBoard's programming-free toolkit allows for Naim Holdings IT Department to easily perform software development on their end at their own time and pace.\u00a0The solution: Board provides a user-friendly, standardized approach\u00a0Due to Board's user-friendliness and power-packed training sessions, the IT Team at Naim Holdings successfully implemented the following modules in their Board application:Manpower PlanningOperational CostsProfit and COS Recognition for the trading business sectorProperty Sales and Cost Budgeting ReportingCash FlowComprehensive IncomeRevenue & COSNo. of Units SoldSales ValueFor them, Board has become the central budgeting and planning tool providing readily retrievable information and strong daily administrative support. After the initial stage involving the transfer of information and processes from the various departments and subsidiaries to Board application, users promptly filled in whatever missing information was required and the system was promptly kept up-to-date. Depending on the user type, they are empowered to create new projects or statements which are yet to be included in the source system. With this feature, managers can introduce new real-time measures whenever higher management makes changes to existing policies. The versatility of Board enables a string of different reports to be produced with the same type of data. This data, once input into the application, is extremely secure and at no risk of data loss.The benefit: Significant time savings and real-time dataIn a fast expanding property and construction company like Naim Holdings, using the Board application is significantly more efficient and time-saving than Excel spreadsheets. The multi-user interface of Board also allows different users to work and update information at the same time. This results in increased productivity across company employees.Due to its automation and customization processes, Board has fewer consolidation and calculation processes which are also less complicated. The resulting ease of computation not only minimizes human errors and mistakes arising from linking two or more modules but also enables the speedier regeneration of reports for business plans that have changed.The IT Team continues to make changes to their Board application in response to future needs and for greater value added to the company. The company is now looking to make a list of developments, including:Introduction of Property Investment Business Planning moduleAdmin Expenses BudgetCapital ExpenditureIntroduction of HR moduleHeadcount data inputsStaff Cost data input.Based on the comments gathered from users, plans are in place to introduce the above alongside the existing modules."

        "title": "Resource Management & Cost Analysis at MLB Network",
        "company": "MLB Network",
        "content": "Founded January 1, 2009, MLB Network is an American television sports channel dedicated to baseball. It is growing to incorporate other sports like hockey by adopting the National Hockey League\u2019s (NHL) digital properties in 2015. The channel\u2019s headquarters and studios are in Secaucus, NJ. As of February 2015, MLB Network was available to approximately 69,991,000 paying television households (60.1% of subscription television customers) in the United States.The Challenge: Costly and time-consuming data management and reconciliationWhen MLB Network first launched at the start of 2009, it employed 50 people managing a 4-hour rotation of baseball shows and live games. The 50 people quickly grew to 1,000. Throughout this journey, Paul Ramos, Director of Financial Planning & Analysis, struggled to track the activities of each staff member, turning to Excel and manual SQL data entry to try and reconcile the data with payroll.Over the next two years, the Network continued to adopt manual processes to manage its growing staff and expanded business hours. By developing a cost-efficient staff utilization method, MLB can take on more and more production businesses. As the organization expanded, so did its need for a better system to track journal entries, payroll, and show costs.\u201cBefore Board, we had to create our journal entries in Excel manually from our folio system,\u201d Paul shares. \u201cWe were able to do it before when we had about a couple hundred people, but when you\u2019re talking about close to 4,000 people per day, seven days a week, every day of the month, trying to book $200 million of labor on an annual basis becomes almost impossible.\u201d\u00a0The Solution: Flexible and adaptable financial analysis and reportingAfter evaluating several financial planning platforms, MLB Network chose the Board Intelligent Planning Platform which offers smarter planning, and actionable insights in one, user-friendly environment. Board\u2019s ability to bring the company\u2019s multiple data sources into one solution, and the flexibility it provides to grow alongside the Network, were crucial factors behind the decision. \u00a0G7 Tech Services, one of Board\u2019s partners, worked with MLB Network to deliver its current Board platform implementation and position the business to be self-sufficient. MLB Network also wanted a step up in the industry, and G7\u2019s experience and specialism were well-suited to this. Together, the two companies formed a successful partnership.G7 took an agile, phased approach to working with MLB Network and its data to ensure the Network is set up for continued success as it worked independently within the Board platform. The key to this joint success is communication; after mapping out a plan and connecting data, the two companies constantly touch on testing, performance assessments, and improvements.The ability for Board to support MLB Network\u2019s granular reporting has also been a huge competitive differentiator. As Paul reports, almost no other production company goes down to the day level.\u201cWhen we have conversations with other production companies, they are usually just going down to the month and week levels; we go down to the day and are working towards getting down to the hour and minute. It allows us to charge out the minimal amount to our sister companies and it makes us more competitive against other production companies. When other companies invite us to work with them, we can charge the most accurate prices because we are able to literally pinpoint exactly how much things cost, with nothing extra. This is a valuable tool for us,\" says Paul.The G7 team has enabled MLB Network to add more detail to its custom Board reports, making it easier to pinpoint and correct business issues without the need to search for information.\u201cWe\u2019re very happy we found G7 and it\u2019s been working out phenomenally. They\u2019re great at thinking outside of the box,\u201d says Paul.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPaul and his team have a lot of things on their roadmap, so together we created a phased project plan,\u201d shares Odeta Pine, Founder and CEO of G7 Tech Services. \u201cWe invited Paul and the team to actively test the solution and make sure things were working properly within the business. We wanted to hear what was good, what didn\u2019t look good, and we\u2019d go back and make those fixes. We made sure that all the parties were involved together across these processes.\"The Benefits: Granular analysis and faster month-end closeOne of the most significant advantages to MLB Network is Board\u2019s flexibility to integrate different types of data and easily allow the business to grow and absorb more entities, resulting in:One integrated solution for tracking multiple data and calendars, managing over 20,000 shiftsImproved staff utilization and cost savings of approximately $6,000,000 to $8,000,000 worth of laborEnhanced budget analysisStandardized method for managing business entitiesReconciliation process down from 1 week to 4 hoursEasy and flexible growthOne integrated solutionIntegrating its shift and financial data into one system has enabled MLB Network to centralize financial reporting and establish data confidence internally and\u00a0for the third-party entities it services.\u201cBoard was the only system that allowed us to take both the headcount and positions into one place and continue to measure them differently,\u201d says Paul.\u00a0This provides the flexibility and adaptability required to meet MLB\u2019s specific needs, enabling the Network to keep all data tied together in one system and produce in-depth reports with detailed variance analysis.Within the same system, MLB Network can also maintain multiple calendars for the two sports it currently manages production for: baseball and hockey. The ability to manage these seasons in Board has enabled the team to slice and dice information across all 20,000 shifts they oversee throughout the year, across both sports\u2019 seasonal calendars, providing comprehensive insights. \u00a0Improved staff utilizationGiven that the baseball and hockey seasons run back to back, the Network can utilize its staff throughout the year, saving approximately $6,000,000 to $8,000,000 worth of labor. Previously, staff was not used well during the offseason: taking vacation time, working half days, etc. The Board platform made it easy for the Network to bring in the National Hockey League (NHL) and staff the season using existing resources and technical infrastructure. MLB Network continues to take on new opportunities like this, with Board saving the business more money and providing a platform for increased success and visibility across the industry. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cBaseball is looking at us as that's where we're going to send all our production arms, that's where we\u2019re going to send all our tape shows, and it's going to go on and on. We're happy because we're growing and at the same time our staff is being fully utilized. There\u2019s no downtime, no seasonality, and we get to save baseball millions of dollars and again prove our worth, and so much so that they're letting us buy other buildings to expand for next year,\u201d says Paul.\u00a0Enhanced budget analysisOne of the most appealing and valuable aspects of the Board platform for MLB Network is its ability to take capsules of unrelated information to finance, such as employee shift numbers, and integrate them into the overall financial number.\u201cToday we tie together over 20,000 shifts a month containing staff names, IDs, job roles, and tasks worked on and completed. In Board, I can tie all the details to my financials in a simple way that everyone understands. Not only can I give production a financial number, but I can also add a lot of depth to the report by providing information about headcount, job positions, and show data. I couldn\u2019t do that at all without the help of Board and its capsules because it allowed us to take data that had nothing to do with financials and then tie it back in to track it and reconcile it,\u201d says Paul.\u00a0Within Board, MLB Network can report at a very granular level, all the way down to the hour that a staff member worked, to analyze staff utilization and better schedule for the future. This allows external entities to receive key insights about staff, cost efficiencies, and payroll needs to make informed decisions about the future and how they can best allocate their resources. Paul and his team use historical data and trend analysis to recommend how to use freelance staff in the best possible way. The data also gives insight into what equipment is most cost-effective to use, what rooms will work for the show needs, what rate cards would be appropriate for positions, and more.\u201cBy tying all my systems together, we can have a conversation that has payroll implications, shift implications, and even conversations that lead to someone getting a promotion,\u201d Paul adds. \u201cWe can use this for multiple purposes, and we are going to tie it to even more systems and get even more granularity.\u201dBy measuring both headcount and positions down to the granular shift-level within Board, MLB Network can efficiently analyze budgets and pinpoint the root cause of variances exactly.\u201cWe can see right away if we\u2019re over budget or under budget because we can go down to the day, the shift, and the person that caused the budget to go over or under. This is invaluable, and without it we couldn\u2019t prove our utilization,\u201d shares Paul.\u00a0Standardized methodologyThe Board platform fits perfectly into MLB Network\u2019s continued growth and acquisition model because it allows easy expansion and replication of applications and methodologies. This enables the Network to jumpstart new projects quickly and provide immediate value to clients.\u201cThe Network itself is growing so large and so fast; this solution allows me to almost play with it. I can try this or add that,\u201d exclaims Paul. \u201cWe continue to add more; we just absorbed the multimedia arm of baseball, at the same time we're doing things with Facebook, YouTube, and DAZN. We keep adding more, and we have plans to grow even more and it fits.\u201dShared reconciliation processIt\u2019s a priority for MLB Network to close out months as quickly as possible. With Board, the business has achieved a short run time to perform reconciliation and is well on the way to getting the process down from days to minutes. Reconciliation would previously have taken one week, but a month can now be closed out in 4 hours because custom reports in Board produce precisely the data required for analysis, as Paul explains:\u201cInstead of having to run 15 different packages for all our different businesses and then drill down to see what the error is, we built the reports to spit out almost immediately and then those variances literally glow on the page. We can see what the problem is, what the difference is, and it saves my financial analyst time from digging.\u201dThe team also saves two weeks of incorrect scheduling and stays on budget by identifying problems in near real-time. By spending up to 10 days to close the month, any active scheduling issues are identified too late, causing two weeks of inaccurate scheduling and negative budget ramifications. Now, the team is on top of staff schedules and charges in near real-time, allowing them to identify problems much sooner or even before they happen.\u201cWe get two weeks back before that becomes a bigger problem. We save money that way, and we\u2019re not just closing and collecting information earlier, but we\u2019re actually stopping issues anywhere from 7 to 10 days earlier,\u201d Paul adds.The G7 team also enabled the Network to run information on-demand, producing refunds in just minutes. Previously, the process was more manual, with the team needing to run files across different systems and then upload them into Board. With the additional system connections, the team can quickly press buttons and pull information in, cutting back on days of reconciliation work.Easy and flexible growthBoard\u2019s flexibility has enabled MLB Network to grow within the platform itself, making it seamless and easy to acquire new business without recreating financial models. Each time a company comes to the Network asking if they could take on new work (such as adding the entire production facility of MLB\u00a0 or absorbing the tape programming schedules), the Network can easily say yes. This is because it can quickly track and manage multiple entities from within one financial system.\u201cAll we kept doing was adding capsules and blocks into Board to keep track of all the different entities and roll them up into one financial package. I kept everything within the system the same and just compartmentalized all the additional businesses that we added. Except for Board, there was no system out there that could do that. Board has literally allowed us to grow without the growing pains,\u201d adds Paul.\u00a0The Future: Making way for more business with custom reports and additional integrationsMLB Network has been pleased with Board\u2019s flexibility and how it fosters its continued growth within the production industry. As the business continues to grow, so will the custom reports it creates in Board. The company also plans to integrate Board across more business areas, tying in critical systems and making Board the central system to gain actionable insights.\u00a0\u201cWe can use Board for multiple uses, and we are going to tie it to even more systems and get even more granular,\u201d Paul adds.\u00a0It\u2019s an exciting time for MLB Network, as the organization builds new facilities to expand its infrastructure and become equipped to take on more business.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a want for what we provide, and we know that we\u2019ll be able to do that in the future years as we expand, and Board is a big part of that,\u201d Paul concludes.Paul and his team have a long wish list of things they want to do with Board, including adding another payroll module, payroll planning, revenue planning, automation of other finance processes, updates, and Oracle integration. \u00a0"

        "title": "Procurement Planning Transformation at Acea",
        "company": "Gruppo Acea",
        "content": "The Acea Group is an integrated multiutility company that manages and develops networks and services in the water, energy, environment, and energy infrastructure sectors. Acea is a\u00a0public company\u00a0\u2013 the public sector has a significant influence on its operations in industrial and commercial nature\u00a0\u2013 operating in special sectors such as natural gas, thermal energy, electricity, water, transport, ports, airports, and postal services.\u00a0Acea Group is the top Italian operator in the water sector, with around nine million inhabitants served\u00a0in central and southern Italy,\u00a0and a vital player in Italy\u2019s energy sector, with approximately 7.1 TWh of electricity sold to 1.4 million customers. Acea is also\u00a0a leading Italian waste-processing operator.Acea's business vision is built on sustainability. Sustainable development is a key structural element that steers the group's business decisions and operating management.Acea has chosen to centralize the purchasing process at the parent company. This process is overseen by the purchasing function, responsible for\u00a0sourcing suppliers (from a pool of around 1,600 active businesses) and leading negotiation phases that lead to contracts being drawn-up and finalized.\u00a0Clorinda Pavoncello, Head of Planning and Control in Acea's purchasing and logistics area explains:Our purchasing center operates for both the parent company and all our subsidiaries, of which there are more than 20. The center is responsible for providing governance across the remaining investees. We operate based on demand from the companies based across Italian territories.\u00a0Acea manages around 3,200 orders and framework contracts for works, services, and supplies with a value of approximately \u20ac1.1 billion. This comprises a catalogue of 158 product and service categories.The purchasing process begins with a purchase request issued by the operating company that formally sets out the characteristics of the contract or order.\u00a0The process is fully digitized and once the requests have passed through the approval process, they are delivered directly to the purchasing function in the relevant category area. This is done through an automatic routing system that looks at the classification of the request. The responsible buyer then begins the negotiation phase with suppliers or initiates tender procedures. They manage and monitor the process until a contract is entered into and signed by a fiduciary with a specific power of attorney.The purchasing process only involves the Purchasing & Logistics (P&L) function during the operational phase; the phase of preparing documents and making appendages is handled entirely within the operating companies.\u201cWe gradually realized that there were some limitations keeping us from meeting our group's expectations efficiently,\u201d comments Clorinda.\u00a0She continues:The buyer was only engaged when the purchase request had already been formalized and submitted to the P&L function. Requests were processed one at a time, so there was no big-picture perspective at the group level. Additionally, because we were often only engaged during the execution phase we were prevented from guiding the company to define the characteristics of the requested product or service. This somewhat limited our ability to take advantage of contingent market opportunities.This limited visibility of the company\u2019s needs meant it was not possible to formulate long-term plans and so Acea were not always in a position to apply the most advantageous purchasing strategy.At certain points of the year, impacted by the inevitable dynamics of each season, there were recurring periods of peak demand that held up our processing queues and extended the time required to issue contracts. In addition, where documentation, sent over by the operating companies, needed to be added to or modified, processing times became even longer and the risk of falling behind planned schedules increased,\u00a0recalls Clorinda.\u00a0She continues:In short, we had an 'executed' approach, where we could only start working on a request when the buyer came to us. This meant not having any opportunity to interact with the company at all, during the process of preparing supporting documentation, and not being able to adapt the timing of requests to be more optimal and use available resources more efficiently.We therefore started thinking of a proactive approach that would consist of planning phases over a well-defined period, one that aligns across all Acea\u2019s operating companies. Before implementing Board at Acea, these opportunities for coordination were difficult to put into practice\u00a0because stakeholders in the purchasing process were committed more to day-to-day operations. They were unable to dedicate extra time to analyzing, forecasting, and spreading knowledge throughout the organization between HQ and the companies. Combined, this translated into a lack of a common strategy.Selecting the best software: Streamlined implementation and strong usabilityTo address the issues identified above, Acea initiated a\u00a0software selection process. The first stage was to identify and set the\u00a0evaluation criteria to identify the best solution on the market. These were divided into two general categories:Project CriteriaAn extendible platform\u00a0(including the possibility of using\u00a0plugins\u00a0from various applications available on the market)Adherence to cloud compliance legislationPresence of an \u2018update and release\u2019 model for\u00a0new releases\u00a0of the softwareA business-oriented solution\u00a0that ensures users are independent from the IT department and the vendorAn adequate\u00a0implementation timescale.Functional CriteriaVersioning\u00a0integrated directly into management planningThe possibility of establishing a\u00a0procurement planning process, including authorization management workflowHigh score on the\u00a0System Usability ScaleFunctionality for user\u00a0profilingKPI led measuring. \u00a0Acea required a solution that would provide these characteristics on an\u00a0integrated, shared, and easy-to-implement platform. Clorinda notes,The Board platform was the program that obtained the highest score in our analyses, conducted by both the IT department and the Acea purchasing function - She adds - We then contracted design and implementation of the process through a tender. The process was efficient because we were able to modify the design of the application that we had in mind even while work was in progress, so to speak, until the launch of the full-fledged pilot project.Planning and analysis through an intelligent, nine-step workflowThe purchasing planning and analysis solution built in Board consists of\u00a0three integrated macro-areas\u00a0that all use the same datasets. This ensures complete, reliable, and consistent information; a single version of the truth. The three areas include:Procurement planningAnalytics to support day-to-day activities (which includes a document and inventory analysis function)Performance assessment and KPI setting/monitoring.After designing the purchasing planning model to embrace the each area, Acea Group broke the model down into three phases, which involved various stakeholders across the business. Chiara La Marca, Acea Purchasing Planning Manager for Acea, explains:During the first phase, when purchasing needs are expressed and validated, the main actors included the group's requesting companies, Acea executives from HQ, and the main procurement teams. All purchasing needs are reported by the operating companies to Acea's purchasing function who then collaborate to drive the subsequent formalization of the procurement plan.\u00a0Board allows the actors involved in this phase to apply filters and systems to support analysis, accessing historical data and receiving the needs proposal and key dates as an automatic output \u2013 drawing on the historic databaseIn the second phase, after the needs have been analyzed and consolidated, selection procedures are defined and the purchasing plan, including verification of feasibility, is formulated. At this point of the process, the stakeholders shift to planners and category managers of the purchasing function. They remain, however, in close collaboration with the operating companies who can modify or confirm the procurement plan proposal.\u00a0During this phase -\u00a0comments Chiara - a fully-fledged purchasing strategy is finalized that works in conjunction with the various procedures and available labor force. Pro-active steps are taken to modulate work peaks in collaboration with the operating companies.In the final, third phase, Board provides the operating companies with a schedule of purchasing requests to be submitted, setting deadlines to prepare the technical documentation by and finalize the requests.The purchasing planning process has been formulated according to a workflow that is divided amongst the various owners of the various phases (the group's operating companies, the procurement planners, and the category managers). As Board users, they all have access to the Intelligent Planning Platform and can review, via an intuitive graphical interface, whatever they need. This transparency gives everyone the ability to check or view the status of each item to be processed, from start to finish, and makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues or share information with management across all teams.Chiara goes into more detail,The workflow we have set up in Board consists of nine preliminary steps. In the first step (purchasing planning), we start the process by setting parameters that apply on a cross-company level, shared by all operating companies. The operating companies come into play in the second to fifth steps to establish local parameters which are attributable to each company. This may include things such as the settings relating to the group-product-object in the procurement plan. In this way, we can normalize the data.Board then prepares any requirements specific to each company.\u00a0Within Board, ACEA\u2019s subsidiaries can manage purchasing requests in terms of scheduling when the relevant technical documents need to be presented to the Purchasing Area.The sixth and seventh steps of the procurement planning workflow return to the responsibility of the purchasing officer and the penultimate step (eight) involves the category managers who consolidate the purchasing plan:During this phase Board again proves truly valuable as, thanks to the overview of all purchase requests in their purview, category managers are able to implement a far-sighted purchasing strategy, analyzing the workload and any foreseen or foreseeable peaks and resource availability, with a comparison to historical data -\u00a0explains Chiara.As a result, Acea can efficiently distribute the fulfilment of purchasing requests over the full year, noting each company's needs and, \"Drive significant collaboration between the various teams to enable them to pool their experience as buyers,\" as Chiara adds. She continues,This way, they can design optimal strategies for concluding certain contracts or scheduling activities, without having to interfere excessively with other transactions. Now, with Board, we can view and analyze volumes together, even when they originate from requests at different times. We benefit from significant competitive advantages in tender procedures and can present higher volumes of work.Each category manager formulates their purchasing plan and proceeds to the final, ninth phase where Acea HQ checks the process has been executed properly and validates it.With Board, Acea also has a section dedicated to analytics, perfectly integrated with procurement planning. Chiara comments:The analytics constructed in Board support day-to-day-operations. We use a document sub-section for outstanding contracts, framework contracts for adjustments, ongoing purchase orders, and so on. Analysis is visualized across a series of screens, highlighting all relevant data from Acea's transaction systems. For example, in the ongoing contracts screen users can monitor the fulfilment state of active framework contracts (such as those expiring or nearing financial completion, and so forth), visualizing key information with a specific color scale for user ease.Procurement planning and analytics are also linked in an area dedicated to KPI-based performance assessments. This environment utilizes the same datasets used for purchasing planning and analysis.Once a planning system is set up, Acea put measures in place to ensure that planning follows the processes set by the organization. This means having an evaluation function that can accurately determine the degree that the operating companies are following the procurement plan. In doing so, each company has accountability for their operations, can be informed about their performances, and can view transparent data that will highlight any divergences from the plan and the consequences in doing so.Harnessing Board's revolutionary potentialGiven the strong benefits Acea have seen using Board in terms of success, effectiveness and transparent information, the group has decided to soon employ other Board features. These include:simulation and predictive analysisBusiness Intelligence (BI)reporting capabilities inherent to the platformintegrated planning and analytics.We are already pursuing four approaches to further expanding Board at Acea,\u201d - comments Chiara -. Through Board we want to emphasize an agile approach already tried in working methods, between the HQ's centralized purchasing function and our \u2018local' operating companies. We also want to move towards constant improvement of our procurement planning process \u2013 a goal that is now easier to achieve thanks to the flexibility of the platform of Board. By leveraging the platform\u2019s modelling and simulation functionalities, we intend to use the program to generate increasingly detailed predictions, integrating them with the goals of the investment plan. Finally, we are harnessing Board's BI spirit. By extending operating reporting via Board, we are allowing users access to a broader set of data that is aligned and functional to the activities specific to each person's role.Clorinda concludes - The Board platform obtained the highest score in our assessment, conducted by both the IT department and the Acea purchasing function. Implementation was efficient, as we were able to change the application's design even once it was up and running \u2013 all the way to our go-live."

        "company": "Mega Lifesciences",
        "content": "Since 1982, Mega Lifesciences (Mega) has helped millions of people gain access to safe, effective, world-class medicines. The company is a leading participant in the health and wellness sector for developing countries, with over 80% of its activities based in Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Nigeria.Mega develops, manufactures, markets, and sells nutraceutical, prescription pharmaceutical, and over-the-counter products under the Mega We Care\u2122 brand. It also has a distribution division, Maxxcare\u2122, which markets, sells, and distributes various prescription pharmaceutical, over-the-counter, and FMCG products.The Challenge \u2013 Finding a solution to meet wide-ranging marketing requirements: budgeting, planning, analysis, and reporting Mega\u2019s marketing budgeting process involves two key documents: the Marketing Annual Plan and Brand Annual Plan. Each include qualitative aspects that are tied into the numbers but captured as part of the marketing planning process. At the \u2018pre-budgeting\u2019 phase, each of the brands in Mega\u2019s portfolio are placed into one of four categories: Eliminate, Maintain, Raise, or Create.\u201cWhile Raise is more incremental, Create might be more of a paradigm shift,\u201d explains Arun Singh, CIO at Mega Lifesciences. \u201cAnything in the Eliminate or Maintain category, you know your marketing campaigns and spend has to be within the check. For Raise or Create brands, you can be more aggressive with the spend. Once these high level strategies have been defined for each brand, there is a check on the numbers that follow. Do they fall in line with the categorization, or not? It doesn\u2019t make sense that you plan to Eliminate a brand but you are increasing the marketing spend by 50%. Having this qualitative aspect captured, along with the numbers, gives you that overall perspective and you know there is a rationale behind the numbers you are entering.\u201dThough the company has a clear vision of how marketing performance management should be conducted, it has a very diversified operation spanning 30 countries, and each had developed its own approach. Two countries were using a legacy software solution while the rest were using Excel. A previous attempt to standardize activities by rolling a marketing budgeting solution out to all locations proved difficult as the system did not support the hybrid approach needed to combat unstable internet connections in developing countries. It was also more of a data entry system than driver-based planning solution, leaving users feeling like they were taking a step backwards.This experience gave Arun and his team helpful insight into what the business really needed out of a marketing budgeting system. Arun explains:\u201cWe failed, but we learned. We learned we needed an intuitive system, an offline system, a cloud-based system that is optimized for internet-based access, a system that takes care of both quantitative as well as qualitative aspects, and one platform for the entire range of marketing processes. We also realized we needed to provide users with something very intuitive, to give that Excel-like experience, but also ensure automation and integrity, and reduce, rather than increase, their work.\u201dA business intelligence (BI) project, undertaken by Arun\u2019s team, provided further insight into the company\u2019s software requirements. After implementing a standalone BI tool to visualize marketing data, it was clear that extended capabilities were required if marketing budgeting and forecasting was to be effectively integrated into the process. The vendor relied on external partners to bring in budgeting and write-back capabilities but was unable to replicate its BI success in this area due to limited integration and support capabilities on the planning side.At this point, Arun\u2019s team was armed with lots of insight but was still trying to figure out what kind of solution would meet all of their requirements, bringing together marketing budgeting and planning, analysis, and strategy management.\u201cWe had sky-high expectations,\u201d Arun continues, \u201cWe are very inquisitive, and our users are also very demanding. We had been learning and taking note of all of these requirements, so we knew the problem very well, and, eventually, we were able to give a name to this beast that we are trying to tame. That beast is called Enterprise Performance Management (EPM). It was such a relief when we discovered there was a type of solution that would address our needs.\u201dThe Solution \u2013 A single platform for marketing performance management and analysisWith the type of solution identified, Arun\u2019s team began searching the EPM marketplace. They explored several options, but the challenge was finding a solution that could effectively combine strategic, financial, and operational aspects in one. \u00a0\u201cThen, we received an invitation to a Board seminar in Thailand. Our team went there and came back with a brochure. One day, I had the problem clear in my mind, and when I started going through the brochure, I could see all my check boxes being ticked,\u201d says Arun.The Mega team contacted Board\u2019s Singapore office, who proceeded to deliver a Proof of Concept using the company\u2019s own data.\u201cThe team did a very good job of creating the initial Proof of Concept, which was given to us free of charge. The quality of the job that was done was very impressive, including the amount of detail and attention the team brought to the table. They were really stepping into our shoes. The Proof of Concept was well-received by all our stakeholders, and that\u2019s how we decided to engage in the next step,\u201d Arun continues.The Implementation \u2013 A phased approach to achieving 360\u00b0 visibility of marketing performance and fully integrated marketing planningMega is currently in the implementation phase of Board, breaking the transformational project down into three key stages, as Arun explains:\u201cPhase 1 is about getting the marketing budgeting numbers. Phase 2 is getting the marketing strategy. Phase 3 is starting to get all the marketing analytics we want to bring in. For any particular brand, we want a 360\u00b0 analysis of what the numbers are, what the strategies behind them are, and then advanced analytics for those brands. Everything in one single platform. That\u2019s the objective. A marketing planning and analysis platform. Board doesn\u2019t only do budgeting, it\u2019s also a BI tool. That\u2019s the end game for us.\u201dPhase 1 \u2013 Marketing BudgetingThe first phase of the Board project will focus on the delivery of a new, more flexible marketing budgeting solution, overcoming the limitations of Mega\u2019s legacy system on which activities can only be performed at granular SKU level.\u201cOne size does not fit all,\u201d says Arun. \u201cSome countries would rather budget at a brand level, or initialize at the category level first, starting from macro level and going down to micro level. With Board, we are in the process of building this. We have been able to identify multiple templates, so you are not restricted. If you want to do budgeting at brand level, you use the brand template. If you want to do it at the SKU level, you use the SKU template. If you want to do your budgeting with the quantity first, and you want the value to be calculated, then do it with the quantity. We\u2019re building a whole pricing model in Board, where, if you enter your quantity budget, your value will be calculated. Another country might be more comfortable performing a value exercise, and in this situation, the quantity is automatically calculated, based on the pricing. So you have all these different possible combinations.\u201dPhase 2 \u2013 Marketing strategy managementOnce the core marketing budgeting activities have been transformed, Mega will focus on using Board to incorporate strategy into the marketing planning process through a driver-based approach. Board will enhance this activity by providing instant insights into the effect of different strategic drivers on the marketing budget and forecast.\u201cWe realized that any good performance management system should not only have provision to enter your numbers, but also capture your strategy. Driver-based planning drastically reduces the work for the user, as you can use the history with a driver such as growth percentage, and your budget is immediately initialized. Then you can go and tweak your numbers,\u201d says Arun.The Mega team has perfected the marketing processes for its brands and produced a brand \u2018toolkit\u2019 containing 50 different templates. The aim is to make these templates available in Board, allowing users to select them as required when creating the budget for each brand, tied in to the numbers. Once this has been completed, Phase 3 will focus on introducing advanced marketing analytics to provider greater insights for decision-making.Arun concludes by summarizing the overall goal for the transformative project:\u201cWe are moving from quantitive to qualitative plus quantitative. Numbers plus strategy. Just like Board promises. We are actually doing it! So the way we envision Board is not just an Excel replacement, or an automated grid where you can punch in your numbers, but our bigger vision here is that we want this to become our single platform for marketing planning and analysis. That\u2019s the long-term goal. We realise this is not going to happen in a year or two. This is a long-term plan, and we are very optimistic about what Board can do for us.\u201d "

        "title": "Enterprise Performance Management at Groupe SEB",
        "company": "Groupe SEB",
        "content": "Groupe SEB operates in nearly 150 countries with a unique portfolio of\u00a034 leading brands, including\u00a0Tefal, Rowenta, Moulinex, Imusa, Lagostina, and Rochedo. Each is marketed and sold through a multi-format retail approach. Since its creation, the Group has been a key player in everyday revolutions thanks to its innovative products which change the daily lives of consumers all over the world.The story of Groupe SEB began in 1857 with the creation of the Antoine Lescure company in the Burgundy region of France. Starting life as a tinware business specializing in buckets, watering cans, and kitchen utensils,\u00a0the company took a major stride forward in 1953 when it launched the pressure cooker,\u00a0giving it a new national dimension and changing a fundamental habit of the French people: the way they cooked.Groupe SEB deploys a long-term strategy focused on innovation, international development, competitiveness, and service to clients.\u00a0Philippe Martelo, Director of Finance Information Technology at Groupe SEB, shares more:Today we are the world reference in Small Domestic Equipment, being the number one in various different product categories and in numerous geographic areas,\u00a0and we aim to\u00a0be the global benchmark in our Industry.\u00a0Our purpose is\u00a0to make daily life simpler and more wonderful for consumers\u00a0throughout the world, by creating new products and services that meet people\u2019s current needs and anticipate their individual aspirations and desires. I think these aspects of our purpose, as well as our mission to create lasting value by making strong profitability a priority, are\u00a0something we share with Board International!The Challenge: Legacy planning and reporting systems creating unnecessary complexityAs with most businesses, Groupe SEB faced challenges in its performance management activities, including raw material price volatility, market and distribution consolidation, the emergence of disruptive business models, and the acceleration of changes within the industry. SEB had dedicated substantial resources to budgeting and forecasting, but its processes were manually intensive, lacked agility, and were not always strategically aligned.The Group's management reporting system was based on SAP BW. It focused on historical data, lacked simulation capabilities, and did not support users in their budgeting and forecasting processes. The system also suffered from slow response times, poor ergonomics, and did not provide quarterly views of data. In addition, SEB's performance reporting processes were quite rigid, did not feature workflow management, and would often produce irrelevant results. There was a clear need to simplify these processes and introduce more flexibility and relevance, as Philippe highlights:Our pre-existing reporting system, based on SAP BW, was complex and included a lot of analytical dimensions and axes that were difficult to feed, resulting in a time-consuming process. The tools were designed for experts; therefore\u00a0our Finance users could not gain autonomy from the IT Department.\u00a0As\u00a0we must cope with increasing volumes of data, the previous system hampered flexibility, as well as lacking the planning and forecasting capabilities to control, handle, and properly make the most of our big sets of data.\u00a0We were suffering from the 'heaviness' of the system and its complexity, which became functional limits and technical shortcomings.\u00a0The executive committee was starting to complain about the rigidity of our processes:\u00a0it\u00a0was time-consuming to calculate our standard costs, make updates related to a change in the volume of our factories, and so on.Overcoming all these obstacles using\u00a0the company's legacy systems would require\u00a0heavy investment\u00a0and long-running projects which would utilize too many resources. As a result, SEB decided to embark on a\u00a0new project\u00a0with the objective of overcoming these challenges in an Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) solution on top of its SAP BW reporting system. The EPM solution would\u00a0bring agility to the process\u00a0and\u00a0encompass the Group's strategic plans,\u00a0allowing it to apply the Agile approach, as Philippe explains:For us, the Agile approach was important because we needed to implement a flexible solution.\u00a0In the traditional approach the quality is so-so; you never meet your budget and you never meet your deadlines. Instead, with the Agile approach, your variables are no longer the calendar or your means\u00a0but the scope\u2026 and you always meet your objectives!The Selection Process: Searching for one platform to build many applicationsThe robustness of Groupe SEB\u2019s management schemes, master data, reporting processes, and tools provided the opportunity to confidently introduce a lighter and more flexible Enterprise Performance Management solution; one which was\u00a0straightforward, user-friendly, intuitive, visual, and would provide more agility, increased speed, and state of the art reporting.The main business priorities of SEB\u2019s project were:Smart Reporting:\u00a0Existing reports were fragmented due to the evolution of business needs and the poor performance of the existing SAP BW system, so the new reporting solution had to provide\u00a0fast access and user-friendly navigation to full reporting data.Weekly Sales Report: The objective here was to enable Groupe SEB to have a\u00a0consolidated vision\u00a0of its total revenues for the next six months,\u00a0updated on a weekly basis.Strategic Orientation:\u00a0The new solution needed to support the production of the group's\u00a0five-year plan, providing an application which would generate P&Ls by Product Lines and\u00a0Geographies at different hierarchical levels, in line with historical data. It was also required to support data entry, workflows, versioning, data consolidation, and cost allocations on different axes with different keys.Operating performance: The EPM solution had to provide a multidimensional waterfall, isolating scope, currency effects, and price/volume/product mix, etc. in relation to the operating results.The Enterprise Performance Management solution had to replace the current BW reports and support decision-making processes by creating plans, budgets, forecasts, and re-forecasts based on monthly, quarterly, yearly, and multi-year visions. On the same EPM platform, Groupe SEB needed to perform simulation and business modeling, related to purchase price, absorption of fixed costs in the plants, and what-if scenarios.After a review of the market, the decision was made to choose the Board Intelligent Planning Platform. Philippe explains the decision:Starting from a set of eleven vendors, we compared the Board platform to six EPM solutions on the market and concluded that it is the most complete, powerful, and easy to use product. We\u00a0wanted to bring value to very specific aspects,\u00a0enhancing the capabilities of multiple solutions and seamlessly combining them within the same platform.Finance Agile Smart Tools (FAST): The Board projectThe transformational project was given the acronym FAST to represent its purpose. Philippe highlights the desired outcomes:Using the power and ergonomics of\u00a0Board\u00a0through an Agile approach, the key objectives were to\u00a0increase flexibility, allow\u00a0simulation capabilities,\u00a0and progressively build up a\u00a0finance toolbox\u00a0made of\u00a0smart, dedicated, user-friendly solutions.The core of the Board project at SEB is represented by the above-mentioned\u00a0Strategic Orientation\u00a0solution and is based on the company\u2019s matrix structure, as Philippe explains:Group SEB simplified org. chart presented at Boardville, May 15, 2018.We have three main\u00a0Strategic Business Units (SBUs) \u2013 Cookware, Kitchen Electrics, and Home & Personal Care\u00a0- that are mainly dedicated to Strategic Marketing and Product Development.\u00a0Their role is to imagine the products of tomorrow and develop them, manufacture them, or buy them from outside the group. These SBUs are regarded as Cost Centers - instead of profit centers - because they sell their products internally to\u00a0Sales Geographies (Continents, Areas, and Markets)\u00a0where there is a SEB sales presence\u00a0organized by product lines or families. These products, in turn, are the responsibility of local teams, who develop them under the supervision of the relevant SBU.The first level of SEB\u2019s business model is structured across two main axes - Product and Sales Geography - with secondary axes for brands, production sites, marketing, and development.Strategic Business Planning\u00a0is built up throughout the entire organization.\u00a0The process starts with the proposal of a baseline Actual and Budget P&L\u00a0by the Corporate Function\u00a0(including aspects such as OpEx and Sales Growth)\u00a0to help build a five-year plan. The SBUs then draft their own plans to fit with the proposal (such as R&D and product launches).In the past this strategic plan was managed using spreadsheets, creating an error-prone process.\u00a0Due to the rigidity of Excel files, the teams across different markets struggled with control and management of OpEx and other measures they received from the previous phases of the planning processes.\u00a0With Board,\u00a0we have the possibility to effectively define strong ownership.\u00a0Now, everybody is responsible for their own expenses, and if you sum up all the numbers and measures, you get the right operating result of the group.\u00a0It also means Corporate, SBUs, and Continents cannot change the expenses of the different markets.In particular, if we focus closely on the initial phase of the strategic planning process, we find out that\u00a0the\u00a0simulation capabilities of the Board platform\u00a0are used by Groupe SEB to feed three cubes, by re-processing the data baseline relating to the previous 10 years of historical data.\u00a0Based on the above-mentioned axes or dimensions of the company (such as Product family, Market, Product Line, or Area), SEB builds up one simulation cube at Corporate level, one at SBU level, and one at Continent level to release a five-year business plan. Philippe continues:We apply Board's simulation capabilities to the data baseline because \u2013 of course \u2013 our product categories have changed over the years, and also due to the inclusion of new brands in our portfolio. Therefore, it is important to have a consistent view of the past to plan for the next five years.\u00a0The corporate function initializes the business modeling process, with specific assumptions regarding the growth of the expenses of the group and the sales goals. Then the SBUs present their R&D pipeline and the products they are about to launch. They also provide their own view of sales and of their business across the different geographies. Finally, the continents take the lead, completing the process by providing the final version of the strategic orientation.Alongside the Strategic Orientation solution, Groupe SEB has implemented an activity it refers to as\u00a0Smart Reporting. The business has overcome the previous reporting process\u2019 fragmentation by delivering more than 800 SAP BW reports in Board. Now, every report which has been created, or is going to be created, in SAP (including new ones such as cash-flow forecasting or re-forecasting) is instantly transferred to Board too, and in some cases these reports are created directly in Board.Within the reporting process of Groupe SEB, a solution the company refers to as the 'Weekly Sales Report' stands out on the Board platform, as Philippe explains:Thanks to this solution created within the Board environment, we achieve the consolidation of the Weekly Sales Estimates of all our 150 subsidiaries around\u00a0the world. Every week, each subsidiary provides the management team with sales forecasts for the current and the coming months (up to 6-12 months). These reports show either one figure, or they are broken down into two figures (e.g., by brand and distribution channel, depending on the specific topic we want to follow up). We also aim to progressively\u00a0extend this consolidation to Supply Chain S&OP,\u00a0therefore integrating sales forecasting with operations and leveraging the unified nature of the Board platform.The Intelligent Planning Platform model of Board is suitable for an end-to-end approach that, together with strategic and financial planning and analysis, can also incorporate the operational performance of a complex organization like Groupe SEB. With these capabilities, SEB has implemented a solution it refers to as Result Operating Performance Analysis (ROPA).Philippe continues:We can assess how we go from one year's operating result to the next year\u2019s operating result, isolating several effects.\u00a0Also, we have a specific view of the OpEx, making the distinction between marketing expenses, advertising, and the rest of the structure\u2019s expenses.How Board exceeded SEB\u2019s expectations and produced a \u201csnowball effect\u201dThanks to Board, SEB\u2019s strategic planning activities are now extremely flexible. Geographies can create their plans on the proposed P&Ls\u00a0and \u2013 by default \u2013 P&L OpEx follows the evolution of sales according to trend percentages. Users are able to go back and forth along the process to adjust sales, advertising means, and OpEx amounts.Our planning processes in the Board platform have become collaborative, iterative, and flexible.\u00a0The three versions we get from the simulation process at the strategic orientation level \u2013 Corporate, SBUs, and Continents \u2013 are separate, but\u00a0each team can see the versions created by the others and input their own data according to the others' data.The Strategic Orientation solution is the heart of the Board project in SEB and is highly appreciated by the management team. Among the features of the product they praise most is Board's 'split & splat' function, which makes it possible to distribute and spread every variation immediately, up to its maximum level of detail, providing business users with significant support for interactive simulations.We are particularly happy about Board's solution for strategic planning and simulation, and it is giving us a lot of ideas for the next stages of the implementation and for new applications we aim to create. For example, within that solution, we have added a new feature:\u00a0versioning logic for local scenario management.Supported by the Board connector for SAP, the reporting and analysis processes have also been meaningfully enhanced, producing what Philippe refers to as a snowball effect:Board is our full suite of state-of-the-art analytics services and at the same time a scalable and flexible planning solution that responds effectively to all of our technical and functional requirements. Among the business benefits we have gained through the use of Board, I would highlight what is a kind of \u2018snowball effect\u2019. Now the implementation of new reports is much faster\u00a0and both our office of finance and senior management teams have the\u00a0capability to create new application prototypes or mockups, generating the future tools and solutions that feed our Finance toolbox.\u00a0Besides, Board has empowered us with the capability to reprocess legacy reporting data using our current hierarchies,\u00a0bringing further value by helping us to anticipate future trends.The snowball effect has ensured a fast time-to-solution, increasing Groupe SEB's self-sufficiency in the management, maintenance, and implementation of additional planning applications. This has also been possible thanks to the unique programming-free approach of Board, as Philippe concludes:The\u00a0implementation of the solutions is fast and efficient and our teams are highly motivated to participate.\u00a0We have many projects in mind with Board, which meets our expectations in every way.The content and views discussed in this case study (above) represent the information shared by Groupe SEB during the Boardville event on May 15, 2018. Recent updates to the Board platform use cases are:Evolving Board at Groupe SEBWith Board\u2019s agile Intelligent Planning Platform fully integrated into key planning activities, the organization is looking into other areas of planning and operation to enhance. Existing or plotted initiatives include:Supply chain management with Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP): Groupe SEB integrated Board's platform into Supply Chain Management, optimizing operations and enhancing demand forecasting through Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP).Reducing carbon footprints with Board\u2019s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) solution: Groupe SEB incorporates ESG considerations into strategic planning, focusing on measuring and reducing their carbon footprint using Board's analytics and reporting capabilities.Adapting to shifting transport costs with Board's agile approach: Facing transport price increases, Groupe SEB quickly models scenarios, analyzes impacts, and adapts strategies using Board's Agile approach and simulation capabilities for optimized cost management and operational efficiency."

        "company": "\u00c5 Energi",
        "content": "\u00c5 Energi is a newly formed group following the merger between Glitre Energy and Agder Energi in 2022. The company is now Norway\u2019s biggest energy utility provider positioned throughout the value chain. Hydroelectric power is the cornerstone of its business, with approximately 11.3 TWh generated each year at 72 wholly- and part-owned power stations. It is also Norway's second biggest grid operator, with a 30,000-kilometer electricity network that supplies power to more than 300,000 customers.\u00a0Before the merger: Agder Energi streamlines financial operations with a seamless, integrated system\u00a0Today\u2019s partnership between \u00c5 Energi and Board began in 2018 when Agder Energi was looking for an Intelligent Planning solution that would meet the following requirements:\u00a0support the organization\u2019s vision for a fully established enterprise performance management (EPM) system\u00a0integrate several technological capabilities established in the business\u00a0embed multiple data sources (financial and operational) into one platform\u00a0enable an end-to-end process for financial consolidation activities\u00a0Arve Hildebrandt, Head of Group Governance & Risk at \u00c5 Energi (Head of Corporate Governance for Agder Energi at the time), explained:\u00a0It started off as an exercise to get rid of legacy systems and replace them with new, modern technology. We were able to replace old systems\u2014that were proving to be time-consuming and costly\u2014with Board, where we quickly experienced efficiency gains in consolidation, reporting, and analysis processes. \u00a0The company partnered with K.Group to implement Board across its entire organization, assessing each team's needs and identifying the areas where the platform could provide maximum benefits. By adopting Board, the accounting and finance team streamlined and optimized its consolidation and close processes, eliminating manual efforts and accelerating completion time by ~25% on the Agder Energy operations.\u00a0But the value of Board extended beyond the finance team. The trading and back-office teams utilized the platform for daily status reports, while controllers relied on it for standardized close activities, reporting, and financial planning and analysis. Additionally, managers gained a comprehensive and accurate overview of operations through a single integrated tool, ensuring a unified source of truth.\u00a0An essential aspect of Board was its tailor-made approach for each team. Arve noted:\u00a0One of Board's major breakthroughs was the personalized welcome page and status reports that catered to every management team. When they logged in, they had all the relevant information for their role available on the landing page.\u00a0The platform's user-friendly interface further enhanced collaboration and decision-making within teams, enabling analysis, reporting, and communication to occur in one central location.\u00a0These remarkable benefits translated into impressive outcomes when addressing higher ambitions and business requirements. In comparison to old legacy systems, Agder Energi achieved:\u00a0approximately 50% savings in operational and internal development costs\u00a0a high level of self-service in development activities, resulting in a 60% reduction in external spending on their business intelligence environment compared to how similar development would have cost for legacy systems\u00a0up to 30% improvement in efficiency for various conventional corporate reporting tasks\u00a0a reduction in licensing costs of 40%\u00a0Incorporating Agder Energi\u2019s experience with Board in the merger\u00a0The newly formed \u00c5 Energi group is a complex organization with multiple levels of business entities comprising the enterprise. With more than 50 legal entities and over 500 cost centers providing essential data for business planning needs, analyzing and driving productive plans is essential for business success. \u00a0When \u00c5 Energi merged with Glitre Group, it upgraded its financial consolidation processes using Board. The integration of Glitre's details for financial reporting took less than two months, impressing the new management. \u00c5 Energi successfully added new companies and business areas into Board without requiring significant changes to their existing processes.\u00a0\u201cBoard played a crucial role in facilitating a smooth merger and consolidation process. Our management team had access to group-wide data and results in a very short time,\u201d reported Steffen Syvertsen, CEO of \u00c5 Energi.\u00a0Discussing some of the current challenges facing \u00c5 Energi, Arve Hildebrandt notes:\u00a0Our current challenges are very much around merger activities. We\u2019re bringing in new companies, so new books need to be connected to our charter of accounts, and we see new management teams introducing different business requirements. We\u2019re very much in the transitional period where the old way of steering business needs to transform to a new way. The current challenge is now to bring many of the experienced benefits also into the newly merged \u00c5 Energi.\u00a0K.Group and \u00c5 Energi collaborated closely throughout, with the former using its implementation expertise to establish a clear and manageable process\u2014with Board playing a crucial role in facilitating a smooth merger and consolidation process.\u00a0The results: A closer group with a standardized approach to planning and consolidation\u00a0In addition to the standardization and complete consolidated financial close in the newly merged company, there is likely also a large potential for further efficiency improvements at the end of the currently ongoing transition phase, which the effects proved by the adoption of Board at Agder Energi bare witness of:\u00a0Cost savings: Reduced licensing costs by 30-40% and operational/internal development costs by 40-50%\u00a0Efficiency improvement: Consolidation process streamlined, resulting in a 25% efficiency boost\u00a0Enhanced reporting: Controllers and corporate reporting processes improved by 10-30%\u00a0Time and financial savings: Significantly reduced costs and increased efficiency resulted in overall benefit realization of 30-40%\u00a0Collaboration and standardization: Improved communication, collaboration, and standardization across planning activities\u00a0Centralized information: One source of truth for data, enabling analysis, reporting, and communication \u00a0Better decision-making: Improved management information for more informed decision-making\u00a0Flexibility and customization: Easy customization to meet different demands and support changes in structures and businesses\u00a0Integrated work processes: Seamless integration of work processes and tools, supporting both controllers and management\u00a0Self-service capabilities: Increased self-service for development activities, reducing reliance on external spending\u00a0Hildebrandt summed up his own assessment on the business value of the platform as follows:\u00a0Board is accessible, transparent, and enabling for data deep-dives. It solves our business needs in a changing environment.\u00a0In the aggregate, all these benefits highlight the significant cost savings, improved efficiency, streamlined processes, enhanced collaboration, and increased flexibility provided by the implementation of Board across the organization. The implemented Board platform includes solutions for KPI monitoring, financial planning, management communication, risk reporting and project planning & reporting.\u00a0What\u2019s next for \u00c5 Energi and Board?\u00a0Plans are in motion to rework and improve the overall user interface, improve operational planning, expand the number of Board users, and gain data from all subsidiaries. \u00c5 Energi aims to simplify and standardize its processes, continuously adapt to changing business models, and leverage Board to support longer-term strategic initiatives. The company recognizes the value of the Intelligent Planning Platform and its flexibility to discover solutions through self-service capabilities and financial consolidation and planning.\u00a0Based on its experience, \u00c5 Energi would highly recommend Board to other organizations. Hildebrandt notes: \u00a0Any company seeking an EPM solution that supports more than just basic financial planning and reporting should look to Board. It provides an Intelligent Planning approach, which we perceive as the ability to leverage data-driven insights to make informed decisions. Board's features, such as drill-down analysis, on-demand reporting, and efficient data visualization, empower \u00c5 Energi to analyze data effectively and drive continuous improvement in planning processes. Its self-service functionalities make it an ideal choice for organizations seeking a comprehensive solution.\u00a0Hildebrandt concludes on this point:\u00a0What we like most about Board is that it\u2019s a platform where we can do analysis and have integrated workflows. Board has helped us by providing transparent data, being able to analyze issues in real time that come from our data, and being able to directly communicate through Board itself. This has helped us immensely to keep our management up to date.\u00a0"

        "title": "Unified S&OP, Cost Planning, and Sales Analysis at Syngenta",
        "company": "Syngenta Italy",
        "content": "With annual sales of more than $13 billion, Syngenta \u2013 a Swiss multinational company formed in 2000 by a merger between Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals \u2013 is the world's leading specialist agribusiness group. With sales in excess of \u20ac200 million, Syngenta Italia employs around 400 people across offices, production sites, and test centers. In addition to handling agricultural chemicals and seed sales, the Group conducts research and produces maize and sugar beet seeds, partly for export. Milan is also home to the executive headquarters of the South East Europe Development Centre, one of the five research and development centers within the EMEA region.A deep-rooted relationshipThe history of Board at Syngenta goes beyond its formation in 2000. At that time, the Board Intelligent Planning Platform was already being used internally at Sandoz (subsequently acquired by Novartis) in the Agrichemicals and Plant Protection division for Sales and Expenses reporting, Consolidation Reporting, and planning support. The very first installation dates back to Version 2.0 of Board in 1994.Planning, Costing & Sales Analysis: an integrated approachThanks to its flexibility and its ability to integrate evolved analysis and planning capabilities, the use of Board has gradually been extended in the company and it is now the tool of choice at a country level for Cost Planning and Sales & Operations Planning.Of these two implementations, the latter is the company's pivotal process. This is the system that allows periodic revision of sales forecasts for the sales and marketing functions.A key step for the extension of Board in the company occurred in 2011 when Syngenta decided to integrate the Crop and Seeds sales teams worldwide. In the words of Ezio de Nittis, IS Business Partner for Syngenta Crop Protection and Syngenta Seeds Italia:\"This organisational decision called for rapid and precise action and a major commitment in terms of data homogeneity and management, just two months from the start of our peak sales period.\"This led to the need for a reporting system able to acquire data from SAP (used in Seeds) and submit integrated sales statistics for the Corn, DCF, and Vegetables areas. At that point, in view of the flexibility and time-to-solution typically guaranteed by the tool, it was decided that Board would be used manage the entire planning and forecasting support process, integrating data originating from SAP with data collected from the field.Cost and Planning (Expenses)\"This is an operating costs budgeting process, serving more than 30 users, in which the capabilities of Board are used intensively in terms of security management and in terms of the potential for multidimensional data-entry management,\"\u00a0explains Maridia Banfi, Business Process Analyst at Syngenta Italia.\"Each functional manager sees the expenses of their own cost center, while transverse cost managers (such as Human Resources for payroll and salaries), can consult expenses on all cost centres. Budget data is entered by the cost centre managers and the transverse expenses managers, depending on the security levels and in compliance with a grid type organisation. It's effectively a collaborative process, whereby an annual budget is defined, shared among various functions, and subjected to quarterly reviews.\"Customer financial position scorecard\"One of the many applications developed is dedicated to the finance team, which uses Board for a customer solvency assessment scorecard based on the calculation of shared indices such as DSO or DPO,\" Maridia continues. \"Finance and Credit personnel collect customers\u2019 economic data using a set of procedures, with the aim of assigning a score to each customer to provide an indication of their financial soundness. The data collected is fed to the sales data system and the payment systems.\"Sales and Operation Planning (SOP)The Board application \u2013 called SOP internally \u2013 reads and processes sales data for statistical analysis purposes. The Sales dashboard is presented in Board's desktop client for on-site users and using the web interface for external users (agents). Each agent has a specific security profile that limits their data entry and visibility privileges to the customers, areas, and products for which they are responsible.The planning process is divided into two separate phases in which the data is collected at different levels of aggregation:For the current year, sales force forecasts are collected with a high level of detail. The collected data relates to product quantity required in a specific geographical sales area, and is used to optimize the Supply Chain in terms of product stock and in relation to profitability optimization when it is not possible to cover all market demands fully.For\u00a0the next year, up to the 27th month, Marketing personnel work on the basis of forecasts at a higher level, taking account exclusively of the product and the sales area, without additional detailed information.Data updates are performed on the third working day of the month. At this point, responsibility for making any necessary upward or downward changes to the values lies with various company functions \u2013 such as Crop Managers, Area Managers, and Marketing Managers \u2013 in accordance with the required parameters including product by product and month by month. After this, meetings are held with Finance, Sales, and Supply Chain to decide whether or not to accept the changes. The final step is to draft the new validated plan incorporating the updates. This plan will be forwarded to the Supply Chain for any necessary production updates and to Logistics to check products currently in stock, or even for direct shipment of the product in question, if available. Maridia explains:\"The entire process takes place under the supervision of the Finance function because it is often the case that, with a supply chain featuring very long and generally fixed technical times, a series of complex decisions must be made concerning distribution of the material available in the short term in order to optimize the global profitability of the company.\"One innovation introduced last year involves the monitoring of forecasts using a Forecast Accuracy process in which, with a three-month horizon, forecasts for the preceding three months are analyzed with respect to sales to assess the degree of correlation with the actual situation.\"In this process,\" continues Maridia, \"Board supports the entire company cycle, from production to sales and delivery, providing management with constant access not just to the necessary data, but also to precise information on the data and its correlation with decisions made beforehand. The difference is evident in all meetings, where it now becomes possible to draw conclusions on the spot and share and document the decisions made in relation to future actions. Rather than just an application that supplies data, the tool provides valid support for collaborative decision-making processes.\"Future projectsEzio outlines the situation moving forward:\"Today, we've received authorization to proceed with local support of Forecasting and Planning projects for the Seeds division. The aim is to adopt the same Solution Operation Planning (SOP) approach currently used by the Crop Protection area in the coming months.\u201dThe Benefits: Increased efficiency, greater collaboration, and user self-sufficiency\"The benefits that led us to prefer Board over alternative tools can be summarized by the statement 'Board is appreciated globally'\", explains Ezio. \"Among the pluses, we emphasise the following points in particular.\"Speed of development and independence of the client\"The flexibility of the tool, accompanied by the support model, giving us the facility to build precisely what's needed rapidly. Syngenta can operate in complete independence for the development and management of the Board application.\"Usability of data\"The facility not only to view data, but also to edit it easily. This is the plus that distinguishes Board in absolute terms, and it's a feature that the application can actually deliver, unlike in the case of alternative tools, for which it remains purely theoretical.\"Clarity and consistency of data\"With Board, operations are performed on a single database containing sales data and the SOP process, all consolidated with a single reconciliation rather than via multiple cubes. This means that each process reads the same data and analysis is performed on the same database rather than on different cubes, thus guaranteeing unambiguity and normalization of information across the entire organization,\" says Maridia.Collaboration\"Ability to identify with and understand the users\u2019 needs. In meetings, for example, for practical reasons it's important for each participant to view the data from their own perspective, immediately, by means of direct interaction, ideally performed in the same dashboard. This means Board supports collaboration between co-workers, discussions become easier, and data is more readily comprehensible. Without this ability to navigate and interact with data instantly, this characteristic would be lost and discussions would become more complicated and potentially misleading.\u201dEase of useEzio concludes by discussing the benefits derived from the simplicity of using the Board platform:\"Another key and unchangeable aspect that demonstrates the tool's ease of use is the self-sufficiency available to advanced users, who can generate the analytics and reports they need without assistance.\u00a0This aspect brings three advantages: reduction of the IT workload as users don't need technical support to obtain the required results; self-sufficiency as users can manage reports independently, for example, if they decide that a different report type is needed to make a meeting more productive, they can create it directly and make it available to the other users; and time savings - execution is instant. When users need a report, they can generate it on-the-fly.\""

These versatile machines have found their way into many industries including food factories, plastics production, metalworking, foundries, electronics, medical technology, and entertainment.KUKA achieved sales revenues of around \u20ac3.2 billion in 2019 and employs over 14,000 people.The Challenge: Creating a company-wide, rolling planning process to aid growthStaying on a growth trajectory requires innovative product developments but also a sound planning process, and this is where KUKA saw the potential to optimize. Axel Flechtenmacher, Global Director for Planning & Logistics at KUKA (at that time), explains:\"We want to control our growth and that requires very precise expansion management, based on continuous and thorough planning that covers all the necessary departments and subsidiaries. With this in mind, our goal was to establish a company-wide, continuous, monthly planning process on a rolling basis.\"KUKA also wanted to restructure its planning organization by decentralizing future planning into the counter-flow process and introducing workflows and approval hierarchies.Prior to the project, KUKA's various departments conducted their planning activities separately using spreadsheets.\"Each department would submit an Excel spreadsheet with its own data, then Planning would spend hours patching it all together without any legitimate, consolidated database,\" says Axel.Sebastian Brand, Head of Sales and Service Controlling at KUKA, discusses the company's requirements for an alternative, more controlled solution:\"With the aim of having an integrated Sales & Operations Planning process we wanted to introduce a system that visualized the entire process \u2013 from strategic planning to finance and sales to production planning. The aim was to provide a structured, common database for Controlling, Sales, and Supply along with the relevant input and reporting functions to cover each department's planning and analysis requirements.\"The KUKA Controlling department was to use the new solution to create its annual year-end forecasts, a rolling monthly quarterly forecast, and to introduce a three-year budget.\"We wanted local management to be able to corroborate the entries within their own companies \u2013 to depict, for example, how incoming orders and revenue expectations developed compared with previous years, or how prices changed by product range and industry,\" explains\u00a0Sebastian.The Sales and Supply Chain Management teams were to use the S&OP system to generate a demand and master plan for the next 12-18 months, based on their sales planning.\u00a0Christina Stark, Global Demand Manager at KUKA, explains the challenges the company was facing with its existing systems:\"We used the SAP ERP planning solution before now, but it just wasn\u2019t modern enough for us and was more of a hindrance than a help. The entry and reporting options were too time-consuming and complicated. One of the things we wanted to do was to check the plausibility of Sales and Demand Planning with regard to key customers, scheduled product mix, and more.\"The company also wanted to integrate production resources and past figures into its planning process.The Solution: A unified approach to planning and analysis\"Looking for the right tools and partners we pretty much evaluated every standardized planning solution on the market. We quickly realized that our standard planning requirements were too specific because we placed such a great emphasis on analytic functions. It eventually became clear that our requirements could only really be met by a business intelligence tool that includes planning features,\"\u00a0says Axel.This realization led the business to the Board Intelligent Planning Platform, from vendor Board International, which offers smarter planning, actionable insights, and better outcomes. Axel stresses that KUKA's choice of solution was more than just a question of functionality:\"The partner supporting us was also important. That's where Board really won us over - they quickly developed a solution for the cases in our brief. \u00a0Within a very short time, Board developed what we found to be the best solution and presented it very professionally. They also demonstrated that they absolutely wanted to do this project for us.\"The Benefits: Increased standardization, control, accuracy, and collaborationAxel explains that once the project began, Board had ample opportunity to demonstrate not only their willingness but also their ability, in relation to a short deadline for the initial project requirements:\"The project started in June 2012. By the fall we wanted to be able to use the new tool to activate our budget planning \u2013 surely the most challenging planning for any business.\"The budget planning went live as scheduled, to the tangible benefit of the Controlling team, as Sebastian confirms:\"Before, we were all sending different versions of Excel spreadsheets around the world \u2013 the problem being that these versions were no longer up-to-date and difficult to merge. Now the figures are just there \u2013 all in one system, all in one format. For the first time ever we have a proper workflow.\"Together with the planning data input screen, KUKA's sales companies are now provided with predefined reports which they can use to check the plausibility of their data entries instantly and easily match the planning figures against the stored historical data. This gives the Controlling team the ability to track the planning status at every approval stage and to check which stage the planning is currently at. Controlling can also view and analyze scheduled planning objects as soon as they are entered into the system.The demand and master plan was implemented in a further step. Sales planning can be applied after the demand planning figures are verified. At this stage, the data is planned in more detail, allocated to a production plant, and matched against the available production resources. This results in a 'master plan' upon which material procurement and resource planning are based.Downstream, an integrated financial plan and human resources plan are generated as part of subprojects.\"We now have a standardized and resource-saving planning process which is in line with the corporate strategy.\u00a0 With the globally standard Board-based workflow, we can check the status of the planning results at any time and identify where we are in the planning stage. The planning quality, accuracy, and transparency have significantly increased, while the amount of work has reduced \u2013 especially for Controlling. Corrections can be done in the system itself and are automatically applied. Even updates to the various reports are automated. Not least due to the challenges stirred up by the latest developments in the automotive industry, this flexibility is priceless,\" explains Axel.\"Sales Managers in the sales units now have the chance to lead their employees through effective processes and tools. We can also visualize our sales planning in much more detail,\" adds Sebastian.With Board, KUKA also benefits from a standard, company-wide database which avoids the various departments sending multiple queries to the subsidiaries. There is also another positive side-effect: the way the various departments cooperated in putting together the planning screens fostered an organic and intensive mutual exchange of ideas and close collaboration.\"This is a huge step forward for us,\" stresses Axel. \"In the past, planning was an activity that was separate in every way. It has since blossomed into true teamwork.\"KUKA continues to optimize its reporting system and Board usage in everyday operations. The planning tool is now used in all 30 sales companies of KUKA Robotics in Germany, Europe, and Asia as well as North and South America."

        "content": "Headquartered in The Hague, Odido is a mobile and fixed-line telecommunications provider, and the Netherlands\u2019 market leader in mobile communications with 6.8 million mobile customers. The company sees an annual revenue of \u20ac2 billion.The Challenge: Siloed data and hidden insightsLike many organizations, Odido\u2019s financial planning and reporting processes have traditionally revolved around Excel spreadsheets, which involve immense manual effort and have made it hard to gain the required insights as the company has grown. As Gerben Bijlholt, Senior Business Controller at Odido explains:\u201cWe knew we needed to do something about our reporting. Excel is a very powerful tool, but at a point it will work against you more than it helps you. We had too much data in too many different formats to gain a clear picture of our operations.\u201dFaced with multiple versions of the truth, labor-intensive close processes, and an inability to make the most of its data, Odido sought a unified and centralized financial planning, budgeting, and reporting system. One that would support its plans for continued growth. The company\u2019s goals were to unite financial and non-financial data to get clear visibility into profit and loss drivers, reduce time-to-insight, and create an all-important single version of the truth that would facilitate on-demand insights across the organization. \u00a0The Solution: A single, centralized platform for driver-based analysisAfter a thorough software selection process, Odido chose the Board Intelligent Planning Platform to replace its existing SAP BW solution. Its criteria was a platform that would unify its data streams and provide access to accurate, timely information for financial reporting, while allowing decision makers to drill into the details as needed. It also wanted to manage forecasts, create budgets, and identify how key drivers were affecting results all from a single location. For a complicated organization with an intense IT landscape, Board\u2019s ability to provide all of these capabilities in one place proved a significant selling point.Odido first focused on integrating its profit and loss statements and non-financial data within Board. It now has plans to build on these early first steps, adding more data streams with the aim of gaining deeper and more granular insights.One of the major benefits of Board is that it\u2019s a solution Odido can manage in-house, without the need for any intense programming. This made it easy for the company to access the capabilities it needed quickly, and spin up new, customized solutions as and when they\u2019re required \u2013 like more advanced forecasting processes, which will be implemented later.\u201cOne of the reasons we chose Board is that we actually wanted to maintain the solution ourselves. Working together with Board and our implementation partner Finext, it\u2019s been easy to arrive at what we want \u2013 and we\u2019re always moving towards doing more,\u201d says Gerben. \u00a0Key Takeaways: Important lessons from a successful deploymentTwo years after the implementation, the Board platform is proving a success at Odido, and the company expects to take further advantage of its capabilities moving forwards.Implementations like this aren\u2019t always easy, but with the help of Board and Odido\u2019s implementation partner Finext, Gerben has learnt four valuable lessons based on the success of this migration:Start small think big: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that you have a good overview of what you want to achieve, but you shouldn\u2019t get lost in the details. It\u2019s easy to get lost in your ambitions and want everything at once. You have to start with getting the basics right, so our focus was to get rid of our old reporting system and progress from there.\u201dSell the tool: \"If you want people to embrace new things, you have to bring them along with you. You have to communicate where you want to go and what the benefits are to your people and to the company. It\u2019s also important to ask what people need from the new solution and try to deliver it.\u201dPeople, people, people: \u201cAt the start of the project we talked to quite a big group of people and found a lot of opinions. We then scaled down to a smaller group and focused on the people that were really enthusiastic about the project, and that helped us to build the system that we have today.\u201dDon\u2019t lose yourself in history or hearsay: \u201cIn a big company you often find that people have done things in a certain way for a long time. People can be resistant to change, as they\u2019ve seen it before and sometime seen it fail. It\u2019s important not to get caught up in this. You should focus on trying to prove that things are possible, and that there is another way of working.The Benefits: A single source of truth, timely insights, and increased data availabilityBoard now provides Odido with a vital single source of business-critical information. Data flows directly from SAP into a master dataset within the platform, so the company can map its various segments and its profit and loss into one structure. As a result, for the first time in a long time, everyone within the company is now looking at the same information.As well as this single source of truth, the Board platform has allowed Odido to reduce the manual effort involved in gathering data and populating spreadsheets. Automatic ingestion means that data is always available and, importantly, always up to date. With the hours saved, Odido\u2019s teams can dedicate more time analyzing data and making strategic decisions, as opposed to trying to collate and make sense of disparate spreadsheets and reports.With Board, Odido has also been able to gain vital insights into key profit and loss drivers, by combining financial and non-financial data in one place. This non-financial data currently includes information around customer base numbers and customer churn, and the company plans to add more data as its use of the platform continues.With these two data streams working side by side, it\u2019s easy to see patterns and correlations that would otherwise be hidden, and identify causes for peaks and troughs in revenue. \u00a0\u201cBefore, we weren\u2019t able to use all the data we had at our disposal, and that limited us in terms of serving our business needs. If we wanted insights into why revenue or cost is acting one way or the other it would take a lot of time to dive into that,\u201d says Gerben.This extra insight proved particularly useful during the COVID-19 pandemic, when customer behaviors changed almost overnight.\u201cWe were faced with the fact that people weren\u2019t shopping anymore. Revenues and costs related to roaming were impacted, too. But having that non-financial data made it easy to compare revenue to usage and explain those changes,\u201d Gerben continues.In a turbulent Telco market, having insight into how non-financial data affects profit and loss is a transformative capability. Using Board, Odido can now easily drill down into information and see what\u2019s happening in the general ledger, comparing scenarios, periods, and segments at will.Board has also given Odido the ability to forecast both more accurately and more iteratively, comparing forecasts based on different uploads and presenting all the information in one place so people have clear visibility into what\u2019s happening.\u201cWe\u2019re now looking at working on more advanced forecasting initiatives. With Board, we can look at things like how roaming KPIs or base numbers are developing, and examine a two or three-year period to get a clear view of where we\u2019re heading,\u201d says Gerben.Ultimately, Gerben believes the Board platform has fundamentally changed the role of finance within the company, allowing it to use historical data, accurate budgets, and forecasts to explain thinking, challenge assumptions, and embrace a more strategic role in operations:\u201cThanks to Board, our financial team has evolved from a number cruncher into a real business partner, able to drive performance in a turbulent environment. We have a good overview of everything that\u2019s happening in the company, so it widens the scope of what we can do and the kinds of conversations and inputs we can have\u2026I\u2019m now moving to another role in the company, and I\u2019ll be sure to take Board with me.\u201d"

        "title": "Commercial Budgeting, Management Control, and Segment Reporting at Banco BPM",
        "company": "Banco BPM",
        "content": "Following the merger between Banco Popolare and Banca Popolare di Milano, Banco BPM Group now serves 4 million customers through a wide-reaching distribution network within a multi-channel model. Thanks to its territorial coverage, with a strategic position in Northern Italy, the group is a national leader in several high value-added business sectors. It has a portfolio of renowned brands and product cross-selling opportunities. Creating sustainable value for shareholders and target areas through stable profitability and development is an integral part of Banco BPM's mission.Banco BPM's structure (partly due to mergers and acquisitions) has become increasingly complex over the years, making a systemic approach to budgeting essential. Although the parent company mainly manages the sales network, a holistic approach is needed to create the budget and assign sales targets. An assessment is also required to review the impact on the group's companies and partnerships and their respective distribution agreements. All these elements need to be weighed up to direct the planning process with a group-wide focus. Cristiano Perillo Marcone, Head of Commercial Management Control at Banco BPM, explains:\"This systemic approach to the budgeting process \u2013 increasingly put into practice since Board was introduced to the organization - allows us to find the best way to allocate the budget to the group's business lines and support external partnerships. We can now efficiently determine which business shares to assign to our partners in the insurance, asset management, managed assets, consumer credit, and non-banking sectors.\"Overview of the Board project at Banco BPM\u00a0In 2012, all banks in the Banco Popolare Group were merged under the parent company. Previously, the parent company would set a series of general budgeting guidelines, which were then applied by the Network Banks' Management Control structures. Under the new model, the budget structure had to be devoted entirely by the parent company with a unified approach.The first requirement was integration.\"We started by trying to cover all our planning and analysis needs with Excel spreadsheets. However, given the number of analytical metrics to be projected (around 20,000 at the time), and after multiplying the metrics to be measured by the number of key dimensions of the business, this proved to be inadequate\".The Excel budgeting model required manual data entry and processing, which created high operational risks, potential misalignments between users, and an overly simplistic reporting structure, with limited in-depth analysis and trend representation opportunities.A dizzying \"dimensional\" leap forward to keep pace with the group's growthBanco BPM decided to introduce a new planning and analysis solution, opting for the Board Intelligent Planning Platform. Having secured the quality and completeness of its data by migrating it from spreadsheets to the Board database, Banco\u00a0BPM has exponentially increased the amount of projected analytical figures from 20,000 to as many as 47 million. This has occurred over eight years, mainly due to further mergers and acquisitions.\u00a0\"Without Board's high-performing platform, in terms of technology and business logic, it would have been impossible to manage and analyze so many metrics effectively,\" explains Cristiano Perillo Marcone. \"Board allows us to determine the budget targets to be assigned to the various group entities and explain why those specific objectives were set.\"To this end, the financial cost allocation process has been digitalized with an ABC approach where the controller directly costs the BPM Group's organizational units and assigns them the services they use to establish their correct share of costs.Banco BPM's budgeting process has been standardized and integrated with a multidimensional approach.\u00a0This improvement has significantly reduced operational risk factors and aligned metrics with official reporting.Furthermore, Banco BPM has transformed an approach primarily geared to using historical data to replicate business plans into a forward-looking process that considers current trends as well as medium to long-term market forecasts. Perillo Marcone notes a key turning point for the banking and financial services sector, which \u2013 with the help of the Board team \u2013 Banco BPM was able to navigate very smoothly.\"In 2013, the data history showed that interest rates were rising, so customers should have continued to come to us for more profitable bond deposits. However, with our improved ability to analyze key metrics and business dimensions from that year onwards, we found that the rate projection indicated a downward trend. Therefore, as interest rates fell, we were able to predict that customers would have stopped returning less expensive deposit instruments and moved over to ones that were more expensive for the bank and more profitable for the customer. Instead, we predicted the opposite (which came true in 2014-2015): an asset rotation with customers who, as interest rates declined, asked to repay their existing loan to take out a new one that was less expensive. \u00a0Board, therefore, allowed us to set up a different business scenario rather than simply replicating what we had done in the past.\"Board's functions have also allowed BPM to make significant improvements to its corporate reporting. In particular, segment reporting is introduced to structure and engineer the monthly reporting process for the group's profit allocation. It was broken down by business line, structuring the appropriate institutional (IFRS8-compliant segment reporting) and management reporting.\"The main aim of segment reporting is to show the profitability of the various business areas,\"\u00a0explains Perillo Marcone.\u00a0Board's logical architecture, which combines planning, reporting, and analytics, has allowed us to build a structured data processing system that includes planning and accounting features\u00a0in a user-friendly analysis environment. This is well-structured but flexible enough to respond to regulatory and organizational changes in reporting requirements quickly.\"In addition to the commercial budget processing, analysis, and segment reporting projects, Banco BPM has also rolled out an application for advisory services. This uses the Board platform's simulation feature to create and manage various business scenarios to respond to supervisory bodies' requests specifically. The BPM Group needed to develop investment and divestment planning through a multi-scenario simulation model using the same parameters as those applied when assessing the adequacy of transactions. As Perillo Marcone explains:\"Consob requires us to integrate budgeting activities with detailed analyses for each client portfolio so that we can ensure consistency with the assessments of individual clients when setting the sales network's budget targets for investment services. Once again, it was vital to make the right decision by creating plans that align with the group's management decisions and demonstrate \u2013both internally and to supervisory bodies \u2013 that solid figures back up the budget. Here too, the Board platform has proved indispensable, as we have found ourselves having to manage a vast number of key metrics and dimensions. These have grown from an initial 20,000 figures to 2 million, right up to the 47 million elementary objectives we manage today.\"Given Board's great benefits for the budgeting process, as part of advisory and segment reporting, Banco BPM's management decided to extend its use to the Institutional Department, an area with more \"concentrated\" counter parties, managed directly by the parent company. This area operates with banking logic that cannot be determined on an aggregate basis, as with the sales network projections. Therefore, the Institutional Department has a budgeting process that, despite ultimately being considered at the group level, is very different and separate from the rest of the planning cycle. The Institutional Department deals with huge clients. Planning, therefore, requires close attention and analytical skills, so much so that the budget for this division of Banco BPM is managed on an individual customer basis (for significant customers, at least). As the Institutional Department's target includes a few large customers, Banco BPM used to manage the budgeting directly using Excel spreadsheets. However, to make the most of the analysis, automation, and risk minimization benefits of Board seen in other areas of the group, Banco BPM built an app on Board. This structures and streamlines the Institutional Department's Excel sheets and the entire budgeting process, making them part of the \"virtuous planning cycle\" in the Board environment:\"We only used Excel for the initial stages of budgeting for large individual clients, but with Board, we can gather the Institutional Department objectives set on the spreadsheet and integrate them with the overall objectives of the sales network,\"\u00a0explains Perillo Marcone.From two weeks to two days: Board's fast-budget effectBanco BPM's management has found Board to be a highly efficient tool, even for internal tasks, presentations, and discussions, where the main person involved, is a CEO or GM. Senior managers and executives were increasingly required to quickly process changes or guidelines required by the CEO or GM to analyze important or noteworthy simulations. Banco BPM, therefore, introduced an app called \"Fast Budget.\" \u00a0 Perillo Marcone recalls:\"When we examined budgeting or forecasting scenarios that don't assign objectives to the sales network, we had to meet with a CEO or GM for them to tell us what action to take or what changes to make. Then we needed to meet again a couple of days later for the updated projections.\u00a0Before using Board, when we only had Excel spreadsheets, this would take us an average of two weeks! \u00a0With Board's 'Fast Budget,' we can quickly and easily create an aggregate or summarized list to sum up the budget. This can then be presented in an effective and immediately accessible way for senior figures such as General Managers or CEOs, without showing all of the details relevant to Sales Managers. \u00a0Now, with Board's 'Fast Budget,' it only takes two days to report figures to the CEO! Including the budget result and all key metrics to be analyzed with a suitable explanatory set of data.As the group has grown, especially after the merger of Banco BPM with Banca Popolare di Milano, management has introduced a segmentation logic to make the various budgeting process cycles more effective. The various group entities differentiate these without losing sight of the overall picture.\"We've implemented a planning process that is consistent with the various business owners we deal with,\" Perillo Marcone adds.\u00a0\"When we talk to the head of the retail segment, for example, we discuss the retail budget. If this retail network is partly distributed over Banco BPM and partly over Banca Popolare di Milano, Board allows us to make assessments across a unified retail segment. The same applies to the corporate part and so on. Board has also made it much easier to process the various segments: the segments of the business budget network can match up with those opened in the segment reporting. One of the many benefits of this alignment is that it has improved our relations with supervisory bodies.\"Board has also been used for general operational performance management at individual branch level based on an analytical model for monitoring the operational efficiency of local structures, which has ensured correct sizing of the distribution network.A commercial budget allocated to 26,400 business unitsAs seen, the planning of the retail, corporate, private, and institutional segments has integrated with the reporting and application of fast budgets. Going even further, Banco BPM has used Board to create a Commercial Budget projection process that assigns targets to each business area, branch, and manager, involving thousands of Business Units:\"Carrying out a budget projection process of this magnitude has exponentially increased the number of figures to be analyzed\u00a0\u2013 (generated by multiplying the relevant metrics by the key business dimensions). We're talking about 47 million projections to date in around 26,400 business units. Without Board, this would have been simply unmanageable,\"\u00a0Perillo Marcone adds.Given the now vast number of projections and business units involved in Banco BPM's commercial budgeting processes, the group has also decided to turn to Board for asset quality.The next project will involve making projections of any potential deterioration in the loan portfolio, determining its impact on risk metrics, and integrating them with the Commercial Budgeting economic and capital projections. Thanks to the Board platform's integration features, these dynamics will be developed and combined with the sales network budget projections. \"Again,\" Perillo Marcone concludes, \"We expect to have easier relations with supervisory bodies, the sales network, and the credit sector. This is because\u00a0Board arms us with the figures we need to demonstrate the overall consistency of the targets we assign to the sales network.\""

The company serves the needs of healthcare providers and educators with products and services for Basic and Advanced Life Support, Simulation, Airway Management, Immobilization, Patient Care, Self-directed Learning, and Medical Education.Laerdal has dedicated the last 60 years to vital medical research and has big ambitions to make a huge impact on society, with the goal of saving 500,000 more lives every year.The Laerdal group is focused on three business areas:\u00a0patient care, resuscitation, and a non-profit organization\u00a0called Laerdal Global Health which takes care of people living in low resource income countries.Board Project OverviewBoard Financial Consolidation 4.0\u200b19 currencies16 nodes96 reporting units285 cost centers229 product groupsManagerial reportingProject budgeting & reportingSales, Marketing & Services forecastingThe journey from financial consolidation to operational budgeting and forecastingLaerdal\u2019s existing financial reporting system was too cumbersome and rigid to keep pace with the growth of the organization. Identifying this problem, the management team decided the legacy software should be replaced with a modern IT platform that would support the business in achieving its ambitious goals.Laerdal was looking for a transformative solution capable of unifying different processes in a single environment \u2013 from analytics to planning, reporting, and forecasting. This had to be achieved across 33 legal entities, 96 business units, 16 branches with no ERP system (only CSV-based solutions), and a plethora of data sources including Oracle Sibel, Salesforce, Cornerstone, and Dell Boomi applications.Robin Wittmeyer, Project Manager at Laerdal, explains the selection process:There was lots of extra stuff we needed to do so we did one vendor round focused around two key criteria.\u00a0The solution had to be a best-in-class product and it had to be a cloud platform, which is why we selected Board.The unification of processes at Laerdal was broken down into four key project areas:Financial consolidation, covering the entire financial-close cycle, to deliver the final financial statements to board members and relevant authorities;Managerial reporting to keep control of KPIs and deliver financial reports to stakeholders, managers, and decision-makersFinancial planning and analysis to provide project managers with financial budgets and details of their performanceSales, Marketing and Service forecasting to allow process stakeholders to generate and share their forecasts and provide useful information for Laerdal\u2019s supply chainTransforming financial and non-financial processes according to the real needs of the decision-makersRobin continues by explaining how, with Board, Laerdal has been able to integrate processes and data across the organization to create a single point of truth:\u00a0Now we're in much better shape. We have the financial figures to support our business. We have the KPIs presented to management. The project managers can use the system to drill down and see where costs are coming from. They can go so far that they can actually pick up the invoice itself and bring it up. So, it's a huge improvement. But we would have never changed our master data unless we had seen the transparency that Board gave us to start with.As\u00a0Lars Christiansen, Finance Systems Implementation Manager at Laerdal, highlights, all financial data coming from the different databases is reconciled in the Board Financial Consolidation environment:What\u2019s important to see here is that\u00a0we have the reconciliation database. And that means that all the data is reconciled here, so that\u00a0we are absolutely sure that the consolidated financial statement reporting, statutory reporting, and managerial reporting are aligned. We have a decentralized loading process, meaning that all the users load data themselves and they follow our process and validate data themselves.\u00a0Therefore, at the end,\u00a0when we validate every month, we validate 33 legal entities in Board.The financial consolidation process is fully automated with Board Financial Consolidation, as Lars continues:We automatically consolidate 96 reporting units, 16 nodes, 19 currencies, 285 cost centers, and 229 product groups. In the managerial reporting, this workflow is automatically executed every night.In Laerdal, as in any other company, the financial dimension is not separated from the operational one. Thanks to Board Intelligent Planning Platform's capabilities, Laerdal can generate internal reports to better understand the performance and financial impact of manufacturing, supply chain, and the external sales activities, as Lars continues:Every day when we come to work, we enter Board and we have the latest data from yesterday, already within this workflow.In budgeting and reporting processes, users follow the different steps that they need to execute and end up with a budget summary. Similarly,\u00a0with the sales, marketing, and services forecast figures, people follow a process-driven approach which ends up in a forecast summary. Lars concludes:We have simultaneous data entry from 33 countries, scenario simulation, multicurrency data entry, auditability, and a validation workflow.\u00a0Board makes it possible to create a unique data layer where information is translated in each business unit according to the real needs of the decision-makers."

Complex, Excel-based budgets and forecasts were difficult to maintain and lacked the flexibility required to adapt to changing market environments.\u00a0The desired state was to have a unified approach to producing budgets and forecasts across for all 40 companies within the group, so that data could easily be fed back to the parent company in Japan for consolidation.\u00a0The Solution: A single platform for all budgeting, forecasting, and reporting activitiesAfter an extensive Proof of Concept (PoC), that lasted for a week and involved numerous stakeholders from the finance and sales teams, TME selected the Board Intelligent Planning Platform, which offers smarter planning, actionable insights and better outcomes in one, user-friendly environment. During the PoC, Board was tested against numerous key elements of TME\u2019s use case, which included standardization of P&L production, variance analysis, and other budgeting & forecasting activities. One of the key reasons for the selection of Board was its ability to allow end-users to easily perform data entry, which was crucial to the efficient running of the process.\u00a0Board sits on top of TME\u2019s ERP and a data warehouse, pulling actual P&L data from 40 companies in near real-time, all while users are connected and undertaking planning activities, as Jordan Rowley, Project Manager at TME, explains:\u201cOur data warehouse picks the data up from the ERP on a live basis, so as soon as a posting is made it is picked up automatically. We make use of the concurrency feature of Board to pull the data through on a near-live basis from our data warehouse. At the moment, we\u2019re reading the data warehouse every 30 minutes.\u201dWith the Board platform in place, TME embarked on a multi-phase project over a three-year period, with several key milestones affecting different areas of the organization, as Jordan continues:\u00a0\u201cWe decided very early on that we didn\u2019t want to just do one big implementation at the very end of the project. We broke it down, effectively based on an agile approach, where we took a portion of our development at a time and went live with that through the course of the three years. We wanted to gain benefit throughout and wanted to learn from Board along the way so we could make better, more-informed decisions about what we wanted to implement going forward. It also enabled us to gain extensive feedback from our customers \u2013 our end users. One of the key things in any implementation is listening to the customers and making sure we provide them with what they want.\u201dThe Board project timeline at Toyota, presented at the Board Day 2020 conference.As a customizable platform rather than a pre-defined solution, Board enabled TME to take this phased approach with ease, gradually delivering different elements of the overall solution to the various business units. The project began in 2017, as Jordan explains:\u201cOur first major milestone was the implementation of the budget and forecasting planning process for 21 of the companies. This included both planning and reporting elements and was really an important milestone for us. Following this, we implemented local P&L reporting and an allocation process in Board, ready for year end. The existing process was in Excel and was quite complex to maintain so we were keen on pulling that into Board as early as we could.\u201dThe project continued with the expansion of local P&L reporting to the group P&L, in addition to variance analysis with a multi-currency approach. TME then tweaked and enhanced the various aspects of the solution, taking user feedback into account throughout to drive continuous improvement.\u00a0\u201cIn addition to working well internally within the different teams and companies, we have worked very closely with Board. We\u2019ve learned\u00a0a lot from the Board team, and they\u2019ve learned\u00a0from us too. It\u2019s been a mutually beneficial relationship, and one that we\u2019re continuing with moving forward,\u201d comments Jordan.\u00a0The Benefits: Greater reporting and planning insight, reduced manual effort, and increased controlNow the system has 750 users, including group and local controllers as well as those outside the finance team. All of them input planning data and produce and review budgets and forecasts using one standardized approach in Board. These users are split equally between TME\u2019s head offices, manufacturing companies, and marketing & sales companies. Jordan explains:\u201cWe have many systems and many entities, so the standardized process we have implemented is an important solution for us. This standardization has enabled us to produce faster, more efficient planning and reporting cycles.\u201dMuch of the process is now automatic, freeing up members to focus on decision-making rather than data collation and comparison.\u201cWe now have a fully automated group reporting pack, which has enabled us to shift to analysis and away from data collection. Previously, we had many different Excel files and lots of data needed to be manually collected. Board has enabled us to remove all of that. We now have an automated collection process which means our Controllers can spend the majority of their time analyzing the data and reacting to situations, making better-informed business decisions,\u201d continues Jordan.\u00a0In-depth reporting and variance analysisYear-to-date group variance analysis and dynamic reporting can now be produced with ease in Board, using near real-time data. More than 40 KPIs such as mix impact and exchange rate impact make it easy to understand the numbers from 40 companies. Exchange rate simulation is also present, providing further insight throughout the process and the ability to simulate fluctuations in specific currencies.\u00a0\u201cThese features are used in collaboration with the P&L analysis, which is broken down into two component parts. We have what we call Profitability Analysis, which is looking at the profitability of the group overall in terms of vehicles and revenue streams. We also have more specific P&L reporting broken down to quite a low level of detail,\u201d says Jordan.Outside of P&Ls, Board provides much greater depth in reports, enabling users to examine the data from multiple perspectives, as Jordan explains:\u201cWith reporting in general, we have many options and flexibilities within the system. We can look from a group viewpoint, so predominantly in our group Euro currency, but we can also view the reports from a local company perspective, at a micro level with a local currency. As mentioned previously, we also have quite an extensive allocation process within the system, and importantly here, end user reporting too; reports that the non-finance users refer to on a daily basis. Budget vs. actual is quite an important KPI for them, as well as their planning data for forecasting. Throughout Board, we give the users the option of filtering and adding additional parameters in each of their screens or reports, so if they do want to drill down into a lower level of detail, they can.\u201dClear, transparent P&L generationTME is now able to quickly see company and group-level results by various dimensions. This creates transparency and understanding over the real contribution of each product to the bottom line.\u00a0A five-year view of CAPEXGap analysis, which can be conducted between two chosen scenarios to understand where eventual forecast or budget corrections should happen, is predominantly used for the manufacturing companies within the group. In addition, a robust CAPEX process was implemented for these businesses, as Jordan explains:\u201cThis was a process that includes a five-year plan. Obviously CAPEX spend is quite significant, so that is something that needs a lot of planning and so we needed a comprehensive process for CAPEX.\u201dInteractive planning and scenario modelingIn addition to reporting and analysis, Board facilitates the quick and agile collection of multiple scenarios and versions to help the business plan and react to various challenges effectively. Using Board, TME manages:Collection templates specific to different companies and processesA forecasting and zero-based budgeting process, which is driver-based for some casesPlanning simulation through versioningReal-time integration with the ERP system, including cross-validation rules for dataA four-step workflow to control the planning process\u201cThe key feature we wanted was templates that facilitated quick and agile collection of data,\u201d says Jordan. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want an extensive, elaborate template that would be a burden to users. We\u2019ve implemented collection templates specific to companies and process that are really easy for the users to see, which are based on their own feedback.\u201d\u00a0Inbuilt workflow in the Board platform, combined with an easy-to-understand traffic light indicator for progress, has also enabled greater control throughout the planning process.\u201cWhen a user submits a template it does go through a basic workflow. We can track the submissions of all of the templates, which is important when we are talking about many of them. We also have a driver-based approach on some of the templates where the data is collected on a unit cost basis, and then within the Controlling team that is visualized and multiplied up by the production volume to give the total usage for the factory.\u201dThe ability to create different versions of data in Board has increased the frequency of forecasting, which was especially useful during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201cWe have made extensive use of versioning in Board, which has been very important in recent times. We prepared an initial budget which, in ordinary circumstances, would have become the final budget. In the COVID-19 situation, Board enabled us to create multiple versions of that budget and multiple forecasts. Normally we would have only had quarterly forecasts,\u201d says Jordan.Scenario modeling can also be conducted with ease in Board, enabling users to make more-informed decisions based on the potential impact of different situations. There are currently 120 scenario versions in use, providing crucial financial insight:\u201cWe have the ability throughout Board to compare as many different scenarios as we want. So, we can compare budget against actual, this year\u2019s budget to last year, multiple versions of the budget, and so on,\u201d Jordan continues.Key Recommendations: Understand your requirements ensure your data quality is highHaving almost reached the end of the transformational project, Jordan has some key advice for those embarking on a similar journey:\u00a0\u201cThe key one for us was that we needed to fully understand and document the requirements before commencing the development. We needed to do some reworking at certain points in the process because we hadn\u2019t fully understood the requirements before we commenced and implemented.\u201d\u00a0Another lesson was learned through the implementation of a planning template that was initially too accounting focused:\u00a0\u201cWhat we tried to do was copy what we had in Excel and reflect that directly in Board. Very quickly we learned that we needed to apply the best practices of Board \u2013 they have experience working with many companies and many customers, and we\u2019ve benefited from that extensively.\"The final point is on data quality:\"I think this goes without saying, but it\u2019s something we learnt the hard way. Data quality is a key prerequisite to quality reporting. It\u2019s one thing defining and creating reports within Board, but unless our data quality is of a sufficient standard, and standard across all companies, the reporting that we get out of Board cannot meet the required standard. So that\u2019s something we\u2019ve worked hard on and would, in hindsight, have done upfront before the implementation,\u201d Jordan concludes."

        "content": "Formed in 1996, Mitsubishi Electric Ltd is the UK branch of Mitsubishi Electric Europe, one of the largest of the 22 core companies that form the Mitsubishi Corporation. The business has seven branches in the UK and six operational divisions: Living Environmental Systems (LES), also known as air conditioning systems; Factory Automation (FA); Visual Information Systems (VIS); Diamond Vision (DV); Lift & Escalator Division (LED); and Automotive.The Challenge: Resource-intensive, legacy reporting processesHaving used the same SAP-based ERP system since 1998, Mitsubishi Electric desperately needed an upgrade. Despite the addition of a user-friendly front end that allowed users to upload data, manage stock, produce quotations, and process orders, the system still fell short in several areas, resulting in inefficient manual processes that frustrated users.The existing system was inflexible, required manual data consolidation, and any changes to reporting had to be programmed manually. Given the rate of change within the business, this meant keeping up a continuous and expensive development program that swallowed up hours - or even weeks - of third-party development resources for every report. With\u00a0hundreds of reports to generate, Mitsubishi Electric turned to spreadsheets to manipulate ERP data into the required format, leading to accuracy and version control issues, and a reduction in the company\u2019s ability to respond quickly to emerging business needs.The accounts department was also experiencing a number of pain points that included manual reconciliation processes, which could take up to two weeks to complete, and complex budgeting processes that involved spreadsheets being sent back and forth to divisions before being entered into a third-party tool.As part of a drive to continuously evolve internal operations, and improve technologies and services throughout the business, Mitsubishi Electric decided to invest in a\u00a0single platform that would enable the company to integrate data from multiple legacy systems into a unified, service-rich environment.\u00a0The desire was to give users\u00a0real-time access\u00a0to accurate, multi-dimensional transactional data; enable quick and\u00a0self-sufficient reporting\u00a0through analytical capabilities including dashboards and KPI analyses; and the ability to conduct budgeting and forecasting.\u00a0To ease the burden on the IT department\u2019s month-end productivity, the new system would also need to adjust to new requirements and data while empowering users around the business to create their own reports, ABAP queries, and analyses.\u00a0The Solution: Intelligent PlanningAfter looking at several internal and external solutions - including SAP, Cognos, and Crystal Reports - Mitsubishi Electric chose the Board Intelligent Planning Platform for its ability to offer smarter planning, actionable insights and better outcomes, as well as its\u00a0speed, simplicity, and flexibility.\u00a0\"Board was able to show us a PoC using our own data within a matter of days,\" says John Quickenden, Manager - Business Support Group at Mitsubishi Electric.The Board platform unifies strategy, finance and operations to plan smarter and achieve full control of performance, delivering the full range of services Mitsubishi Electric needed across its order management, accounting, and reporting processes and speeding up the delivery of information to the business from days to minutes, or even seconds.\u00a0\"Choosing the integrated Board solution meant there was no need to purchase additional modules because Board delivers what we need in a single environment. This means we have a\u00a0future-proof platform to manage our planning needs,\" says John.Mitsubishi Electric worked with Board Business Partner SDG Consulting, who provided the implementation skills and industry knowledge needed to ensure the solution met the broad range of requirements.\u00a0Iain Blazey, General Manager IT Operations & Services at Mitsubishi Electric Europe, explains the implementation process:We took a phased approach, beginning with a sales reporting system to provide performance reports from SAP, followed by a quoting system, a logistics system, and ending with a full end-to-end integration project that provides details on how a quote is created all the way to after-sales tracking.These solutions include budgeting and forecasting capabilities that enable users to write back their forecasts directly into Board, as well as an Executive Dashboard which provides vital information across multiple parameters and allows the management team to analyze figures as needed without any intervention from the IT department. Information can also be filtered by a wide range of categories, giving users the ability to extract the information they need at a granular level.Using the Board platform, Mitsubishi Electric can\u00a0streamline sales & order analysis\u00a0so users can better understand how many quotes are issued for each project, average win/loss rates, the accuracy of sales forecasts over the next six months, customer purchase trends, sales cycles, and average discounts.\u00a0\u00a0Board also allows Mitsubishi Electric to record volumetric and weight information on materials so users can see information such as stock values by quantity, volume, value, and weight as well as the total volume of warehouse space currently being used. This can be filtered and customized in a number of ways, with Board putting the power in the end users\u2019 hands and taking the pressure away from other departments.\"The more I discover about the toolkit the more I realize I am on a learning curve. When we started delivering Board the specifications were a certain size and we found that as we implemented Board and people saw what it could do these grew and grew,\" explains John.The Benefits: Streamlined processes, increased accuracy, and greater flexibilityMitsubishi Electric\u2019s offices in Ireland, Spain, France, and Germany have all adopted Board and are experiencing the following benefits:Increased planning accuracy:\u00a0Sales teams now have visibility of the whole sales process, from quote to delivery and beyond, thanks to accurate sales pipeline reporting which incorporates daily feedback to Salesforce via automated emailed reports. This information empowers sales teams to identify trends and react to market needs more quicklyInstant sales analysis:\u00a0Sales and Order analysis used to be a 10-hour process but can now be run in just two secondsImproved autonomy:\u00a0Business units can now create and modify their own reports and aggregate data across all European branchesStreamlined reporting processes:\u00a0Rather than weeks, it now takes just 25 minutes to run a standard report and make it fully available to all divisional heads, who then have the flexibility to filter the information as required\u00a0Improved credit control:\u00a0Invoices are now fully digital and reconciled within an hour, flagging any mismatches or inconsistencies for further analysisEnhanced flexibility:\u00a0Users can now create forecasts at a granular rather than aggregate level, empowering greater flexibility and analysisRapid results:\u00a0Board began to show results back to the business in just three weeks and has since helped maintain control and profitability of a business unit that has grown rapidly to over \u20ac1bn sales across Europe\"This was one of the projects that got me noticed by the wider business, not only for implementing a technical solution based on the business need but for giving the business back the control and the ability to serve themselves and help drive their business forward,\" adds Iain.The Future: Bringing budgeting and forecasting into the platformBoard was originally intended as a tool for the UK business, but it has proved so successful that Mitsubishi Electric is now looking to expand its use to other regions as a way of empowering the business to deliver timely information to the Corporate HQ. The desire is to use Board to replace disparate branch-based budgeting and forecasting tools with a common solution. John concludes:The more people that use Board, the more they want from it and Board has provided us with the flexibility, capability, and speed to support this change across the business."

        "title": "Automated reporting across multiple care homes at BlueCross",
        "company": "BlueCross",
        "content": "BlueCross is a private aged care provider based in the State of Victoria, Australia, providing a range of aged care residences for over 2,600 residents, in-home care services to over 1,000 clients in their own homes, and retirement living operations.First established in 1993 with a single care residence in Toorak, BlueCross has grown to operate 32 aged care homes \u2013 the vast majority in metropolitan areas \u2013 and three independent living communities. The organization also assists elderly residents living in their own homes, and veterans with home care packages and care provisions. BlueCross operates with the support of over 4,000 employees and hundreds of volunteers.The Challenge: Accurate financial reporting to multiple areas of the businessThe finance team at BlueCross HQ manages business partnering across 32 aged care homes and the separate three independent living communities element. This operation requires a lot of work. Each month the finance team must provide a concise report, to the residence managers, on:what the Profit & Loss (P&L) is at each care home and where to focus financial effortsthe organization-wide benchmark each care home should be aiming for operationallywhat is working well at each care home (which may not be the case at another).The team also provides operational support across all financial matters relating to BlueCross to drive financial sustainability.Over time, it became apparent that the existing financial reporting process was a cumbersome and labor-intensive undertaking for the team. Data stored in large Excel files was already time-consuming to maintain. Building and presenting month-end reports created additional pressure; it could take up to a week to prepare, print, collate and add to an analog reporting book. The combined cost in time is significant. As well as faster, more reliable financial reporting, BlueCross is also looking to drive down labor costs, representing around 70% of the organization's total revenue.With the legacy system at BlueCross no longer fit for purpose, a new end-to-end solution was required to enhance financial reporting, budgeting, and data analysis \u2013 driving valuable data insight to each business unit owner more accurately and swiftly. The outcome of this project would reduce the overall cost of time, increase the delivery speed of month-end reporting and budgeting, and enable a more proactive and data-led approach to operations and decision-making.The Solution: Automation across financial reporting and analytics and increased business partneringFollowing a search for the right digital innovation, BlueCross looked to Board's Intelligent Planning Platform to deliver the required transformation across financial planning capabilities. After discussing project needs with Board consulting partner LightARC, the highly flexible nature of Board proved critical as a deciding factor for selection. More specifically, Board would enable several key processes to simplify work for the BlueCross financial team and offer an enhanced view across budgeting for all unit owners. For example, the ability to link any system within Board's platform provides a single point of truth to drive powerful data analytics.Additionally, Board's dashboarding and reporting capabilities enable the team to build rosters for each residential care home to give complete transparency over costs \u2013 quickly determining where the highest business costs are coming from and why. This level of support from the Board platform would ensure a smoother financial operation and simplified processes for the team moving forward.Discussing the project, \u00a0Paul O\u2019Mahony, General Manager Commercial Accounting at BlueCross, notes, \"We can break Board down into a couple of different big projects.\" Chief among these are labor analytics and financial reporting.Labor analyticsLabor at BlueCross is the highest financial cost, so having an intimate understanding of how labor impacts the business is critical for the finance team. Paul expands on this, \"Labour within our aged care business is about 80% of our cost, 70-80% depending on the month, and so the main prerogative of Board was to get labor analytics working and operational.\" Fortnightly reporting was requested for residence managers at the care homes to review fortnightly labor hours quickly vs. budgeted fortnightly labor hours, identify any variances, and tackle them immediately. Paul continues,\u00a0This was our initial priority, really. The process took about two to three months to complete \u2013 by the time we had identified the data, completed the data dictionary with LightARC, cleansed the data through the integration process in SQL, and introduced Board for analysis and screen building, and data validation.The labor analytics project results give the residence managers across the 32 care homes operating under BlueCross accountability for managing their labor.Financial reportingThe second critical project for BlueCross is a transformation across their financial reporting. The legacy process involved a physical reporting book prepared every month for a small number of senior executives. It would take a week for the finance team to prepare and bind them into the book. Paul reflects on this:I said to my team that we're not going to do this. This is something that we're just going to stop, automate, get all the reporting done in Board, and leave the executives to go to Board as they see fit and look at whatever reporting they needed. We did this very quickly, and it has saved my team about a week of just hard task labor; it's given my team real-time back into their day to be able to focus on their business partnering.The Benefits: A transparent one-stop-shop for financeThanks to the time Board has given back through automation, the financial team has increased meetings with residence managers from zero to 32 every month. \u00a0Business Analysts are now reinvesting their time to discuss several things that they simply could not before, such as what is working across the platform and what is not. Paul notes,It's about building the link between operations and central office, which is making them feel more connected to what's actually going on. It is also driving the real business partnering between finance and operations.For example, when they begin working for the organization, BlueCross care employees are allocated to a care home. During the initial six-month probationary period of employment, an employee may not physically work at that designated site. This means any accrued hours, such as annual leave or long service leave, are registered against the home they are allocated to when they have potentially not worked a single hour there. That home site's P&L increases as a result, so it does not accurately reflect its actuals. Paul says,We've been able to make sure that the dollars are following the staff and get a much more accurate reflection of what we're doing on a monthly basis, which I think is very, very important. It's all just there in Board.Another example looks at how Board positively changes payroll reporting through automation. The legacy payroll process took a long time in a large organization, such as BlueCross, operating across multiple sites with centralized financial reporting. One to two finance team members would spend up to a day and a half every fortnight preparing and sending payroll reports out of the system to each care home. These reports give insight into who worked at each site, so each residence manager can determine if they are paying the right staff from their care home's budget. Now, with the automation capability inherent in Board, reports are created in minutes.Annual leave and sick leave data are also automated as part of these fortnightly reports \u2013 giving clear feedback to the residence managers about who has worked where, how many days they have had off sick, and how many days holiday they have taken or have left. Armed with this information, residence managers have more control to look at staff who have, perhaps, taken more days off sick than they have holidays and dig into why this is the case. The result of these automated reports, as Paul notes, is that residence managers no longer need to,Bother looking at 600 people on a report. Instead, they can single out people with high annual leave and low sick leave and say these are the people who are not taking annual leave but taking sick leave; these are the people that we need to have a discussion with tomorrow.Through Board, residence managers now have a one-stop shop for everything they need from a financial perspective. Reports are delivered in a shorter time with easy-to-extract insights, providing more time to look at real-time information, comprehend it, and make any necessary adjustments within their care homes. Residence managers now have 21 days a month, on average, to make improvements versus the six days average they had in the legacy way of working.Board has now been rolled out to residence managers of all 32 care homes, who have reported that the flexibility and transparency seen across the system make it easy to use for non-financial staff. On the other side of this, the financial team notes a significant increase in business partnering functions because of report building automation and managing multiple reports to suit the different care homes under their jurisdiction. The transparency Board brings also means the finance team has a more comprehensive understanding of costs across the entire business.Board continues to be adopted as part of the day-to-day for users as the level of reporting has evolved. Paul says,Our engagement with the system has gotten better, and I think what we really see now is mass adoption at the operation space.\u00a0Board will become the differentiator for us because all of the residence managers have their data there. They know who's on leave, they know what their fortnightly hours are, they know who's going over, they know who is casual. Everything's at their fingertips.Control measures are now in place to stop people from accessing data from multiple homes, meaning residence managers and operations teams have a unique login tailored to their own home. These users access the Board financial reporting system, get a snapshot of their leave, labor, P&L, and so on, and understand their costs and where else they can spend.For example, BlueCross has created a dashboard for the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI), an Australian Government subsidy that can be claimed for each resident that has entered permanent care. ACFI is a crucial revenue generator for BlueCross, so having a dedicated screen for every care home gives the operational user(s) precise, real-time data whenever they need it. Paul notes,We've also streamlined all of their general ledgers on Board. They've got their ACFI; they've got their occupancy; they've got the resident data; they've got their labor data; they have allowances, leave, annual leave, sick leave, and general ledger data.Users on the Board platform are not limited to finance and operations. Three levels of access have been created to accommodate a hierarchy of need, based on the user's status within the organization:Executives: have access to a dashboard with full drill-down capability across the entire business.Operation Managers: have access to a dashboard on a home-by-home basis. General managers may have access to all homes with full drill-down capability, whereas residence managers will only access their care homes.Finance: have access to financial reporting dashboards across the business to deliver monthly reporting.This flexibility enables BlueCross users to be able to access the data pertinent to them. For example, some users will need to access data that exists on a per-home basis and holistically across the entire business. Paul explains,For example, you've got the General Manager of Allied Health, and they manage a hundred physios and occupational therapists across the business. They have full transparency of where their staff are across all the homes, and whether their costs have been appropriately allocated; built specific reports for them that get pushed out to their regional guys every month. So, they're getting good granularity and transparency out of it as well.Furthermore, having access to real-time labor analytics and information reduces the \"lag\" seen in the old fortnightly reports. Operational users can now access Board day by day to understand how their staff are working. For example, has someone taken sick leave on a Friday and again on a Monday for a long weekend? Has someone worked extra hours when the budget is set for them to work less? More power and time are given to residence managers to look at where they can make improvements.The future with BoardThe benefits seen with Board have given a lot of time and agility back to the finance and operations teams. It also bridges the gap between them in terms of communication and goal alignment.Integral to taking the use of Board ahead, the BlueCross finance team is working on mapping resident data. Currently, there are several weekly reports and a monthly KPI report run outside of Board. Collating the resident data and validating it within Board will add additional potential for automation. With financial reporting closed off within Board, the next natural step for the BlueCross team focuses on refinement. Paul says,We probably need to get a bit more control and a bit more understanding about our allowances. And then to me after that, from a financial perspective, we should be good to go.Following this fine-tuning piece, BlueCross's use for Board will extend beyond finance into a more operational platform \u2013 adding more automation to decrease inefficiency across the care homes and business. For example, service coordinators across the 32 care homes currently print off lists of every resident's name from one system. These lists are then manually entered into Excel spreadsheets and uploaded into another system. Not only is this a duplication of work, but it highlights the problems that exist when one system cannot talk to another.Paul succinctly notes,It kills me, that kind of inefficiency, and I really feel if we took the time to just sit with those people and work through what their daily tasks are, or what their weekly tasks are, there is 30% efficiency to be driven from linking our systems to make our operational model as it is now more efficient.In a final statement about Board, Paul sums up its implementation:I think we have a very good solution now that works well for us as a finance function. However, I would say that any reporting you already have, be prepared to turn it on its head and be a bit more fluid with it. Be prepared for some things that you weren't expecting. When you link data that doesn't have any linkage or link data you thought might have had no linkage before, be prepared for some things to give you a big shock. For us, we looked at sick leave and at annual leave, which we were expecting to give us a bit of information, perhaps about people who were being dodgy and going for sick leave instead of annual leave. But there have been several other things that have come out of that as well. We've been able to pinpoint staff well-being and do well-being checks with our employees. There are a number of things; ancillary benefits found with big data. Aged care, as an industry, probably isn't as well-known for its big data as retail and property \u2013 but I think we're getting there."

        "content": "Tetra Pak is a world-leading food processing and packaging solutions company. Working closely with its customers and suppliers, it provides safe, innovative, and environmentally sound products that each day meet the needs of hundreds of millions of people\u202fin more than 160 countries. The company believes in responsible industry leadership and a sustainable approach to business. Its promise \u201cPROTECTS WHAT\u2019S GOOD\u2122,\" reflects its vision to commit to making food safe and available, everywhere.\u00a0The Challenge:\u00a0Addressing\u00a0static\u00a0legacy processes across the finance function\u00a0Reflecting on a legacy way of working across the finance function, Tetra Pak required a solution to replace Excel spreadsheets and the static nature of collating and presenting financial data. Sergei Leschinsky, Director of Business Information Management at Tetra Pak, notes:One of the biggest issues with our old set up was it was time-consuming to create additional versions of financial plans.Manually administered spreadsheets took a long time to manage, leaving less time to add strategic value to planning activities.\u00a0The team at Tetra Pak\u00a0was\u00a0searching for\u00a0a tool that would enable agile planning simulations across the finance function.\u00a0Simultaneously, simulation capability\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0lengthy undertaking,\u00a0and\u00a0the results\u00a0could not\u00a0meet the fluidity and high demands of\u00a0modern markets.\u00a0Looking for a solution that would add new levels of speed and quality to their financial planning capacity, Tetra Pak began searching for the right software vendor. After evaluating the market, the company chose the Board Intelligent Planning Platform to take these requirements forward. The flexible nature of Board was a key deciding factor for the Tetra Pak team as they looked for a solution that would deliver transparency and increased efficiency while simplifying all stages of the financial planning process. Reflecting on the selection process, Sergei observes:Board's philosophy of how the product is built reflects our needs, at Tetra Pak, of how planning should work.Implementing Board quickly: Meeting internal deadlines\u00a0After the selection process, the Tetra Pak team had a\u00a0strict deadline of only three months\u00a0to implement the first version of the Board-based financial planning solution within their organization. Achieving this deadline involved ensuring that the Board consultancy team was aware of Tetra Pak's\u00a0financial planning approach\u00a0(to aid the onboarding process) and that both\u00a0the\u00a0internal\u00a0project team\u00a0and end-users at Tetra Pak could use the platform.\u00a0With a strong push from both sides, Tetra Pak initiated the project's first phase within the timeline. Sergei Leschinsky notes:\u00a0It was challenging, but flexibility is a key point that allows you to do what you want to do. Most of the time, you are stopped by pre-defined functionality restrictions of the product, and you need to find workarounds; you need to find non-standard solutions. This is where you lose a lot of time, but, with Board, I don't feel it is like this.The flexibility inherent within the Board platform was a key enabler for Tetra Pak to meet this time-sensitive requirement. Usually, it is quicker to build and implement a solution that completely reflects specific business requirements and internal working processes versus pre-configured solutions that force you to adopt vendor-designed processes into your organization.\u00a0Training of the project team at Tetra Pak, led by Board, was completed in under a week. The organization then conducted its own end-user training (initially with the finance team) in just a couple of days \u2013 quickly adopting a self-sufficient, highly independent understanding of the Board platform and how it would operate as part of the financial planning cycle. As Sergei notes:We used [Board] consultants to learn the tool, then we could build what we wanted in Board.The first stage of the project was completed within the three-month deadline with Board established as\u00a0a\u00a0part of the financial planning process.\u00a0\u00a0The Board\u00a0Platform:\u00a0A fully flexible approach to simulation and financial planning\u00a0Board\u00a0integrates\u00a0data from across\u00a0the\u00a0Tetra Pak organization,\u00a0including the\u00a0high volume of historical data stored in\u00a0other systems.\u00a0Collating this data in a fast, simplified way and adding\u00a0a new level of analysis was essential.\u00a0\u00a0Tetra\u00a0Pak's\u00a0financial planning process involves creating a rolling\u00a0plan.\u00a0Once a year, several iterations of this plan are created (optimistic, pessimistic, and\u00a0realistic)\u00a0before being presented to\u00a0senior\u00a0stakeholders\u00a0for review, modification, and sign-off.\u00a0The final\u00a0plan\u00a0at the end of this process\u00a0is\u00a0the baseline for\u00a0the following\u00a0year's\u00a0budget.\u00a0This rolling cycle\u00a0was previously\u00a0conducted\u00a0using a combination of linked Excel spreadsheets.\u00a0While this process\u00a0remained similar\u00a0following the implementation of Board,\u00a0Tetra Pak\u00a0was\u00a0keen\u00a0to introduce a more agile approach to analysis and What-If simulations.The initial Board rollout at Tetra Pak has replaced the Excel spreadsheets that previously slowed down financial planning. The actual process remains much the same: the finance team prepares several versions of a plan, they are reviewed and modified by the Office of Finance before being presented to senior stakeholders to undergo final changes, and then the official plan is agreed upon.\u00a0As part of this cycle, Board's real strength lies in its ability to simulate the impact of different scenarios and conduct What-If analyses. Sergei, on the power of agile simulation, says:It's another dimension. You can have nice processes and solid logic behind your planning, but if you cannot simulate \u2013 if you cannot take different assumptions and compare those assumptions \u2013 you have largely reduced the end result of your planning.For example, Tetra Pak (a global business) can now simulate different exchange rates in seconds to determine how these might impact financial results in the coming years. This new capability means that the planning cycle is even more accurate and realistic for the business. The finance team can also actively compare the different versions they create, in one place, as part of the planning cycle. This provides a far more holistic overview of the pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic plans they put together each year for review.\u00a0Customer Benefits:\u00a0Planning today and tomorrow as needed\u00a0Board gives\u00a0finance teams\u00a0more power to plan in a way that benefits them day-to-day, with the flexibility to work in the way the team desires. With the Board platform underpinning the\u00a0financial planning process, the Tetra Pak team has realized\u00a0various\u00a0advantages.\u00a0Ease of use\u00a0A lot of time is lost when new systems are hard to implement and hard to get everyone on board. With Board, this is not the case \u2013 the system is easy to use for administrators, application designers, and most importantly finance colleagues who enter, calculate, and analyze plan numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Complete\u00a0tool-kit\u00a0for\u00a0planning\u00a0Board provides all tools needed to connect and ingest data, create and update databases, process required calculations, set up user functional profiles and data access restrictions, and enter, present, and analyze plan numbers in a single environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Data model flexibility\u00a0The data model with Board is highly flexible and capable. Sergei discusses:There was never a discussion about limitations, or about having to reduce the number of dimensions,\" discusses Sergei. \"This was never a conversation we had to have with Board.Ultimately, a lot of data was integrated and uploaded into Board (with the added pressure of the internal deadline requirement).All of this work was done in two months which, for me, is a great justification that Board is easy to use and can be used across the business,Powerful calculation engine\u00a0Board's \"calculation engine,\" as Sergei puts it, offers a multidimensional database with robust analysis, planning, and forecasting capabilities. The engine performs simulations and evaluates the different scenarios inherent in financial planning. Sergei says:The whole process is so agile when you change a number and immediately see it reflected in the table or chart or whatever you are using.\u00a0The team at Tetra Pak is impressed by the power sitting behind the complex calculations performed within Board.\u00a0There is no need to require coding knowledge or pull together strings of\u00a0complicated\u00a0formulas\u00a0to create the calculation logic.\u00a0Agile simulation\u00a0The agility\u00a0required\u00a0for\u00a0building plans was\u00a0previously\u00a0held back by\u00a0a\u00a0relative\u00a0lack of\u00a0simulation ability\u00a0in\u00a0the legacy Excel-based way of working.\u00a0Tetra Pak\u00a0wanted\u00a0the ability\u00a0to run\u00a0simulations\u00a0faster\u00a0to\u00a0test scenarios and adapt\u00a0plans accordingly.\u00a0Sergei reflects:Simulating is a critical advantage in a changing business world. It is so easy to do those different versions and simulations in Board compared to our old Excel environment and way of working.Thanks to Board,\u00a0Tetra Pak has benefited from:\u00a0Enhanced decision-making in terms of quality and speed, mainly through Board's ability to perform What-If scenario simulations and analyses across critical financial plans.\u00a0Reduced\u00a0time spent preparing financial plans \u2013 mainly when adding simulation and analysis to the different versions of the\u00a0plan (which can now be done simultaneously in a comparable view).\u00a0\u00a0Increased the agility\u00a0of planning by combining different Excel models into an integrated business plan.\u00a0Improved the traceability of the organization's financial planning process in a data-led platform that provides\u00a0visibility across the finance function and a single point of truth.\u00a0Decreased the number of potential errors that can commonly be related to Excel-led planning and work.\u00a0Added the ability to quickly adapt and utilize calculation logic across the entire planning process.\u00a0To summarize the benefits seen at Tetra Pak, Sergei succinctly adds that Board offers:Full flexibility \u2013 you can do what you want!The future of Board at Tetra Pak\u00a0The opportunity for evolving the use of Board exists, thanks to the flexible nature of the platform.Our primary focus was to implement a solution for our financial planning process. But, looking at the tool, we immediately realized that it is not just a financial planning tool, it is a tool that can support decision-making \u2013 whether that is in finance or elsewhere,Sergei states. He continues:As soon as you model the data, as soon as you identify the logic and steps, and dimensions and calculations, you can implement Board for basically any process in your company.\u00a0We are very satisfied with the project. I personally would recommend Board because the flexibility and ability to fully cover particular business requirements is what we value in the solution."

        "title": "Leading supermarket cooperative optimizes wholesale planning to empower retailers and stores.",
        "company": "Edeka",
        "content": "EDEKA's success is based on the interplay of around 4,000 independent merchants throughout Germany who operate their stores under the umbrella of the cooperative EDEKA network. These merchants are supported by seven regional groups of companies, which supply them with goods as wholesalers, generate space as real estate developers, and ultimately build EDEKA stores for onward leasing. The regional groups also act as as a service provider, supporting the back office of the retail stores by offering a wide range of services including merchandise management, payroll accounting, data protection, and occupational safety. The EDEKA headquarters in Hamburg coordinates the cooperation of the companies within the group and develops purchasing and marketing strategies at a national level.\u00a0Challenge: High performance for smooth planningWith around 900 stores and a correspondingly wide range of goods, EDEKA Northern Bavaria-Saxony-Thuringia processes large volumes of data. Increasing demands, such as displaying tour utilization or logistics packing densities, had overloaded the company's legacy planning system and performance was no longer sufficient for a smooth operation.\u00a0The company's Excel-based planning processes had also reached their limits, with employees spending more time preparing the data than dealing with the information it contained.Christian Zirk, Head of Controlling at EDEKA Northern Bavaria-Saxony-Thuringia, describes the problem:\"If I enter figures and have to wait several minutes for the recalculation, then working with the system is not fun. To load larger amounts of data from SAP, we had to split the data volumes and had a loading time of about 24 hours.\" \u00a0Looking to overcome these challenges, EDEKA's Controlling department began to scope out requirements for a new system. The management board very quickly recognized the advantages of a different approach and approved the introduction of a new, more powerful solution for planning, reporting, and analysis.Solution: Integrated business and retail planning in a single platformAfter an intensive selection process, three vendors were shortlisted and invited to present a business case in a proof of concept. Board was selected as the solution of choice, as Christian Zirk explains:\u00a0\"There were several points that tipped the scales in favor of Board. For one, Board had the most technically mature solution. In addition to the necessary performance, Board offers features such as BEAM (Board Enterprise Analytics Modeling) for simulation and data prediction functions that enable predictive and advanced analytics based on intelligent algorithms. On the other hand, the Board team proved that they have a lot of experience in the retail sector when presenting the business case. This gave us a good feeling that we had the right partner on our side.\"\u00a0For EDEKA, it was also important that Board could be installed as an on-premise solution to avoid sensitive data, such as that relating to purchasing price decisions, being uploaded to the cloud. EDEKA Northern Bavaria-Saxony-Thuringia has its own data center, which was perfect for hosting the Board solution in-house. In this scenario, IT provides the hardware, while Controlling takes responsibility for the content of the Management Information System (MIS), which is now mapped by the Board platform.\u00a0\"We have our own development department in Controlling that takes care of the technical implementation. Therefore, it was obvious that we should implement the projects using a coaching model,\" says Christian Zirk. \u00a0In a coaching approach, Board's Professional Services Team supports the implementation and trains employees simultaneously, so that the company can quickly build up its own knowledge. The customer can then implement new requirements independently on the Board platform.\"Our goal is integrated business and retail planning with comprehensive reporting and in-depth analysis capabilities to ultimately improve processes,\" adds Christian Zirk.\u00a0Implementation: A phased approachEDEKA North Bavaria-Saxony-Thuringia began by setting up P&L planning and wholesale planning in Board. This was where the greatest need lay, as the previous solution had reached its limits. The wholesale merchandise management system provides data down to the individual article, allowing purchasing to be planned down to the item level. Among other things, this enables the analysis of special cases, such as breakages at the warehouse. \u00a0Reporting was set up in parallel. There is a close exchange with the planning department, so that ideas from reporting are always incorporated into the planning process. \u00a0Another important business area that was quickly brought into the Board platform is logistics. Here, the supply of almost 900 stores is planned. This is done at the unit or colli level. The new solution not only allows flexible and fast planning, but also provides an up-to-date view of service levels to answer questions such as \"how much have the stores ordered?\", \"how much has already been delivered before the due date?\", and \"how much of the ordered delivery will arrive on the expected delivery day?\" Since Board enables easy commenting on the planned figures, the stores also directly see the reasons for any delays. \u00a0Christian Zirk is particularly fond of Board's geomap feature:\"We have connected all of the stores' POS systems. With the help of geomapping, we can effectively display the sales in the stores and regions and see where we are particularly successful. We can monitor new store openings and analyze how the new store is doing and what impact it has on other stores in the region.\"\u00a0The Board project is still ongoing, with rental planning for the properties being the next phase of the project. This includes rental contract management for the stores, which has become too confusing in Excel. Investment planning in conjunction with SAP's Asset Manager is also on the agenda.\u00a0Many new ideas and requirements have come from the 220 users so far, who are enthusiastic about the performance and the possibilities that Board offers them. Christian Zirk reports:\"Users are flooding us with new ideas. Purchasing, for example, can see the invoiced sales, which are also displayed in diagrams that can be quickly grasped. Based on this, users would like to be able to add further figures and information. Other business areas that have been moving data back and forth in Excel would like to integrate their data into the platform as well. They ask when we can connect new upstream systems. Members of the cooperative are also very interested and come up with specific suggestions on what new topics we can include.\"\u00a0When asked what hurdles were encountered in the project, Christian Zirk has to think long and hard:\"It actually went and is going very well. Board is very convenient, but of course the entire structure is initially somewhat different from the previous system or SAP. You have to get used to that and adapt. However, the team at Board is very helpful. When we ask a question, we get answers very quickly. It's really a great collaboration.\"Benefits: More time, better alignment, and complete visibility\u00a0\u00a0EDEKA Northern Bavaria-Saxony-Thuringia is well on the way toward full integration of business and retail planning. In particular, the new planning functionality with direct month-end closing helps the Controlling deparment to keep up to date at all times. \u00a0\"We used to prepare a forecast 4 times a year. This was always preceded by lengthy agreements with the divisions. Now we have a rolling forecast that is always open. This means that everyone has access to the current status at all times,\" explains Christian Zirk.\u00a0The open forecast allows new values to be entered immediately. If a new employee or new investment is needed, this can be planned directly and the effects on the results are immediately visible. \u00a0The monthly closing can now be created directly from the planning. Whereas importing the data for the P&L used to take 90-120 minutes, it is now done in just a few minutes with Board. The departments involved particularly appreciate the fact that they can enter their comments directly in the P&L, saving long discussions and avoiding follow-up questions as all stakeholders have the necessary information at their disposal. \u00a0\"We have gained a lot of time that we are able to put into other activities. We can now think about which new applications will help us make processes even faster and then start developing them for ourselves,\" Christian Zirk concludes."

Sergio Del Pin, Group Controller, explains:\u201cHaving successfully reached the initial project objectives in the area of FP&A,\u00a0we decided to Board more progressively in other fundamental departments of the organization\u00a0such as sales & marketing, HR, logistics, warehouse management, and across our managerial area.\u201dThe Board Intelligent Platform at Poli Group is implemented for:FP&A, with fast closing capabilitycash-flow analysisproduct margins and variation margin analysissales planning & forecasting (by group/channel/brand/store)Analysis of labor rate variancesmeasuring the impact of inflationmanagement and operational reporting up to each individual SKU.Benefits: Vital data transformed to fast, smarter actionable insights across the enterpriseWith Board, Poli Group has considerably increased its ability to control performance, measure the efficiency of planning and analysis, and the evaluation of objectives.In the commercial planning and analysis area, Poli has adopted a precise and reliable analysis of internal and market data, considering and evaluating the impact of current promotional dynamics.The company has also optimized its assortment levels in stock management, and achieved a better understanding of warehouse movement trends using Board\u2019s cross-analysis algorithms.In the HR function, Poli can identify variations from year to year and provide a strategic view of individual stores, including analysis of employee career paths. Sergio Del Pin adds:\u201cThanks to Board, we are able to understand the wider story regarding personnel costs and how they impact the business. For example, how do indirect or hidden costs, unproductivity (illness, maternity leave), seniority-linked salary increases, and contract renewals all impact the bottom-line?\u201dPoli\u2019s management has achieved great benefits from the Board Intelligent Planning Platform. There is no a better coordination of management control among the various departments, subsidiaries, and roles within the group. Besides typical KPIs (inlcuding EBIT, EBITDA, ROI, and ROS), Poli Group now has enhanced control over performance-related KPIs that explore the relationship between sales and hours worked, sales per square meter per store, brand, and many other important points of information. Sergio Del Pin concludes:\u201cThe feedback from the people using Board has been very positive. I absolutely recommend Board! We did not find a platform with the same level of flexibility among its competitors.\u201dPoli Group is looking extend the use of Board even further in the near future. Plans include implementing ad hoc dashboards across the entire retail network to control the performance of each store. This kind of dashboard will present information about sales performances, HR trends, and customer portfolios(e.g. average customer spending and receipts analysis). The company aims to support the daily choices of each store manager by relying on a data-driven approach."

It operates 49 upscale hotels, resorts, and campsites with brands like Park Plaza, art\u2019otel, and Arena. Properties are located across 8 countries, totaling more than 9,400 hotel rooms and 6,000 campsite pitches. Listed on the London Stock Exchange, the company differentiates itself through its strong service delivery ethos and continues to grow via its integrated \u201cBuy, Build, Operate\u201d business model.The challenge: Planning in a disruptive hospitality marketPPHE is a long-term user of the Board Intelligent Planning Platform. The company\u2019s FP&A activities had already been transformed thanks to a successful Board financial reporting and analytics project in 2009 that was expanded into a strategic planning solution in 2017. These projects replaced rigid, inconsistent, manual processes with a single platform that offers the flexibility to examine numbers from different perspectives, identify changes in business patterns, and standardize management reporting. As a result, the time taken to carry out FP&A processes was radically reduced.At present, uncertain market conditions caused by global disruption continue to put the hospitality sector under pressure. Well-positioned to tackle this challenge head-on with Board, PPHE recognized an opportunity to maintain its competitive edge through data-driven decision-making based on both financial and operational data.The solution: An intelligent hospitality management platformEmbarking on a project to expand the existing Board-based FP&A solution to the wider organization, PPHE\u2019s finance team held a roadshow to discover the data expectations of key stakeholders. A total of 20 data sources were eventually integrated into the platform, including financial, operational, benchmark, online reputation, productivity, procurement, and ESG metrics relating to all of the company\u2019s locations.Using this combined data, the delivery of business reports was automated, the information within them enhanced, and KPIs analysis standardized across multiple regions and departments. The result is a unique hospitality management platform, built using Board, that provides 24/7/365 access to insights that drive the company forward. Highlights include:Weather statistics that are likely to impact restaurant and hotel performance, utility consumption, and seasonal demand.Staff time and attendance data combined with business volume metrics (such as occupancy) to identify under- and over-resourcing as well as improve plan resource allocation.Sustainability data on electricity, gas, city heating, and water consumption to enable a proactive approach to hitting ESG targets.Integration of semantic analysis data to track positive/negative sentiments on customer reviews and inform decisions around drivers such as restaurant menus.The benefits: Increased planning agility and smarter decision makingThanks to Board, PPHE makes more intelligent hotel management decisions every day. There are 170 active Board users (revenue managers, sales department, financial controllers, hotel managers)\u2014with many more receiving daily reports from the platform. PPHE is realizing many benefits from its business-wide Board expansion, including:More agile planning as accurate data is available in one place, reaches stakeholders faster, and flows seamlessly from budgets & daily forecasts into the strategic planning process.More informed decisions as operational and market insights complement financial statistics, highlighting correlations and potential improvement areas.Greater understanding of current demand thanks to near real-time data on factors such as room type, lead time, and average length of stay.Reduced administrative burden through automated reporting processes that free teams up to focus on looking ahead.Enhanced ESG efforts through visibility of hourly utility consumption by property and the ability to correct inefficiencies to reduce carbon emissions.Improved customer service as company-wide KPIs such as cleanliness, location, and value for money are always visible to each hotel, highlighting areas for improvement.Increased IT bandwidth thanks to the platform\u2019s ease of use. People are empowered to develop on their own\u2014without the need for IT involvement.The future: Automation and AILooking to innovate further, PPHE plans to bring even more insights to managers with Board. The finance team leverages the platform\u2019s user-friendly nature to own solution development internally, driving continuous improvement. Partner data portals will be integrated to enhance information availability, predictive analytics & AI will be introduced to provide fast, new insights, and process automation will be expanded to further reduce time spent on manual activities."

Quorn designs, manufactures, and sells its healthy protein products worldwide and has an annual sales turnover of around \u00a3220 million. The ethical, health, and environmental benefits of Quorn put corporate social responsibility at the heart of everything it does.\u00a0The Challenge: Manually intensive, spreadsheet-based forecastingFaced with time-consuming sales and financial forecasting processes that relied upon a huge number of spreadsheets and manual input, Quorn embarked on a project to find a better solution. Richard Garner, UK Sales Director at Quorn, explains:\"The tension of missing forecasts drove it [the project], but the time it was taking to produce a forecast also drove the decision. I think on average it took us four to five weeks to produce a proper bottom-up P&L, looking out to the end of that year. We spent more time forecasting than selling as a team.\"Quorn took the decision in 2012 to implement the Board Intelligent Planning platform to overcome these planning issues and hasn't looked back since.\"The Board platform is now integrated into everything that we do in running the commercial side of the business,\" says\u00a0Martin Lofnes, CFO at Quorn Foods. \"The sales team uses it to put in place a promotional plan and check whether it is going to work before it even comes anywhere near Finance. They rely on it to get information about their customer performance, both to feed back to customers and to make decisions internally about the business. From a financial point of view, it\u2019s the one version of the truth \u2013 it's where we go to make sure our financial information is accurate. So Board is at the heart, commercially, of how we plan and report at the business now.\u201dThe Benefits: Increased accuracy, agility, and insightQuorn now has a much more agile, efficient planning and forecasting process with Board as well as a single version of truth for business information, meaning decisions can be made with confidence. Benefits have been realized across multiple departments and members of the Quorn team describe their experiences below:\"I find that the Board application is very easy to use, it\u2019s Windows-based with drag and drop facilities for setting up reports and screens.\"\u00a0Zoe Franks, International Commercial Accountant\"We\u2019ve got to the point now where we can probably complete our month-end reporting process and understand performance within about two or three days, whereas previously it took probably eight. Even then we were never sure we really got to the right answer, so it\u2019s made a big difference.\"\u00a0Jim Darton, Head of Commercial Finance\u00a0\"When Richard and I sit down to review a promotional plan every month the sales team already knows what the returns are going to be, so they stop recommending promotions that aren\u2019t going to work. They don\u2019t have to rely on Finance to get that, so it\u2019s freed up my team to do better analysis and to do more.\u00a0All in all, sales forecasting is so integral all the way down the chain and it leads to improvements in business performance.\" Martin Lofnes, CFO.\"Probably the biggest benefit for us is that Board helps us plan better with our customers. Every year we go through joint business plan negotiations and several times a year those plans can be tweaked and renegotiated between us and our customers. What\u2019s really useful about this system is that we can produce scenario models, so we can make changes to promotions, distribution, or investment and see a\u00a0live view of what profit number that throws out at the end.\u00a0On a personal basis, it\u2019s allowed me to make better, more informed decisions and has\u00a0given me more time to try and add a more commercial spin to the new product development process.\" Richard Garner, UK Sales DirectorThe Partner: Simpson AssociatesThe Board project was implemented at Quorn by partner Simpson Associates, and Martin shares his views on the collaboration:\"I think the Quorn and the Simpsons team worked very well together. They gave us good advice all the way through, they saw the project through to the end, and to be honest they stuck to the original cost, which we were delighted with. So, very happy with Simpsons as an implementation partner.\"\"We benefited from the project management skills that Simpson Associates brought to the project itself. They certainly helped keep us on the straight and narrow,\"\u00a0added Richard."

        "content": "bofrost* Spain leads the Spanish market in the home sale of deep-frozen products. The supply chain at Bofrost* begins at the origin of each product and ends on the plate of its customers to delighting even the most demanding palates.The challenge: Optimizing generation, management, and control of financial and sales reportingManagement at bofrost* embarked on a digital transformation journey, especially after the peculiar period experienced during the height of the pandemic, to identify areas of the business requiring improvement and to add agility and robustness to deal with market issues. In the Office of Finance, management were increasingly aware of the evolutionary role finance must play \u2013 evolving their roles from mere \u2018number crunchers\u2019 and accountants to fully-fledged business partners able to help the company be more data-driven and growth-oriented. As Jesus Bustos, Head of Finance, Controlling & Accounting at bofrost* recalls: \"We wanted to evolve our Office of Finance from a data collector and control-tower to a multi-layered, holistic center that promotes collaboration across the business. In a nutshell, we wanted to move from being mere data reporters to providers of competitive advantages.\"All this is achievable by transforming the financial team into a strategic asset that leverages their skills in FP&A, rather than data keepers and \u2018Excel collectors\u2019 \u00a0of isolated spreadsheets.The project: From basic FP&A to Intelligent PlanningThe bofrost* project mainly consists of an Enterprise Performance Management solution (EPM) built with the Board Intelligent Planning Platform and fully connected to an SAP ERP. The starting point was an annual plan that had to be reviewed based on monthly reports and marked by an expiration date. The first issue was to overcome the limited view of their planning processes. Jesus Bustos notes:\u201cBefore adopting Board as our EPM solution, we only saw a sum of data as the end of our planning cycle. Our financial professionals had to spend their time working and re-working the information. Thanks to the Board platform, the Office of Finance can provide business values across bofrost*.\u201dThe Board EPM solution evolved into Intelligent Planning, resulting in an advanced FP&A combining strategic and financial planning with meaningful information accumulated from all areas of the company, including sales & marketing, operations, production, HR, and supply chain.After the success of this implementation, bofrost* decided to integrate the Board EPM solution with its CRM to generate reports and dashboards that link categories of customers and revenue, based on different time periods. Bustos concludes:\u201cOur customized CRM is based in Italy and is used daily by more than 450 Sales Reps. Now, everyone can read and share their insights of sales data, without overabundance or \u2013 on the contrary - lack of information. Thanks to Board, our ideal approach to data has become concrete.\u201dBelow, an overview of bofrost*\u00b4s Board solution:The benefits: A digital workroom for the entire companyAfter the implementation of Board, bofrost* experienced many relevant advantages, like:Being a counsellor and an advisor tool for the bofrost*\u2019s board of directors and strategic decision makers, evolving finance professionals into business partners.\u201cWith Board, we have created a digital workroom for C-level, where they can take the most from dashboards and sales analytics\u201d \u2013 commented Bustos.Data Ownership through the BI capabilities of an Intelligent Platform.\u201cThe standardization of data in real-time is fundamental for a mobile food service and deliveries like ours\u201d \u2013 said Bustos. \u201cIndeed, we can rely on a Sales Analysis and Reporting application already embedded with the Board Intelligent Planning Platform, without worrying about exporting commercial data from SAP\u201d. Time saving, reducing manual work on spreadsheets across all departments, thanks to FP&A processes automation.Ensuring productivity and efficiency of FP&A processes and expanding these benefits across all the organization\u2019s areas.Promoting cooperation among C-level, Office of Finance, Sales & Marketing, Operations, and HQs.Being a driver of change for the entire Company."

        "company": "Mahou-San Miguel",
        "content": "A family-owned Spanish company, Mahou San Miguel (MSM) is the sector leader in the country with a production share of 32%. It has 10 brewery centers worldwide (eight in Spain, two in the USA, four water springs accompanying its bottling plants, and a professional team of more than 4,000 people.The firm's history dates back more than 125 years, beginning with the birth of Mahou in 1890. Following continued growth, it now has an extensive portfolio of Spanish beers, including Mahou Cinco Estrellas, San Miguel Especial and Alhambra Reserva 1925; pioneering products in their category, such as San Miguel 0,0, Mahou Barrica and San Miguel ECO; and brands suitable for coeliac sufferers such as San Miguel Gluten Free and Mahou Cinco Estrellas Sin Gluten. It also offers an extensive range of international beers including Corona, Budweiser, and Leffe courtesy of agreements with partners including AB InBev and Warsteiner, and mineral water brands such as Sol\u00e1n de Cabras.Internationalization is one of the company\u2019s strategic cornerstones for development. It produces more than 70% of Spanish beer consumed worldwide and has a presence in over 70 countries.\u00a0From Sales & Operations Execution to Collaborative Sales & Operations PlanningMSM aims to maintain its position as a key player and reference in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector at an international level, whilst leading the natural and authentic beverage categories in which it competes in the Spanish market. To do this, the company\u2019s management team began a digital transformation effort that focused on the use of innovative technology to leverage information as a competitive advantage, alongside their traditional value of placing consumers and employees at the center of their decisions.Managers began by looking at the Sales & Operations process, searching for technology that would help the business evolve from Sales & Operations Execution (S&OE) to Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP), extending the timeframe of the plans. They wanted to move from an executional way of working to a perspective and proactive approach. Once a mature S&OP process had been established, the company decided to improve it further by combining forecasts from across the organization. As Marina Anton, S&OP Lead at MSM, recalls:When we ran our first S&OP, we realized that we were collecting forecasts in different ways, mainly through Excel spreadsheets based on the inputs of different teams. That was quite unstructured, and the focus of our forecasting process was only on the current month or the next month at the most. Therefore, we decided to create a cross-functional team to be sure that all the company was involved in the data collection process and the S&OP was not driven just by one or another team.The new solution had to provide a collaborative environment where the conversations were about the value, i.e., the impact of the volumes on the business, rather than just the mere quantities. Additionally, given the complexity of MSM\u2019s product portfolio, the management team needed a platform capable of easily segmenting and analyzing their portfolio to support a more reactive and responsive way of planning.\u00a0Shifting from volume to value with an Intelligent Planning PlatformAfter an evaluation of several software solutions, MSM opted for the Board platform because they founded it very agile, oriented to business, and user friendly:The most important thing we recognized was that Board allows us to jump from volume to value conversations: through the decision-making platform we are able to translate our information into value, for both the company and our customers, says Marina.The first stage of the process involves the collection of all the volumes of the sales forecasts for the coming months, including information about sales promotions. This is done through a combination of automated and manual input. Once all the data is consolidated within the Board platform, the management team can generate all the P&Ls per channel, considering eight value criteria or dimensions such as account managers or SKUs. Finally, using the same sets of volume and value data, the company can generate different business scenarios through Board\u2019s simulation capabilities.Board is our single point of truth for our sales forecast figures and all teams are now aligned in one single forecast. That allows us to focus on value because we can evaluate the impact of the volume forecasts in financial terms. Besides, our product portfolio\u2019s complexity can easily be segmented through Board\u2019s analytics capabilities and consequently our S&OP process as well, Marina continues.The S&OP process supports a consensus meeting every month, where the sales team validates a three-month forecast and evaluates the activities based on corporate KPIs, all within one platform \u2013 Board. Collaboration has been significantly increased as a result and the team has been empowered by the complete visibility they have of performance. This was particularly beneficial in the wake of COVID-19 with physical meetings unable to take place.\u00a0Extending S&OP to Integrated Business PlanningAfter achieving a structured S&OP cycle, the company decided to extend the use of Board by evolving the S&OP process into an Integrated Business Planning (IBP) approach that involves Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Logistics executives. These key stakeholders have joint responsibility in the forecasting process. As Marina explains,We moved forward from an S&OP to an IBP process with our Executive S&OP meeting focusing on 12 or 18-month forecasting, combined with scenario management driven by Board. That helps us to anticipate risks and opportunities across our demand process, and proactively navigate through what is coming, also simulating our forecast figures to understand the volume impact on our P&Ls in different ways. Furthermore, these forecast simulations help our Sales team \u2013 and the entire Company as well \u2013 to better understand the market needs, resulting in better conversations with customers.This move from S&OP to IBP has given MSM several other great features and benefits, such as what they call \u201cthe IBP tracker\u201d, i.e., a Board integrated reporting application that allows the company to compare the forecasting numbers against, for example, the previous year. Through it, they can understand the volume impact from an economic and strategic perspective. As Marina notes, the company has achieved many benefits with the new solution:Thanks to the IBP approach introduced by Board, our forecast is easily translated into Net Sales and Gross Margin. The forecast validation and KPI evaluations are not kept at our Sales team levels,but extended up to our Executive levels. These activities are not static anymore because they consist of a live process that provides rolling forecasts. Also, the reporting and our management information system have really improved: the creation and management of reports is all self-service, within the same planning and simulation environment of the Board platform, where all the required information is available.MSM is going to further expand the use of Board to make the most of the Integrated Business Planning approach. The company wants to drive its financial budgeting and planning process by combining it with the strategic plan and a production capacity plan, all within the Board platform."

        "company": "Rummo",
        "content": "Pastificio Rummo started their history in 1846 in Benevento when Antonio Rummo took up the art of wheat milling before progressing swiftly into pasta production.Now in its sixth generation, the Rummo family is still committed to producing superior-quality pasta. With passion and dedication, the Rummos have perfected and patented an exclusive method known as Lenta Lavorazione\u00ae (\"slow processing\").In 2013, the company decided to revolutionize its traditional production strategy, which is focused on private labels to promote the Rummo brand based on the Lenta Lavorazione\u00ae method. The company decided to improve all production, distribution, logistics, and sales functions to establish its standing at an international level:From our starting point as a regional business, we have expanded throughout Italy to become one of the leading players in the premium segment, explains Claudia Nicora, Financial Controller at Rummo. \u201cWe have stepped up our exports a lot too, and now reach 62 countries worldwide, the most important of which are France (where we rank second in the sector nationally, and first in terms of supermarkets in the Paris region), and Switzerland, where we rank second, after Garofalo. Rummo emerged as Italy\u2019s favorite premium pasta brand in 2020.The Group is made up of four companies: Rummo S.p.A., Pasta Castiglioni S.r.l. \u2013 a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rummo \u2013 and two foreign subsidiaries, one in France and one in the US. Despite this multi-faceted structure, the group decided to implement an Intelligent Planning platform that would provide an all-round view and significant insights into business performance. It will, by doing this, go beyond the accountancy-based understanding it had with the information at its disposal. Rummo\u2019s Office of Finance proved a forward-looking, early adopter of a concept commonly seen in successful organizations, where finance professionals play a more active role in business decision-making. Acting as fully-fledged business partners, with a strategic role in achieving business objectives, the Office of Finance transforms into an essential department for the organization rather than accountants with a primarily record-keeping administrative role.In fact, explains Claudia Nicora, we approach our organization as if it were a single entity that sells to third parties. That way, we can analyze and assess what our profits are at a global level. Board gives us a \u201cmanagerial\u201d vision of the group\u2019s financials, which we then share with the organization.Italian excellence in the food industry starts with planningManagement control fulfills its strategic role entirely by opening the analysis and planning phases to the organization\u2019s other departments, involving the various managers in an end-to-end decision-making process. As a result, Rummo decided not to centralize all sales budgeting activities in the hands of the management control team but to delegate a substantial part of the planning to various managers in the sales force. However, the sales force has a complex organization chart, both in Italy and abroad, involving direct employees and agents reporting to them. Claudia Nicora explains,The two main players in our sales planning process are management control and sales. This means that the stakeholders in the sales area feel a keen sense of responsibility for the quality and integrity of the data they provide to controllers and management. It also means that we have complete visibility of how sales data not of a strictly economic-financial nature (e.g. volumes) impacts our bottom line.To produce the sales budget, the heads of management control at Rummo use the definitive data history as a starting point to build a range of business scenarios, making full use of Board\u2019s platform features from the outset:When building our sales budgeting process, we had a head start because we had already implemented Board software for the financial closing part,\u201d explains Claudia Nicora. \u201cThis means we not only have a comprehensive information baseline for financial data analysis and reporting (e.g. budget vs. actual) up to the contribution margin, but it also means we can allocate certain values to specific months and specific items defined at a higher level in the budgeting process.The sales budget scenario covers 12 months or modulates to generate forecasts. In other words, an account is taken of completed (\u201cclosed\u201d) months and the remaining \u201copen\u201d months to be planned. The budget is then revisable based on actual data from the \u201cclosed\u201d months. The Rummo Group opted to do planning at customer and item level, but, as Claudia Nicora points out, the Board platform has all the necessary flexibility to plan at any other level:The sales managers usually enter data at product line level (e.g. traditional pasta, wholegrain pasta, sauces, etc.), rather than single item level, saving time and keeping the focus on strictly commercial activities. Once they have entered this data, the Board platform automatically assigns values to items on the underlying levels, according to allocation criteria calculated on definitive data. Board\u2019s flexibility also enables us to choose a different approach to planning, depending on whether it relates to major supermarket chains, which we plan by the customer, or other sectors such as wholesalers, which we plan by sales channel.Once the planning level is defined, new items and customers not listed in the database can be added. This way, if a new product is due to be launched on the market, such as a new sauce, Rummo\u2019s controllers will agree with marketing about adding it to the budget. This means stakeholders from sales & marketing are also involved in the sales planning process, which is a big plus because they are best placed to know the sales potential of a new item.If you change the packaging or trade name of a product, you can still treat it as a new item in Board. The advantage of this is that you can associate the new item with the previous one and not lose historical volumes and comparisons with the other historical information, adds Claudia Nicora.Similar features on the customer side can be activated to manage new customers in the budgeting phase or to exclude previous ones if no sales volumes are associated with that customer in the planning scenario.But that\u2019s not all,\u201d notes Nicora. \u201cIf you want to add a new customer to your budget and you don\u2019t have all the essential information for that customer yet (e.g. the business name of a customer in Japan), you can create a generic new customer directly in the Board model and allocate the corresponding volumes and sales to it.Once these elements have been defined and the sales budget scenarios have been created and assessed, the next step in the planning cycle is handled by sales reps who have access to a simple, intuitive, dedicated workflow in Board. Here they determine the assortment for each customer based on historical data of products and the volumes purchased by each. According to their forecasts, the reps also add new items or product lines and remove specific items from the assortment.Once the assortment is completed,\u201d continues Nicora, \u201cthe sales reps begin planning the volumes by product line (e.g. gnocchi, wholegrain pasta, traditional pasta, and so on). The lines are based on what the sales department determines as the correct percentage for products sold as promotions for the whole planning period. Although the previously logged promotion is usually confirmed, Board also provides the option to modify these details according to any promotional peaks expected during the year.Volume planning is followed by revenue planning also by product line. Board lets you enter the price list by individual customer or product line (from Gross to Net) and set a discount that will automatically apply to all volumes designated as promotional volumes by the sales department. Nicora adds:Board enables sales to manage non-billing aspects such as contractual matters, fixed bonuses, flyers, co-marketing activities, preferential exposure, and fixed sell-out figures. These are all then plannable at total customer level or even at individual product line level.Another essential aspect planned by sales staff is the listing, a substantial part of the budget dedicated to listing bonuses activated when new items are added to a customer\u2019s portfolio within the assortment.Primary responsibility for the sales planning process goes back to management control. Once the sales force has completed its workflow, the Net is generated to be later analyzed at a single customer level or single product line level. It is then compared with respective historical status. The controllers now take care of cost planning by valuing all the relevant business costs and involving the various company functions \u2013 from the HR Manager to the Purchasing Manager \u2013 who provide the cost components:For the cost of goods sold, we decided to \u201cexplode\u201d the bills of materials on each item to obtain a visual representation, which includes a valuation across all components of the bills of materials. For example, the purchasing department tells us the cost of the raw materials, such as semolina. It gives us an overview of the cost of packaging, such as cardboard, so that \u2013 if it goes up or down \u2013 we can use Board to automatically manage the percentage change for all the costs whose parts include that particular type of semolina or cardboard.The Rummo Group also uses cost-planning features on Board for costs in marketing, advertising, or HR, as well as variable costs (i.e. costs that depend on sales volumes). Board allocates fixed costs, such as staff costs, to customers or products based on key drivers that primarily relate to sales volumes or revenues.Once Board has processed these costs and allocated them at line/product level, we get an income statement which we can drill-down to the individual customer or product line that interests us,\u201d explains Nicora. \u201cThe flexibility of Board\u2019s reporting on the income statement enables us to prepare the reports we need. For example, a report with contribution margins for all our customers.A single software recipe for multiple flavors of planningRummo Group\u2019s use of Board for sales planning and analysis has yielded many significant benefits, not just for the finance and sales areas \u2013 the leading players in sales budgeting \u2013 but also for other departments. A structured process is established, built jointly with all the company functions from purchasing to logistics, and marketing to HR.Switching from Excel spreadsheets to Board has been very useful. It helps us get the various budget stakeholders involved and enables them to provide controllers and the sales department with significant input. It also informs us of forecasted spending for each planning scenario. All of this is regulated by deadlines monitored in the workflow built with Board, making them easier to adhere to, observes Nicora.Another impressive advantage of Board is the platform\u2019s ability to generate a long-term view of company performance, thanks to its combination of planning, analysis, and scenario modeling.Nicora adds,The new approach we have adopted with Board helps us understand the impact of fluctuations in the costs of specific raw materials or the impact of specific marketing investments, along with a lot of other financial and non-financial information. This enables us to identify the best action to take to keep up the company\u2019s profitability.Rummo makes full use of Board\u2019s Intelligent Planning platform for other purposes too. These include managing a range of budget or forecast scenarios in a way that ensures comparability and managing and making effective use of data to create detailed reports and analyses with various levels of depth and granularity.Our annual business reviews are much easier and more streamlined; now we can make comparisons with previous planning scenarios. We start from existing scenarios and modify them according to current needs,\u201d adds Nicora. \u201cOn top of this, heads of management control monitor the flow and input of data from the sales force to monitor data quality. This gives them more control over potential errors.Rummo\u2019s Board-based innovation journey does not stop there. In subsequent implementation phases, financial planning and cash flow planning are integrated with the sales budgeting process.We want to set up a top-down monthly collation function, managed mainly by the sales managers. This new feature will provide a preparatory step for financial planning and cash flow planning, explains Claudia Nicora.This monthly collation system also improves the comparisons between the monthly income statement and the monthly budget to enable short-term performance monitoring concerning annual business objectives.Additionally, Rummo\u2019s management has decided that Board is the best solution for producing budgets with a more accountancy-biased focus, given the platform\u2019s outstanding adaptability to the specific needs of individual entities.Although it is beneficial to consolidate our legal entities into a Single Version of the Truth, encompassing all the relevant group information, external stakeholders nonetheless ask us for budgets and reports by an individual legal entity. Board enables us to meet the needs of the group and the needs of each subsidiary alike."

The group is listed on the stock market, operates in about 50 countries, and has over 3,500 staff.Boiron has always passionately and rigorously committed themselves to developing homeopathy worldwide. The company pursues this aim with a vision of health based on the motto of \u201ctreating without harming\u201d \u2013 using safe and reliable homeopathic medicines, food supplements, and health products with a devotion to a personalized approach that puts the patient centre stage.Boiron has a dedicated subsidiary in Italy with a staff of 170.Customer Profileoperations in 50 countries with 21 subsidiaries and distributors3 production sites (in France)3,500 staffover 300 million patients worldwide, taking homeopathic medicinesover 400,000 health professionals worldwide, practicing homeopathyproduct range of over 2,500 itemsmarket of 24,000 pharmacies, including OTC pharmacies and wholesalers\u00a0The cornerstones of optimum planningAs a group subsidiary, Boiron Italia is highly structured in terms of business processes. Closely connected with the production side of the business, which mainly takes place in the group\u2019s facilities in France, the Italian headquarters is structured to handle distribution, commercialisation \u2013 including both the sales networks and medical/scientific information networks \u2013 and the full range of business support activities carried out by the headquarters. This involves a substantial amount of planning, reporting, analysis, and forecasting to meet pharmaceutical market requirements.Boiron has a very varied product range, made up of about 2,500 items and a very broad customer base \u2013 consisting of pharmacies, over-the-counter (OTC) pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesalers,\u201d explains Stefano Deiana, Head of Management Control at Boiron Italia. \u201cWe operate in the OTC pharmaceutical sector (among others), which is a very competitive market, subject to volatile demand and substantial fluctuations in prices and business activities. Effective management and planning are therefore vital in our sector.Over the years, Boiron Italia\u2019s Management Control team has identified certain key requirements for its organization. Firstly, they always need full control and full knowledge of the company situation. Planning and analysis, with this in mind, are backed up by consistent, complete information regarding sales, distribution, production, operations, and economic and financial performance. As Stefano Deiana explains,Our reports \u2013 which also go to the group\u2019s general management \u2013 need to combine an overview, on a large enough scale to be meaningful at company and top management level, with detailed breakdowns right down to individual item level.It is also extremely important for Boiron to provide reports quickly, with the information set out in a flexible yet accurate and certified way. Speed is vital because the Boiron Group is stock market listed so must legally interact with the markets transparently. Additionally, when working in a highly competitive industry, speed keeps organizations ahead of the curve in market trends, a major business advantage.All of these management requirements are incorporated into the planning process, as Stefano Deiana explains:Starting with the plan, we proceed in line with it and analyse deviations periodically, so that we can react and re-plan accordingly, on the principle of continuous improvement. This is why, over the years, our planning and forecasting process has increasingly come to involve all business services, and efforts have been made to integrate them. So, Board\u2019s Integrated Business Planning (IBP) approach proved a perfect match for our approach.Areas for improvementPlanning at Boiron Italia is done by the Management Control team. The process begins with a business plan which is then incorporated into a budgeting process. This starts from the sales budget; inputs for all other business areas cascade down from it. This enables Boiron Italia to determine budgets for logistics, (with a forecast of procurement and a valuation of the cost of goods sold), human resources and personnel administration, and other key business functions for all company departments.At the same time as adopting this planning process, the Management Control team also introduced an organizational change: each service became responsible for the budget for each of its cost centres, explains Stefano Deiana. \u201cIt\u2019s not until a later stage that we in the team collect all the information (figures and feedback) sent to us by the departments, carry out the various analyses, and create a concise income statement. This enables us to send a summary to general management, setting out all necessary information to be able to make quick decisions, as well as focusing on the essential points that need to be raised with the group\u2019s management.To support this planning process, Boiron Italia used to have an IT architecture and workflow that was well structured but hampered by the technological limitations of legacy solutions before Board. In particular, there were difficulties in the forecasting phase which slowed the delivery of annual forecasts. Ideally, there should have been \u00a0one forecast per month, but with the legacy platform it was more realistic to produce three forecasts per year. The problem stemmed from each department processing its own data in a different application and then had to transferring it to the main system in order to have access to the other tools required to complete the forecast. In the specific case of the sales area, the previous system was too rigid, as Stefano Deiana recalls:\u201cOn the previous system, it was not possible to make changes in the selected product-customer forecast level. But in our industry, in many cases, being able to focus on an individual item or on certain clusters makes a huge difference in understanding market trends. That\u2019s why we had to use countless Excel worksheets, which then had to be put back into the main system.\u201dCost management presented a similar problem. Using a different module on the previous system, Management Control used to provide a \u201ccost sheet\u201d for entering the costs of each department. Once the data is received, the Management Control team then enters the proposal and reference data for the forecasts, provided by the managers of each department, \u00a0using a range of different applications. Finally, after collecting the forecasts, Management Control consolidates the data from the different applications. Each data input operation was highly time consuming but, more importantly, it was difficult to maintain consistency and quality of data across the large number of input operations.It was a long and laborious process,\u201d says Deiana. \u201cBecause of all these data input operations, accounts could easily get out of balance, compromising certification and data quality, and causing unacceptable delays in the processing of final forecast reports. Basically, it used to take about a month to complete this type of process. While this might have been acceptable at the budget stage, it was way too long to wait for forecasts during the year, so we only managed to do two or three forecasts per year, rather than meeting our target of one new forecast every month. In an industry like ours, where things change very suddenly, it was vital to speed the process up and shorten forecasting times to just a few days. Put simply, if planning information was not made available before the end of the month, it was too late.Further to this, if, with the old system, one of the revenue assumptions set out at the beginning of the month changed, \u00a0which was highly likely in such a volatile business environment, the Boiron team did not have the flexibility to change planning easily. All too often, the team would have \u00a0\u00a0to go back to the beginning and retrace the input of operations again, including all the aforementioned issues with this.Flexible planning with uncompromising data qualityOnce the problems and areas for improvement had been identified, Boiron Italia decided to make a start on design work with SDG, a Board partner, while simultaneously undertaking a software selection process to identify the planning, forecasting, and reporting solution that would best meet the company\u2019s needs. The Management Control team set about drawing up a list of imperatives:We established a number of essential features that the planning process had to have,\u201d recounts Deiana. \u201cFirst of all, we wanted to implement a single work environment to be shared between all departments, so that we wouldn\u2019t have to transfer data between departments, \u00a0and so that we could share the same database and work together on the same information assets. Secondly, we needed a more agile and efficient system of workflow management. Lastly, we need the system to be capable of working very fast, with information updates at daily intervals. To meet these criteria, the planning solution had to deliver very high performance, both in terms of flexibility and automation.It was extremely important to have flexibility at forecasting level. The sales team and Sales Director need to be able to adjust the volume they produce forecasts, so that \u2013 depending on the period and the prevailing business requirements \u2013 they could focus on product groupings or individual items, or on client\u00e8le clusters or specific customers. But this flexibility had to be achieved without compromising data consistency. As Deiana explains:We needed a robust tool that wouldn\u2019t force us to choose between flexibility and data quality \u2013 we wanted both! And this was possible with Board. Other solutions on the Performance Management and BI market often prioritise flexibility, to the detriment of information consistency; or prioritise data structure, to the detriment of flexibility of analysis and vision. What\u2019s more, the tool we were looking for had to have automated capabilities, both for information management and for the process of allocation, by means of drivers, to ensure rapid forecasting and hence prompt action on the market.The Management Control team oversee the applications built on Board, since \u00a0they are responsible for managing and supervising the entire planning process. However, Board is used throughout the organization, across all departments including the \u00a0Office of Finance. One of the strengths of the Board platform is its ability to combine strategic and financial analysis and planning with non-financial and operational analysis and planning.It\u2019s not easy to get people who don\u2019t deal directly with management control involved in economic matters, but over the years we\u2019ve managed to build a common language,\u201d points out Deiana. \u201cI have to say that even the departments most reluctant to be involved at first now appreciate having a panel on Board that enables them not only to keep track of the economic aspects of their budget but also to plan their own activities.Each Department Manager is in charge of the budgeting process within their area, which helps to promote a corporate culture of accountability in relation to cost control and management.Board has been a huge help to us in getting the departments \u2013 even the ones least connected with Management Control \u2013 to understand the importance of cost control,\u201d explains Deiana.Being directly responsible for managing their own economic impact on business performance has made the stakeholders of decision-making processes, even those not specifically related to finance, more accountable,- says Daniel Levasseur, CIO at Boiron Italia. - In fact, this is one of the advantages of Board\u2019s design: it has a flexible, intuitive interface that means it can be used effectively in the most finance-related environments, as well as in the IT department and in the more operational areas.The IT architecture for planningThe implementation of Board at Boiron Italia followed two fundamental prerequisites from the IT point of view: integration and data quality. As far as integration is concerned, Boiron\u2019s aim was to combine multiple applications and platforms into a macro-system, where Board would play a pivotal role, without having to adapt business processes to the information systems and software applications. Instead, Board would do the opposite and \u00a0\u00a0shape the tools to be used around the business logic they are designed to serve.The architecture on which information management, planning and analysis is now based at Boiron reflects the requirements of the organizational and decision-making processes and the activities that people carry out in practice on a daily basis,\u201d says Daniel Levasseur. \u201cThe integration between the various systems and solutions is not merely technical, in other words transferring data from one platform to another; it\u2019s something much more significant. Basically, it\u2019s a single working environment, which combines cloud-based systems and applications (designed mainly for Group use at international-level) with local systems and applications (relating to the Italian subsidiary only, for example), without sacrificing continuity or sharing, where information is exchanged automatically, without the need for any manual intervention.With its unified environment, Board has become a key platform that Boiron could immediately take advantage of. Board brings a new approach to unification, logic standardization, and process automation. Just as Board enables analysis, planning, and forecasting across all data collected across all organizational stakeholders in the decision-making processes, Boiron\u2019s information ecosystem is based on a solid, comprehensive data baseline.The second prerequisite noted above, data quality, \u00a0is supported by a high-performance Data Warehouse:We see the Data Warehouse as more than just a repository for \u201craw\u201d data. For us, it\u2019s a place for storing cleaned, corrected data in a structured way, ready for use in subsequent operations,\u201d continues Daniel Levasseur. \u201cIn view of the complexity of our information assets, in fact, we have decided to make every effort to have a Data Warehouse with certified, monitored, secure information, with which to build data marts and other analysis objects.With a solid database, Boiron can group together and consolidate information from certain business-related areas, according to the company\u2019s needs, to use for analytics, planning, and forecasting on the Board platform. Data governance and data quality remain cornerstones to this approach.\u00a0At information level, Board is fed by the Boiron Data Warehouse, through the company ERP (JD Edwards) and CRM. In turn, Board feeds the Data Warehouse with data processed on the Decision-Making Platform. There is a Single Version of Truth, which, among other things, eliminates the time-consuming operations and errors caused by redundant manual data entry tasks. Even our auditors were impressed by the quality of our Data Warehouse and the systemic architecture, of which Board is one of the main solutions - Levasseur points out.The Board project took about 8 months to implement (from kick-off to go-live), which is quick, in the opinion of Boiron\u2019s CIO, considering how ambitious the project was. The Intelligent Planning Platform was incorporated into a complex macro-system of solutions to extend its use across mutliple areas and company functions, including all cost centre managers. In the words of Boiron\u2019s CIO:The Board project was very agile in the way it progressed. It consistently followed the roadmap we had outlined for Boiron, and \u2013 even more importantly \u2013 it never interrupted our budgeting and forecasting processes.\u00a0 In fact, we managed to remain fully functional even during the platform deployment. This also enabled us to carry out a kind of double-check with production, to work out which aspects of planning and analytics applications to adapt and improve, according to the needs of the organization. During the completion of the project, we therefore had a \u201cturnkey\u201d system.Flexibility at workThe planning environment in Board is shared. Managers of each planning area (such as sales or logistics) see their \u201cworld\u201d profiled to a certain level of access and visibility (partly due to company privacy policy) according to their dedicated user profile. This does not mean everyone is closed off in their own area; sharing is made possible by a summary panel. Instead, everyone is responsible for their own planning area to ensure that the decision-making processes are not fragmented. In fact, the Management Control team has designed a control panel that supervises the various areas of the company, such as sales planning, logistics, marketing, payroll and personnel administration, and cost centre managers.The planning method used in the sales area is a good example of how Board makes Boiron\u2019s decision-making process flexible, in full collaboration with the Management Control managers:Let\u2019s look, for example, at a forecast generated by the sales department based on turnover for a given point in the year. Individual items still lie at the root of the process, but the Sales Managers can modify their groupings to meet business review needs, with the support of drill-down capabilities that reach the most granular detail,\u201d explains Deiana. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the Sales Managers can use Board\u2019s \u201csplit & splat\u201d function to reallocate forecasts on all \u201cleaf\u201d elements, by means of drivers that consider historic sales data. With Board, this type of grouping and feature can also be applied to customers, thus creating variable clusters of customers. In this respect, the benefits of Board include the automation of calculations, for example. driver-based reallocation is done automatically.As for drill-down capabilities, Boiron\u2019s CIO points out that Board is capable of high granularity, reaching right down to, for example, an individual line of a customer order or supplier order, or an individual line of an invoice, or an individual warehouse transaction, or an individual accounting record. According to Levasseur,It\u2019s up to the user to decide what level of detail they want to go down to, but with Board it\u2019s possible to combine this with a broader vision, with aggregated views or maximally granular analyses.Board\u2019s flexibility at Boiron Italia can also been seen in reporting processes. Going back to the sales area again, Board receives real-time information from the marketing departments that deal with product launches or pricing changes. This information is then also sent to the sales area so that everyone can operate in a single work environment. The logistics area, in turn, checks the stocks of the various products, generates purchasing forecasts for future months, and applies any logistical constraints to the stocks. This information is also shared with the sales department, and \u2013 thanks to Board\u2019s unified planning and reporting environment \u2013 evidence of this information appears in the sales area reports in the form of alerts to check the availability of certain products.We\u2019ve used the Board platform to create a dedicated reporting process for the sales area, which goes beyond the forecast area and is updated every day on the basis of sales orders, in real time, thus showing us the actual situation compared to the daily plan, and enabling us to enter other data, such as pharmacy sell-out data, Deiana confirms.Planning with the fullest possible knowledgeBoard has also been used to create a panel for each cost centre manager, which is automatically fed with definitive accounting data for a given month. This application has turned out to be very useful for cost centre managers at Boiron Italia because a whole series of important information for the company\u2019s decision-making process is pre-entered in the months that follow the one being scrutinized. For example, using the Group\u2019s business management application, we enter all the Direct Purchase Orders (DPOs) expected for future months. So, using the Board application for cost centres, each manager has constant sight of a cost that they have already committed for future months, and therefore has a clear idea of whether or not their planning is \u201cspacious\u201d enough to be confirmed,\u201d explains Deiana.It is worth noting that cost centre managers not only have sight of purely accounting-related data but can also view details, including non-financial operational data, such as information about DPOs. This data is drillable into cost accounting to identify the destination of certain costs within an account. Board also provides the benefits of visibility and full awareness by means of a dedicated workflow management panel for Management Control, where the platform acts as a \u201ccontrol tower\u201d for the various planning setups in use at any \u00a0given time of the year, while also providing evidence of data start-up dates, sales data, accounting data, and warehouse data.Thanks to Board, we have a clear picture at all times of which planning processes are in progress and what information has been loaded, for each planning phase: start-up, parametric and setting, sales, marketing, logistics, and the cost accounting phase, in other words the phase that involves all the cost centres,\u201d explains Deiana. \u201cFrom this panel created on Board, it is easy for us to open and close the planning process for a particular department within the group; uploads between one area module and another are automatic, and we can keep track of changes made at a given moment by an individual user or individual departments.Once the accounting phase has been closed, the Management Control team uses Board to send semi-automatic feedback to all cost centre managers in the form of intuitive, easy-to-use reports tailored to the profile of the user. In turn, each cost centre manager can send Management Control a statement of their actual situation compared with their planned situation and highlight any deviations. This means that both the cost centre managers and Management Control team are fully and immediately aware of any deviations, so that contact can be made with the various stakeholders in the decision-making process.Now we can request feedback immediately and receive comments on these deviations, so as to get as clear an idea as possible of their type and extent, and start devising corrective action,\u201d says Deiana. \u201cI would also like to stress that our income statement is \u201clive\u201d, so to speak: as soon as the planning is done \u00a0we can see the results and how they change in our income statement. This means we can respond during the planning process to implement any corrective action.Before the company started using Board, it used to take about a month to close this whole process. \u00a0Now, Boiron manages to carry out end-to-end planning between all its departments and close a full monthly forecast within just a few days.When we say \u2018full forecast\u2019 we mean a forecast that takes account of each business area and all the services, i.e.: accounting, production, logistics, cost centres and finance,\u00a0explains Deiana.\u00a0 In the case of logistics, we also use Board to launch procurement planning and production requests. By the end of the second working day, we close our turnover and balance the values between our sales, warehouse, and accounting transactions. On the fourth day, we close our costs in accounting (including for statements to the group\u2019s central management and reports for the markets) and also receive feedback on any deviations between the actual situation and planned situation. Under this timetable, by the end of the eighth working day of the month, we manage not only to close the planning process and generate a full monthly forecast but also give General Management a clear picture of any deviations and what we think should be done about them.Managing unforeseen circumstances and emergenciesBy using Board during an unexpected event of huge worldwide impact, like the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the Boiron Group saw further confirmation of the Intelligent Planning Platform\u2019s capabilities. In fact, just before the outbreak of the emergency, Boiron had already consolidated the processes of reporting, planning, budgeting, and forecasting, and promoted a set of best practices for use of the software throughout the organization. As a result, the fact that the pandemic revolutionized every priority and activity planned up to that moment did not interrupt the logic of the processes, or interrupt business continuity, or even make it necessary to add new features or applications to deal with the situation. As Deiana explains:Our planning on Board already had all the necessary features and flexibility to deal with changing market needs. The pandemic certainly had a major effect on the OTC pharmaceutical market, in which we operate. For example, we had totally unexpected peaks in demand and a high degree of volatility with regard to individual items. As a result, we had to review all our production planning with the Group, and we had to re-plan all our promotional activities, re-allocate resources and review our profitability. But the Management Control team, the general management and all the department managers agree that the planning process built on the Board platform already had all the flexibility and automation that we needed to manage the changes, even the most unexpected ones. We didn\u2019t have to change anything substantial in our planning process or change the nature of our business logic.In fact, Boiron was able to concentrate on individual items and certain clusters of customers during the emergency by taking full advantage of Board\u2019s flexibility and the aspects of the platform that best met these needs, while also monitoring business performance against existing plans.\u201cWe managed to re-plan all our production and distribution and all our activities in an incredibly short time. Board has given us speed and flexibility, while ensuring consistency and integration between all departments,\u201d confirms Deiana.During the global pandemic, Board proved to be useful for enabling individuals and departments to work remotely, which almost all staff had to start doing.Platforms like Board have proved to be really useful in this respect, because they\u2019re designed and developed with a technology that enables remote working, even in highly complex situations, where people have been separated from their habitual \u201cphysical\u201d place of work, - said Levasseur."

        "company": "Slowear",
        "content": "Slowear is a family business concept and an Italian lifestyle project stemming from a long industrial history, combining four historic Italian fashion brands that share a high level of specialization: Incotex (high-level quality trousers since 1951); Zanone (minimalist knitwear); Glanshirt (the vintage shirt); and Montedoro (State-Of-The-Art-Outerwear).Slowear was built on this heritage of know-how and product-centric passion and promotes a \u2018durable\u2019 fashion concept, featuring inner and outer qualities that make it immune to the passing of time and fleeting trends. This philosophy caters to a need that is becoming increasingly urgent in the fashion industry: spreading a more ethical and sustainable consumption model.With 29 stores in the world\u2019s main shopping capitals including Milan, London, Paris, New York City, Tokyo, and Seoul, and in key international department stores (such as la Rinascente in Milan), Slowear Venezia is recognized by buyers and connoisseurs as one of the leading Italian multi-brand menswear concepts. Slowear has a unique value proposition, presenting a range of brands, accessories, and homeware/lifestyle products. All stores feature a modern and sophisticated layout whose heart is the lounge area, which is devoted to conviviality and total immersion into the Slowear lifestyle.Project OverviewImplemented solutions: Strategic Planning; Merchandise Planning; Seasonal Budgeting; Assortment Planning and Buying; Retail Planning; In-Season ManagementTiming: Yearly and seasonalUser types: Retail and merchandise manager, senior controllers, supply chain managersFull Retail Planning with the Board Intelligent Planning PlatformSlowear needed to adopt a comprehensive approach to link all of its planning steps, from the Strategic Plan to the daily replenishment in-store. Luca Berga, Merchandise Director at Slowear, explains:\"Board was already present within our company and our people were familiar with the software. We already used Board to manage some parts of the retail planning process and had experienced the great flexibility and simplicity of the platform. That\u2019s why we decided to rely on Board \u2013 supported by consultancy partner PwC \u2013 to implement a full retail planning process. It proved to be the best solution for our needs.\"Conceived to support and accelerate the growth of Slowear, the project framework was ambitious but was delivered successfully thanks to Board\u2019s technological capabilities combined with PwC\u2019s expertise:The graphic above was presented by PwC and Slowear at Boardville 2019 \u2013 May 19-22\"Data & Analytics help businesses to grow, operate effectively, and unlock data possibilities,\" says Mirko Carolo, Manager D&A Technology at PwC. \"That means spending time and money more quickly and easily, shortening the distance between insights and value, analyzing the impact of future moves, and empowering people with in-depth data. At Slowear we have leveraged the power of the Board Intelligent Planning Platform to support data-driven Integrated Retail Planning, combined with actionable insights gained through Board, from strategy to operations.The definition and revision of the strategic plan is conducted in order to share the long-medium term guidelines used to develop new collections and to plan retail sales. These guidelines enable the management of the downstream plan, through the definition of measurable sales and margin targets, and provide additional information about the retail network which is used in the following step. The strategic plan is revised every six months and covers a two-year period.\"Slowear\u2019s strategic plan is defined by the senior management team, senior controllers, and merchandising & retail managers, and is fed by the following inputs:Strategic guidelinesNew product linesNew store openingsNew style guidelinesSales and delivered value in storesBased on historical data, the markup and sell-through per channel, event, brand, and product family are defined. The sell-through goal is used for margin calculation and the next season\u2019s budget. The end-of-season forecast is then defined based on current season sales, as Luca explains:\"With Board, we define the sales budget for the next season, involving dimensions such as geographic area, sales channel, brand, and gender. Consequently, planned seasonal sales are allocated by product type, product family, and event, based on historical data. Retail managers analyze the data in the strategic plan in order to verify sales and margin goals that have previously been defined.\"Based also on historical seasonal sales and the merchandise grid held by retail managers and controllers, the seasonal budget allows Slowear to produce sales forecasts and margins taking into account dimensions such as store, brand, product family, gender, and product type. The budget includes also information on store openings and closures. Budget data is imported from the strategic plan, where market sales are defined, and information about each store is added (e.g. promotions). For each store, the sell-out and sell-through rates are defined in order to obtain open-to-buy values for next season.The assortment process starts straight after the budgeting phase, which is the responsibility of the merchandise and retail managers and controllers. The goal of this step is to define the store assortment in order to be aligned with the sales and margin targets, taking into consideration store capacity and visual planning. Then, the Assortment Plan gives rise to the buying retail plan and the initial allocation per store and SKU.\"We have implemented, using Board, a Range Plan for each store which sets out the number of target SKUs, from which the average sales price, quantity, and depth (by store) are calculated. At a regional level the Assortment Plan defines with product will be available in the market for future seasons. Each buying session defines the product quantities that will be ordered per store. The order is then aggregated in clusters and sent to production. Initial allocation defines the product quantity that will be send to stores at the beginning of the season and also defines what will be available in the warehouse during the season in order to replenish stores,\" Luca continues.Gathering the retail and merchandising inputs on the Board environment relating to production, stock, seasonal sales per store, the Assortment Plan, and the target stock levels, Slowear\u2019s supply chain managers drive two linked processes: replenishment and reorder. These are the main phases of In-Season Management, a continuous process related to the seasonal sales period that aims to optimize, with a short-medium term view, store sales while keeping low stock levels, therefore reducing working capital and stock-out. The replenishment phase calculates sales potential per store during the season and plans the distribution of available stock, while the reorder phase deals with the special orders made by the stores.\"In-Season Management is based on the concept of Target Stock Level (TSL). When the quantity in the store is below the TSL, replenishment is suggested. It is also based on aggregated seasonal sales curves of previous seasons and a manual adjustment. Data is calculated daily and at a store SKU level. Board allows us to accurately define the replenishment order from warehouse to store and to get the right balance across different stores,\" Luca explains.Leveraging the high standards of Board\u2019s technology and architecture, and taking advantage of its unified environment for the entire planning process, the different phases of the full retail planning process at Slowear can be run concurrently by different people in different regions.\"That is very helpful, particularly when you need to switch from business-as-usual to management by exception across several markets and their relevant issues,\" says Luca.Meeting the needs of CFOs, Merchandise Managers, Supply Chain Managers, and Senior Controllers with a single product: the benefits of BoardAccording to Luca, Board has enabled Slowear to change and improve employees\u2019 approach to planning and analysis without 'frictional' effects:\"Board users have been involved in the creation of the applications they consequently use. Board has allowed us to realize an Integrated Retail Planning approach for the entire organization, including different job functions \u2013 such as retail and merchandise managers, supply chain managers, and controllers \u2013 across our stores around the world. The intuitiveness of the Board Intelligent Planning Platform helps to deliver a view of complex processes, simplifying them with an accurate workflow that covers every step from the strategic plan down to the single stores. Amongst the other benefits that Board has brought to Slowear, I would like to mention the increased efficiency in seasonal orders, the reduction of end of season stock, and the increased visibility and control of merchandise in our stores.\"The majority of the content and views discussed in this case study represent the information shared by Slowear and PwC during the Boardville event (2019 \u2013 May 19-22)"

        "title": "Budgeting, Planning, and Forecasting Transformation at KOS",
        "company": "KOS Group",
        "content": "Established in 2002, KOS has grown to become a leader in healthcare provision and Italy\u2019s number-one private nursing home operator. The company offers social health and residential care for chronic illnesses, rehabilitation and mental health services, advanced technology applied to medicine, and acute care medicine through three dedicated brands:Anni Azzurri, which is involved in the treatment and care of elderly patients through a multi-regional network of high-quality residential services\u00a0Santo Stefano, which is dedicated to functional rehabilitation for problems stemming from various diseases, including severe post-coma brain injuriesMedipass, which offers integrated, high-tech healthcare services including diagnosis and therapy, comprehensive management of technology parks, and outsourcing of outpatient diagnosisWith a turnover in excess of \u20ac595 million, KOS employs over 13,700 people in Italy, Germany, the UK, and India, who help to manage more than 12,800 beds across 193 facilities. These include 101 care homes, two hospitals, 25 outpatient centers, and 29 service outlets for technological solutions that innovate and optimize health systems.The Challenge: Disparate reporting processes and a lack of autonomy and flexibilityOperating from numerous production sites distributed throughout many different geographic areas, KOS is a business with a very fragmented structure. The company's growth is partly built on the acquisition of facilities that the management has had to integrate gradually into the group. Consequently, there is a need to ensure stringent control of all processes for each facility to maintain long-term compliance with the fundamental principles of the group: efficiency, quality, the fulfillment of customer needs, and ethical principles.Traditionally, each production site was tied to its own reporting and management commentary system. These were built on Excel spreadsheets, with individual logic, supported by databases and management software (ERP and HR solutions) that were not linked. To more effectively guide value creation inside and outside the group, and ensure the increasing quality of services, the management team needed to make decisions with greater awareness and speed, based on reliable, validated information supplied in a timely manner.Planning and management control had proven to play a key role in supporting the managers and directors in their strategic choices. As a result, there was a need to collect fragmented data from different sources within a single structured environment to deliver deeper insights and enable continuous benchmarking (both generally and for each production site) that would steer the group's decision-making processes towards growth and efficiency.The choice of the Board Intelligent Planning platform, which helps plan smarter in a self-service, code-free environment, was the logical solution to the KOS' business needs.\"In particular,\" says Giuseppe Motta, Director of Planning & Management Control, \"the two main characteristics that led\u00a0KOS to opt for Board were\u00a0the\u00a0autonomy that the software would offer us, especially regarding the planning and control department, together with the solution\u2019s\u00a0tremendous flexibility. In fact, with regard to autonomy, the planning and management control staff were able to define the reporting structures in detail, aligning them across the entire group. In particular, Board's flexibility has enabled\u00a0KOS\u00a0to\u00a0design tailored reports and workflows\u00a0based precisely on the ideas of the management and directors,\u00a0without needing to know specific programming languages.\"The Solution: An Intelligent Platform with a single set of logicIn a cooperative project delivered by Board Italia and partner Bios Management, the implementation of the Board platform began with the support of KOS' internal IT department. The project initially focused on balancing and aligning the methods of the various people involved to ensure their compliance with predefined objectives and in turn delivering quick wins for the business. The scalability of Board has enabled the solution to be extended easily over time, increasing the number of users from the initial 10 to over 130. Giuseppe explains:We started by evaluating the state of existing reporting activities. We then began to use Board in management and operational reports, gradually extending it to other reporting areas until it eventually covered all our reporting needs. We then moved on to building applications for\u00a0budgeting, planning, and forecasting, all on the same platform. Finally, we were able to leverage Board's vast potential in simulating different scenarios. The solution has supported KOS throughout a period of growth that is still ongoing, fundamentally improving the activities of the Planning & Control department, as well as other critical business areas. We started out with a very diverse, fragmented situation consisting of facilities that were distant from one another, both geographically and in terms of the logic they used. Board has made everything much more orderly because it has allowed us to carry out analysis, planning, and simulations within a single environment that has a single consistent logic. This lets us manage and compare data in the same way for the whole group. The weekly or monthly report that ends up on the Managing Director\u2019s desk is formulated with the same method as the report used by the director of each health facility or hospital.Collaborating with Board Italia and Bios Management has been fundamental to KOS' success, not only during the initial deployment but also in subsequent upgrade projects.\"The key factor for the success of the projects was predominantly the tailor-made development characteristic, in other words, the notion of tailored applications,\" highlights Giuseppe. \"I would definitely recommend Board to other companies and organizations. What\u2019s more, other organizations have visited us to closely understand our experience with\u00a0Board. If an organization has clear ideas about what it wants to do, where it\u2019s going, and in what time frame, then deploying it will certainly be a success.\"The Benefits: Full awareness and shared information assets\"Before using Board, we worked directly on various operating systems and then aligned the information using Access and Excel. This procedure and other limitations made it increasingly difficult for us to integrate newly acquired facilities. With\u00a0Board, however,\u00a0we were able to take the complete set of reports that we had already defined for the group and apply it to the new acquisitions,\" says Giuseppe.This means better accessibility of information, which is certified and structured in a consistent way, and the ability to share information assets with the relevant people, from the operational heads of the facilities, to departmental managers, and right up to the Managing Director.\"The deployment of Board has given all levels of the organization a better and more thorough knowledge of the market and the sectors in which we operate. The group\u2019s information assets have actually increased, becoming a valuable resource for everyone, including in terms of awareness of the business itself,\" Giuseppe continues.KOS currently has around\u00a0130 users working on Board, including around 50 in the areas of administration, finance, and control, and the remainder in various departments, including marketing and internal auditing. In addition, budgeting is not limited to economic aspects, but also encompasses property and financial elements too.\"It\u2019s an end-to-end budget that is also more versatile thanks to Board's complete integration with the Microsoft Office environment (especially Excel),\" adds Giuseppe. \"In addition to formulating reports based on homogeneous workflows, the use of Board at full capacity\u00a0has allowed us to benefit from increasingly\u00a0advanced analytics, multi-scenario simulations, and continuous cost benchmarking, giving us full control of both the big picture and each individual facility within the group.\"Another application of Board that has brought great benefits and improvements to KOS is the Balanced Scorecard, which combines data from different management systems such as budgetary data for economic and financial tasks and personnel management data from the human resources department.\"Being a group with a workforce in excess of 5,000 employees, it is vital for us to make decisions based on human resource KPIs. Thanks to\u00a0Board, we are equipped with a screen that includes various dashboards displaying around a dozen indicators, which are designed to monitor and guide the objectives of the individual directors and the operational units scattered throughout the territory,\" says Giuseppe.By generating benefits within the group, Board has created added value for customers and partners of KOS. It provides reliable, validated data in a timely manner, allowing the management team to make informed decisions that improve the quality and standard of services provided.\"Thanks to Board, we have, for example, introduced benchmarks to constantly measure and compare a number of processes in our various rehabilitation centers and nursing homes, in order to derive a summary of best practices and disseminate them to all of the group\u2019s facilities,\" concludes Giuseppe."

        "company": "Sogegross",
        "content": "The Sogegross Group is among Italy's top ten private groups in the large-scale retail sector. Headquartered in Genoa, it is active in most Central and Northern Italian regions. The group's presence focuses chiefly on the brands:Sogegross and Grosmarket (cash & carry channel)Basko (supermarkets and superstores) and its e-commerce channel www.laspesabasko.itEkom (food discount)DORO supermarkets (supermarkets and superette franchises)Primia and Q Maiuscola (two private label brands within the group).The challenge: Supporting a complex supply chainOne of Sogegross\u2019 strengths is managing its distribution and logistics chain to serve the other brands in the group. They have seven platforms dedicated to specific types of products:fresh foodfruit and vegetablesfishmeatdry and fresh discountersfood (packaged)frozen.Combined, they see more than 65,000 tons of fresh products and more than 33,000,000 boxes of packaged products move through the chain every year. Discussing this, Marco Staiti, ICT Manager for Sogegross, recalls:\u201cWe were aware that, in addition to offering classic services such as the supply of solutions that target specific needs, very few software vendors could also provide more advanced services. These include\u00a0ad hoc dashboards and relevant alerts, based on in-depth analysis designed to prevent critical issues and incompatibilities.\u201dThe project: Extending intelligence to drive better outcomesSogegross widely uses the Board Intelligent Planning Platform across its key business functions and processes. These include:Financial Planning & Analysis:financial budgeting and forecastingmanagement controlanalysis of variances against the budget for cash & carryannual budget with quarterly revisionsreportingAnti-fraud measurementcashed-in vs. deposited daily monitoringcash-barrier data controlPurchasinganalysis of suppliers' and buyers\u2019 performances by area, department, product, and categoryproduct returns monitoringSales and marketinganalysis of sales for cash & carrysupermarket sales dashboardingmarketing intelligence (effect of promotions on sales and margins)management of all aspects of the cash & carry's marketing departmentLogisticsrolling forecast for logistics and cash & carryinventory reconciliationsmanagement of the distribution centers in terms of inventory movementstransportation monitoring (e.g., vehicle saturation and back-order packages) and impact of transport on revenueHuman Resourcesworkforce analysis (worked hours, workable hours, absenteeism, etc.)performance managementIT services\u00a0weekly monitoring of ERP hard disks\u2019 capacitiesThe benefits: Empowering IT and the business with an Intelligent Planning PlatformSogegross can now match business users' needs, coming from different job functions, with the related IT requirements across the entire supply chain and finance\u00a0and translate them into core shared objectives: Marco Staiti adds:\u201cBoard is an ideal tool that addresses specific business issues through ad hoc reports while allowing access to a single database under standardized control. This approach\u00a0draws on the specific skills of everyone and results in overall improvement and job satisfaction.\u201dKey benefits from the project include:IT resource optimizationEach week, Sogegross can quickly\u00a0verify peaks of HW/Services\u00a0so the IT Department can adjust the ERP\u2019s functioning based on the\u00a0best distribution of disk space\u00a0across the company.Reporting accelerationSogegross has also improved the efficiency of reporting creation. For example, generating a monthly report for the purchasing department previously required two working days. Now\u00a0Sogegross creates a\u00a0daily report in four seconds flat. Additionally, the time required to produce\u00a0weekly sales reports\u00a0for management has\u00a0fallen from hours to just one immediate click. Summarizing these vital enhancements at Sogegross, Marco Staiti concludes:\u201cOnce fully implemented in our organization, Board has demonstrated a surprising ability to\u00a0generate effective solutions within extremely short time frames. After experiencing this value of the Intelligent Planning Platform, we have been further impressed by the ease we can integrate Board into other software systems. For example,\u00a0Board is now fully integrated with our retail merchandising system.\u201dCost reductionThe cost of developing detailed reports has reduced by 30-35%, thanks to Board\u2019s self-service approach.Availability of the supplierSogegross also praised the ungrudging willingness of Board\u2019s expert teams to help them:\u201cWhen the need arise, we receive prompt answers not only from the support team but also directly from professional services team\u201d.\u00a0"

        "content": "Based in northeast Italy, Pixartprinting is the European leader in customized online printing services, including magazines, catalogs, labels, packaging, and textiles. 1,200 passionate and talented people handling up to 15,000 print jobs a day make its online presence possible. The company offers a complete, professional service that aims to support its customers\u2019 communication projects.The challenge: Shifting from siloed spreadsheets to a more collaborative approach\u00a0Pixartprinting used to handle strategic planning, budgeting, and forecasting processes in Excel, but they began to search for an innovative planning solution to tackle new competitive market challenges. In particular, the Company was experiencing a simultaneous change in the ERP system in some of its branches: it was the right moment to replace an FP&A spreadsheet-based approach with a more advanced solution. Federica Da Deppo, Head of FP&A, explains:We were struggling with a lack of collaboration across our departments due to a data-silos approach and information redundancy. That turned out into difficulty in driving our planning, forecasting, and business modeling processes.Pixartprinting was searching for a new tool to provide a wider picture of the company\u2019s information while ensuring fast responses when querying their databases. The new solution also had to make scenario simulation easier and more intuitive to improve their decision-making processes and to automatize relevant planning and analytics processes.The project: Integrating Intelligent Planning into the enterpriseThe key dimension of the Board Intelligent Planning Platform\u2019s implementation in Pixartprinting covers three main areas:closing managementfinancial planning with integrated business planning (IBP) methodologysales performance management\u00a0(SPM).Using the same Board database architecture and planning platform, Pixartprinting has also built a\u00a0capacity plan for the print machines, which feeds into the\u00a0HR planning process. With Board's flexibility and the extensive range of capabilities in the Intelligent Planning Platform, Pixartprinting has also defined an S&OP process across the organization. Below is a brief summary of each key pillar of the project:Closing managementLocal closuresMonthly consolidation (P&L)Reporting automation: P&L vs. budgets and previous year; KPI analysis (orders, deliveries, profitability in terms of \u20ac per sqm, etc.)Integrated business planning\u00a0P&L planning (revenue/OpEx)Net working capital p[lanningCapEx planningProfitability analysisExtended planning and analysis (xP&A) to HR, marketing, and IT departmentsGeneral & administrative expense planningFinancial forecasting, based on the daily allocation of monthly orders, according to historical seriesSales performance managementAutomatic monthly sales budgeting (by product family, product item, country) based on: (i) historical data; (ii) strategic planDaily sales forecasting (by product family, product item, country)Sales analyticsSales profitabilityCapacity planningAutomatic set by production linePrint machine\u2019s parameters management, such as rated capacity, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) indicators, shifts, and non-usageCapacity overview by machining center (budget sqm vs. work center capacity)Full Time Equivalent (FTE) \u00a0by machining center (this information also works as input for the HR plan)The benefits of Intelligent PlanningUsing the Board Intelligent Planning Platform, Pixartprinting has streamlined its planning, forecasting, and scenario management, giving shape to end-to-end planning across the company's key departments. Among the benefits seen, Pixartprinting has highlighted:Standardization of the planning environment: Board's unified architecture and database gather all relevant information from different departments and different planning cycles.Higher speed of reaction: Reporting automation enables the fast generation of actionable insights from information.Unified financial and non-financial planning: The Intelligent Planning Platform creates budgets and forecasts for finance, sales & marketing, production, and HR.Reduction of non-value-added activities: Automation across critical analysis and reporting processes provides the FP&A team with improved data analysis and valuable what-if analysis. Board\u2019s versioning capabilities models different scenarios for strategic planning, financial budgeting, and S&Op forecasting.\u00a0Faster HR planning: A significant enhancement gained through the IBP approach.Federica Da Deppo concludes:Our planning and forecasting processes have been channelled into stable, orderly structures, overcoming the uncertainties caused by Excel and\u00a0enhancing cooperation between departments. Board has especially led to greater and better interaction between sales and production, guaranteeing the consistency, timeliness, and usability of the data: an essential support for decision-making."

        "content": "StarKist is an established food company in the United States focused on providing healthy, sustainable, shelf-stable seafood and chicken products. It has three production facilities in American Samoa, Ecuador, and Senegal, and five major distribution centers in the US, in partnership with CJ Logistics. Considered an industry innovator, StarKist was the first brand to introduce single-serve pouch products, which include Tuna Creations\u00ae, Salmon Creations\u00ae, and Chicken Creations\u00ae.\u00a0The challenge: Keeping track of numbers, accounts, and SKUs derailed planning, analysis, and outcomesBefore StarKist began its transformation journey, all demand and production planning was entered and managed with manual spreadsheets. Aggregating and allocating units was error-prone and cumbersome, and numbers weren\u2019t available anywhere close to real-time between the supply planning and demand planning functions.\u00a0Other challenges included:Financial forecasting spreadsheets took days to complete and were often fraught with errors caused by dealing with new SKUs, discontinued SKUs, and customer allocations.Significant analysis of SKU traffic, such as digging deeper into the forecasts to determine delivery differences, was unachievable.\u00a0Supply chain\u2019s reliance on an SAP ERP for production planning resulted in a huge amount of data accumulating in a complex spreadsheet that was becoming too difficult to maintain.The Solution: Board Intelligent PlanningStarKist selected Board to deliver an intelligent supply chain planning solution that would seamlessly link supply planning and demand planning with finance. According to Ted Wong, Senior Manager of Demand Planning and Financial Analysis at StarKist, one of the key reasons for choosing Board was that \u201cit is configurable beyond measure and ultra-customizable to one\u2019s business needs.\u201dKey requirements of the transformational project included:A complete replacement of the spreadsheet-based planning system with Board\u2019s cloud-based Intelligent Planning Platform to perform all aggregations & allocations and automate the heavy lifting of manual data entry.Migration of supply chain operations onto the same Board solution, providing access to the same data as demand planning for a single point of truth across the two functions.The ability to build reports, such as forecast accuracy, and create scorecards and KPIs that include all financial variables.The capability to analyze, in detail, the pros and cons of new SKUs and what happened with discontinued SKUs.\u00a0StarKist praised Board\u2019s Professional Services team for delivering the initial solution in only six months; \u201cthey did a great job,\u201d commented Ted. \u00a0\u00a0The Benefits: Increased agility and greater collaborationThe Board-based supply and demand planning solution has empowered StarKist to:\u00a0Plan for and respond to disruption faster: Planning time has been reduced from 16 hours to less than one, increasing the agility and adaptability of the organization. \u00a0Increase transparency and collaboration: Moving from Excel spreadsheets to one shared Board solution has streamlined data flows and created a single, consolidated view of StarKist\u2019s data. \u00a0Boost the efficiency and security of operations: Aggregations and forecasting processes are now automated in one secure, cloud-based platform.Seamlessly integrate supply chain management: Board's supply and demand solution works seamlessly with the broader supply chain planning process.Make reliable decisions: The combination of Intelligent Planning with consistent forecast accuracy reports enables project variables to be used to effectively define benchmarks and goals.Take ownership of reports: The flexibility and the scalability of Board, combined with its no-code nature, has empowered StarKist\u2019s internal stakeholders to become experts in utilizing data and allows them to customize the reports and dashboards to suit evolving requirements.As a result of the benefits achieved to date, StarKist has further Board enhancements in mind. Next steps include the introduction of predictive analytics, additional financial metrics, and a promotional evaluation module."

        "company": "Ability Options",
        "content": "Established in 1976, Ability Options is a disability support services provider covering the east coast of New South Wales, Australia.The organization\u2019s 1,100 staff provide several types of assistance to clients, from in-home support to community health, education, and disability employment. Each year, more than 3,000 individuals benefit from increased opportunities thanks to the Ability Options team. \u00a0\u00a0The Challenge: An inefficient spreadsheet-based budgeting process\u00a0As demand for its services grew, Ability Options\u2019 administrative support functions faced increasing pressure. Staff were grappling with time-consuming financial processes that could no longer cope with demand and management realized that changes were needed.\u00a0\u201cFor an organization of our size, we really didn\u2019t have a very smart system for budgeting,\u201d says Manish Sharma, Group Financial Controller.\u00a0The finance team relied on a series of inefficient Excel spreadsheets that were difficult to manage and keep up to date. Compiling budgets by hand was extremely time-consuming, meaning it could take more than a week to manually pull budgeting information together for the senior leadership team. The process also lacked the ability to support effective short, medium, and long-term planning and assess the impact of business drivers on the bottom line.\u00a0\u201cWe had very limited ability to compare our actual results with our budgets, and there were constant issues around version control of the spreadsheets. When we had more than 100 cost centres and were approaching $100 million in turnover, it was clear that things had to change,\u201d explains Manish.\u00a0The Solution: A self-service approach to budgeting, planning, and forecasting\u00a0The Ability Options team set about searching for an alternative solution that would transform the budgeting process. After reviewing a range of potential solutions, the decision was taken in November 2018 to deploy the Board Intelligent Planning platform, which helps plan smarter in a single interface. Board was able to readily integrate with Ability Options\u2019 other core applications, which would make data sharing much easier and remove several tedious manual processes.\u00a0\u201cOne of our key selection criteria was having a solution that could be used by accountants who are not IT experts. We wanted finance staff to be able to configure and operate the platform unaided. We could see that Board clearly offered this capability,\u201d says Manish.\u00a0Board was also prepared to come and demonstrate the solution\u2019s capabilities in our own environment. They didn\u2019t just rely on a standard demonstration but related it to our particular requirements, which stood out during the selection process.\"Board was implemented by technology partner Mecklemore in just four months and went live in March 2019. Manish says Mecklemore\u2019s knowledge and experience was invaluable during the deployment process. The firm worked closely with the Ability Options management team to ensure the solution was tailored to meet the organization\u2019s specific needs, which was made easier thanks to Board\u2019s flexible platform approach. \u00a0The Benefits: From Excel to Driver-Based Budgeting \u00a0\u00a0With Board in place, Ability Options has significantly streamlined its budgeting process and the management team now has a real-time view of how actuals relate to forecasts.\u00a0\u201cOur budgeting process is now much simpler. Board has allowed us to move to driver-based budgeting and away from a situation where end users entered revenue or expense numbers into the P&L. Now, users input drivers and the software takes care of the calculations,\u201d explains Manish.\u00a0Thanks to the reduction in manual activities, savings equal to the annual workload of one employee have been made.\u00a0By integrating with the organization\u2019s accounting system and payroll application, Board has increased transparency across other finance processes and is used for month-end reporting. As information is now automatically pulled together from different systems, the manual effort associated with collating the data has been removed, the accuracy of reports is ensured, and security has been enhanced as there is no longer a need to share spreadsheets via email.\u00a0\u201cPreviously we had to manually send out Excel files, but now people can simply review the reports in Board. It\u2019s a real advantage to have a single source of the truth across the organization,\u201d comments Manish.\u00a0The Future: Expansion of Board to further reporting and forecasting\u00a0Looking ahead, Mark Twomey, Chief Corporate Services Officer, says the organization wants to make more use of Board beyond the budgeting function, and access will be provided to a larger number of staff so they can take advantage of its functionality. \u00a0Because the Board platform is highly flexible, it can be extended and customized to meet the changing requirements of the organization. \u00a0\u201cI think Board is a really good product because you can mould it into whatever you want it to be. It has an almost unlimited potential in many ways to give organizations whatever they might need for their budgeting, planning, and analysis,\u201d says Manish.\u00a0Moving forward, there are plans to use Board for activities such as KPI monitoring and reporting, bringing data into interactive dashboards for greater visibility. The company is also currently going through a major project to replace its legacy CRM system with Salesforce, which will be linked to Board to provide an extra dimension to the data.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s all about evolving and fine tuning what we have in place. We are constantly looking for ways to make our processes even better using Board. It has virtually unlimited potential for us. I\u2019m looking forward to how it will meet our needs as we continue to evolve and assist growing numbers of clients,\u201d concludes Mark. \u00a0"

From multiple General Ledger (GL) systems to detailed financial and sales reports coming from various dimensions across the business, the consolidation process was lengthy and inefficient.OTC turned to CFO Solutions as their EPM advisor and delivery services. After reviewing OTC\u2019s internal business and financial objectives, CFO Solutions identified the Board Intelligent Platform as having the necessary capabilities to automate and consolidate its financial reporting and they provided strategic direction on streamlining OTC processes throughout the implementation.Beginning their journey with Board Financial Consolidation (BFC), OTC achieved one consolidation point for the 30+ business units. This single framework is fundamental for efficient close and consolidation processes. This has enabled corporate accounting instant access to summary and transactional financial data. Board\u2019s self-service interface allows the finance team to easily perform essential analysis over consolidated financial results carried out in preparation for the financial statements. The team is empowered and equipped to provide financial statements and reporting at the individual business unit level, providing data insights and real-time value to internal stakeholders.\u00a0OTC continues to expand its use cases and strategic visions with Board by implementing cross-functional, company-wide planning. Once they completed their implementation of BFC, they quickly moved on to creating a reporting hub and financial forecasting module. OTC is now starting Phase II of its plan, which prioritizes operational and sales (transactional) reporting. Partnering with Board ensures that their reporting capabilities and future is limitless. Together OTC and Board are working to provide internal and external stakeholders a 360-degree view of the OTC business landscape by utilizing multiple data streams with the support of Board\u2019s vast capabilities.\u00a0"

        "content": "Avaloq is the Swiss market leader in back-office IT solutions for the private banking and wealth management sector. The business also offers ITO services to insurance companies and other financial institutions. Combined, Avaloq's clients have over 7,500 employees worldwide, using its systems and services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.The company's figures document an impressive daily workload: 3,000,000 technical transactions (the equivalent of 1,000,000 business transactions) managed through 350 Unix servers, 900 Intel servers, 2,500 MIPS mainframe, four\u00a0AS/400 servers, more than 100 Terabytes of storage, two international wide area networks, 50 local area networks, three\u00a0metropolitan area networks, 1,200 network components, 30 DMZ, five\u00a0neutral zones, 12,000 network access ports, 35 firewalls, 120 routers, and 350 switches.The Challenge: Overcoming the limitations of ExcelHaving become reliant on spreadsheets for financial analysis and reporting, Avaloq realized that this approach was unsustainable as the business continued to grow. Luca Mainini, Head of Finance at Avaloq, explains why the company began the search for a more comprehensive solution:\"Excel could no longer guarantee our ability to report on and analyze the data obtained from SAP, so we felt the need for a tool that would allow us to interact quickly with all of our data in an intelligent manner, and administer the growing volume of information generated by our business\".The company began to explore the available solutions on the market and came across the Board decision-making platform, which helps plan smarter, in a flexible, self-service interface. Marco Lusa, Senior Manager, continues:\"At the selection stage, the principal alternative considered was SAP BW, but the implementation costs and a certain rigidity detected at the prototyping stage suggested that we should go for a more flexible solution. A tool that did not require heavy investment or long lead-times before producing the operational information we needed: this is why we chose Board.\"The Project: Reporting, management control, and profitability analysisThe customizable nature of the Board platform enabled Avaloq to develop several tailored applications to suit the needs of different business areas. Luca explains the different stages of the Board project:\"Starting with a data structure inherited from SAP and managed in a DWH SQL, Board is used to generate a multidimensional view of profitability considering three principal dimensions: customer, service, and organization (BU). In addition, Board has allowed us to add levels of detail not managed by SAP and to reallocate costs and revenues from profit centers to projects, or divisions to departments, using a series of predefined drivers.\u00a0A second project involves the invoicing of back-office services. Commencing from a transaction-based system, we use Board to monitor and measure a series of quantities, such as the number of calls, the number of payments handled, and the number of pages printed, that enable us to price the services provided and invoice the customer accordingly.\"The range of solutions developed using the Board platform also includes an application that allows Avaloq to automatically consolidate the operating results of all group companies.\"The breadth of the information managed using these applications lays solid foundations for our reporting processes which, thanks to Board, benefit from a modern, easy to use, and highly interactive interface,\" says Luca.The Benefits: Simulations, ease of use, and ongoing enhancementsAndrea Bionda, Senior Solutions Architect, outlines the benefits of using Board for analysis and reporting:\"From an IT standpoint this choice assured us of many important advantages: in fact, the adoption of Board has enabled us to overcome the limitations of Excel in terms of volume, security, the centralization of data, and the ability to simulate and report. At the same time, we found the tool easy to install and configure, allowing the multidimensional database to be managed in a totally intuitive manner.\"Board has also enabled Avaloq to go further than just examining historical data, as Marco continues:\u00a0\"In my view, the value added by Board is our new ability to run simulations: we have moved from viewing data as-is to a more advanced scenario, where we can analyze the impact of likely future events. For example, in our next implementation of the budgeting process, we want to take a dynamic rather than static approach to the available data. Simply by changing certain parameters, we should be able to make projections and forecasts to year end that build on the partial data available for the period. Clearly, to achieve this, we will need an in-depth knowledge of the tool in order to benefit in full from the opportunities it makes available.\"Keeping up with ongoing development to the Board platform, Avaloq has upgraded as and when new versions are released, bringing further benefits to the company:\"In terms of our daily work, the upgrade to new versions of Board has brought enormous benefits. Administration is now much easier at the installation and configuration stage and, more importantly, when it comes to the various data management activities required: from backups to the construction and maintenance of databases, each operation has become easier and more effective,\" says Andrea.Luca concludes by summarizing what he sees to be the biggest advantage of Board:\u00a0\"From my standpoint, as an advanced end user, the greatest advantage offered by Board is undoubtedly its practicality. The front-end has an innovative graphical\u00a0interface that combines ease of use with a powerful ability to display, analyze, and interact with data.\""

        "content": "Since its founding more than 80 years ago, Harry & David has grown to become America\u2019s premier choice for gourmet gifts. From handpicked fresh fruit to hand-packed gift baskets filled with delicious treats, the company is committed to providing premium quality and excellence in every way. With a history rich in agriculture and family values, the Harry & David story started with Samuel Rosenberg, a successful hotel owner in Seattle, Washington, who in 1910 traded his prized Hotel Sorrento for 240 prime acres of pears in Southern Oregon\u2019s Rogue River Valley. The Orchards were later taken over by his two sons, Harry and David Rosenberg, who launched their eponymous mail-order (now web-order) gift basket business in 1934.The Challenge: Over-reliance on time-consuming, spreadsheet-based finance processesDuring the digitization of operations over a 30-year period, the Harry & David finance team had grown its financial accounting and reporting largely on Excel. It became apparent that a tremendous amount of time was dedicated to rationalizing and consolidating multiple spreadsheets from across the company into a suitable format for end of quarter and end of year consolidation and reporting. Naturally, the company was keen to replace this manually-intensive process with a more automated approach. The finance team had also recently transitioned to a new general ledger system that did not offer the reporting capabilities that the team required, creating the need to evaluate other financial reporting systems.On top of analysis and reporting requirements, the business sought a means of streamlining forecasting for its separate departments to drive efficiency in the process.\u00a0After an extensive search of available software solutions, Harry & David selected the Board Intelligent Planning Platform to meet its combined reporting and forecasting needs.\u00a0\"The implementation process for users is straightforward,\" explains Adam August, VP of Finance. \"There was a week-long session where we worked with a training partner to review Board in detail regarding how to set up the databases, how the data relationships work, and so forth. After the initial training, we found it to be easy hands-on with learning, particularly for the core, day-to-day user who is not directly maintaining the databases or the data relationships.\"\u00a0The Benefits: Significant time savings, greater business insights, and increased accuracy of reports and forecastsHarry & David's finance department loaded the general ledger data into the unified database of the Board platform to create a single point of truth.\u00a0Using Board to interrogate this data, the team is now able to easily compile end-of-month reports with variances, as well as project forecasts.\u00a0Users can quickly drill down into headcount information\u00a0for a\u00a0more holistic view\u00a0of the company\u2019s operations, including what is performing well and what may need adjustments.Additional data sources open up more opportunities to examine data. For example, by linking into the company's payroll system users are able to track vacancy rates and plan merit increases.Bringing reporting and forecasting together using Board also enabled Harry & David to change and significantly expand its processes. The company has become more flexible and dynamic in discussions around financial performance and potential future plans. Forecast cycles that previously took up to one and a half weeks are now accomplished in two days or less, with less redundancy and a higher degree of accuracy.The self-service nature of Board, delivered through its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, empowers departmental managers and senior executives to understand their business drivers as well as what\u2019s occurring within their market and specific departments. Instead of having to build new reports to answer executive questions, Harry & David's managers are now able to call up an existing report with ease and drill down to the granular details that answer their specific query.Seeing opportunities for improvement outside of the finance department, Harry & David has also rolled out applications on the Board platform for Sales, Marketing, and Inventory Control, driving an increasingly unified approach and streamlining the business further.\u00a0"

        "title": "Optimized Reporting and Forecasting at RTL",
        "company": "RTL",
        "content": "RTL Nederland is a subsidiary of media giant RTL Group, one of the largest TV, radio, and production companies in Europe. The company operates numerous well-known TV channels and digital brands including RTL Nieuws, RTL XL, Buienradar, and Videoland, as well as investing in Dutch and international films.The Challenge: Disparate financial processes across a complex organizational structureWith such a wide range of activities taking place under the numerous RTL Nederland (RTL) brands, the broadcaster\u2019s finance department faced several challenges in producing a unified set of reports and forecasts, as Gerben de Birk, Senior Business Controller at RTL, explains:\u201cIn Finance, we have multiple legal entities to combine and consolidate to get through our reporting. But as the activities are also very different from each other \u2013 an online video platform is so different from a TV channel with different types of revenue and cost \u2013 it\u2019s very hard to have one standard P&L which can be used for all activities throughout the organization.\u201dThese various entities also have their own managers and board members, each requiring different levels of support and information from the finance team, as Gerben continues:\u201cWe have many stakeholders, both internal and external, as we are part of RTL Group in Luxembourg which is interested in our financial performance. Within the Netherlands we also have some matrix organizations, so sometimes it\u2019s not always a horizontal or vertical loop - it can be both ways. This makes it really complex if you work without an automated system.\u201dFinancial reporting was traditionally conducted using a complex manual process in Excel, which involved the downloading of data from the SAP ERP system, addition of information from subsidiaries and placement in a conversion table, data validation, creation of a pivot table, checking of the layout, pasting of reporting figures into a reporting file, and final reconciliation using SAP. Each reporting sheet became bigger as the company grew, making them extremely slow to open and reaching the limits of the company\u2019s hardware.\u201cFor external reporting especially, we were depending on an Excel file with almost 160 sheets, and most of the sheets were over 500 rows. Even the input sheet extended to a few thousand rows. You can imagine that this file was growing in size, containing a lot of formulas which made your computer work really hard just opening or recalculating everything in the file. It took us around 15-30 minutes just to get the report and the consolidated figure ready. Mistakes could be made if you were not looking really carefully at your data,\u201d says Gerben.There was a similar process in the Controlling department when creating P&Ls for each business unit, which would often create confusion when controllers or business managers moved to other areas of the organization:\u201cEach controller had their own way to download or extract the data, but everybody works in their own way. There was no standardized layout. And because you\u2019re working with Excel and the organization is constantly changing, it\u2019s hard to catch up if you need to re-do all your layouts, pivots, and formulas,\u201d continues Gerben.\u00a0Producing financial forecasts was also challenging, requiring business controllers to manually compute the forecast versus their budget, upload the data to an Excel template, and send it for consolidation.\u201cThe reporting department was receiving the Excel files, but we have several controllers who were each receiving multiple files. They needed to process them all into one master file which, again, required a lot of copying and pasting of data, with the risk that some bits and pieces were getting lost. When they had consolidated all the input, there was some manual analysis on the variations. You could work with some simple Excel formulas or pivot tables, but again, it was hard to get the right details when there had been big changes.\u201dThe Solution: Standardized reporting and forecasting in BoardIt was clear to RTL that a new, robust solution was required that would provide faster access to more detailed information and create reporting consistency across multiple teams and divisions. Working with Board Partner, Axians, the Board Intelligent Planning Platform was selected as the platform of choice to drive the change.\"The solution met our requirements and wishes, the price-quality ratio was good, and Axians' Smart Finance approach appealed to us. We actively involved our finance colleagues in the decision. They all saw the proof of concepts and together we took the decision. As a result, there is broad support for the solution,\" Gerben continues.To ensure the transformation to the new way of working went smoothly, RTL involved key stakeholders throughout the project. Gerben provides some key advice for those embarking on a similar journey:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s very important to reconcile with everybody in your business unit and your company. The change to a more automated system is designed to support everyone, so you will need the support of everyone. Definitely propose what you are planning to do and show what you are doing with your team. We showed them right from the first demo, and now everybody is happily using it.\u201dThe Benefits: Immediate access to data, increased insights, and greater flexibilityAutomatically bringing together data from multiple sources business-wide, Board became a Single Point of Truth for all analysis and reporting at RTL, transforming day-to-day activities for the finance team and delivering numerous improvements over the old way of working.Replacing Excel with a standardized approachAccess to accurate data in a fast, consistent manner is one of the key benefits RTL has realized through the use of Board, as Gerben explains:\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t use Excel for reporting anymore. Nowadays, we have all the reports available in the same system, using the same data source. The Reporting department and the Controlling department are using Board. All reports have a standardized layout, so everybody is immediately familiar with what they are looking at.\u201dThis standardization ensures everyone is always on the same page, with a unified view of what\u2019s happening in the business:\u201cThe biggest benefit is that the data is now readily available to everyone. We have a daily upload from SAP to Board, then Board makes the data immediately available and everybody can look at it. During the month-end close, or at other times when you need a swift overview of the latest data, we can trigger the upload process and it only takes a few moments before we can continue with our analysis.\u201dGreater business insight in a fraction of the time Multiple new views of the data can also now be accessed with ease, as Board offers the flexibility to examine it from different perspectives using interactive reports or dashboards. This includes bringing in non-financial data from other departments to link financial decisions with operational metrics:\u201cWe now have the possibility to make the dashboards directly available beside our P&L or financial figures. This saves time in handling data to make reports in the dashboards. We also have many more different overviews available. It\u2019s much easier to open up a specialized report for the matrix organization, or open another report just to show data per legal entity, or whatever we want. And of course, we can easily combine data from finance with other KPIs. We are still in an early phase of implementing Board, but we already have all the HR data of FTE and headcount available in Board as well, so now you can compare your personal expenses with the HR data,\u201d says Gerben.Board also delivers a greater level of insight into the underlying numbers, replacing error-prone manual processes with a more automated approach:\u00a0\u201cWe can now easily, within a report, drill down and see very quickly from which cost center and which account the variance is coming from. Analysis is now much quicker than before, where the reporting unit would have had to look through 160 Excel sheets. Because everything is ready in Board, you have less risk of errors. You don\u2019t have the manual work or the copy paste work where you can miss out, or where formulas can break. This is really helpful for ensuring we have secure data available.\u201dFaster, more flexible forecastingBoard has also transformed RTL\u2019s manual forecasting processes into a much more efficient activity, in which data is readily available straight after it has been entered, making the impact on the bottom line immediately visible to everyone. Board\u2019s split and splat functionality also makes it much easier to distribute data over multiple months, cost centers, or RTL accounts. Forecasts are produced monthly, enabling them to be compared with the actuals per month and helping to enhance decision-making throughout the year. Gerben elaborates:\u00a0\u201cWe also take the actuals from previous months into account, and that helps a lot because previously we only had the variance on the budget. For a contract which changes value, it\u2019s quite easy to give the new amount, but if we have some impacts from prior years or other one-offs, they\u2019re\u00a0now\u00a0taken into account too. We are now using, for the future months, the budget figures or the previous forecast figures, so even if you don\u2019t make any changes, there are still numbers in there.\u201d\u00a0In addition to comparing actuals versus budget, RTL is now also able to report the reforecast on a monthly basis with ease, as Board enables variance calculations to be produced with one click:\u00a0\u201cIt makes much more sense to do this throughout the year because it\u2019s the updated version of your goal. With one button in Board, we can just change the budget column into a forecast and the variances will be calculated automatically,\u201d says Gerben.Greater control, security, and accuracyThe entire forecasting process is controlled via a workflow in Board, making it easy to see the current status and know when each department or controller has completed their input. Access to data is also managed via user profiles, increasing overall security and the accuracy of the data.\u201cWe now have limited access within the departments, and controllers only have authorization to edit the departments they are responsible for. This saves someone else accidentally changing your figures or overriding some numbers you put in earlier. And of course we have less risk of errors because there\u2019s no copy and paste, or person in between transferring data,\u201d continues Gerben.Efficiency in action: Responding to COVID-19The benefits of Board\u2019s flexibility became even more evident during the Coronavirus pandemic. RTL experienced a temporary reduction in advertising revenue and its content producers were unable to continue filming due to the lockdown. Management teams and board members needed fast, up-to-date insight of the impact of the evolving situation on the company\u2019s finances, which the team was able to provide using Board. Gerben shares the story:\u00a0\u201cThey often asked us how the situation was developing, so we decided to implement a weekly forecast. With our old process it took multiple days just to consolidate the forecast so it would be hard to do on a weekly basis. With Board, we were able to have a weekly forecast where we started on Monday and by the end of the week everyone had entered their new numbers, and by the next Monday morning we could discuss the new figures which were available. They were also immediately available in a report which could be distributed too. If the old processes had still existed, I don\u2019t think we would have been able to do so, but with Board we were able to quickly consolidate the data, have the corporate analysis ready in time, and we used a weekly forecast version to have a good view of how things were developing.\u201dThe Future: Bringing in more external data to enhance driver-based forecastsGerben finishes by summarizing the end result of the Board project and discussing future plans:\u201cOverall, we have changed our way of working in the Controlling and Reporting departments from Excel to a tool, an automation, where we are able to work even better than before. The next steps will be to optimize some processes. From a reporting point of view we have some more wishes coming in, so we will extend the type of reports we have. The whole roadmap will be adjusted accordingly. We will introduce more non-financial data, not only the KPIs of HR, but we can also work with video subscribers and the subscription prices from our video platform. So maybe we can continue with more driver-based forecasting from there.\u201d"

        "title": "Board - Balancing Production Capacity & Demand at Biobest",
        "company": "Biobest",
        "content": "Biobest Group is a global leader in integrated pest management, biological control, and pollination. Providing a green alternative to pesticides, the company rears beneficial insects and mites used by farmers to protect their crops against diseases and sells bumblebees for pollination purposes.\u00a0Founded in 1987 and headquartered in Belgium, the company has 25 subsidiaries worldwide. Innovation and product quality are at the heart of Biobest\u2019s activities, and the company prides itself on providing tailored advice and technical support for farmers.\u00a0The Challenge: Effectively balancing production capacity and demandIn striving to achieve its mission of being the most reliable supplier of bumblebees and crop protection products, Biobest faced several challenges. Long production times of up to 16 weeks, fluctuating levels of demand, and variations in crop yields due to their biological nature created a complex balancing act between available production capacity and demand.\u00a0\u201cOur customers place their orders just a couple of days before receiving their goods, so the big question is, how much should we produce? We don\u2019t want to let our customers down, so high availability is key, but harvests that are too big will create waste and lead us to incur unnecessary costs. We want to avoid this to ensure our products remain affordable. As an environmentally friendly company, we want to protect our resources too,\u201d explains Luc Buntinx, Business Application Manager at Biobest.The Solution: A single platform for organization-wide planning and forecasting\u00a0As a solution to these challenges, the Biobest team chose to implement the Board Intelligent Planning Platform, which unifies business intelligence, planning, and predictive analytics capabilities in a flexible, highly customizable environment.\u201cBoard was to function as a communication platform to gather, transform, and exchange the necessary data with all our stakeholders in the global supply network,\u201d continues Luc. \u201cWe wanted to have the right information at the right time to make decisions and guarantee high delivery performance. Board is very powerful in calculating aggregations and breakdowns. You can, for example, perform data entry, and on-the-fly it will recalculate aggregations and breakdowns in a few seconds. During our evaluation process, we didn\u2019t see many tools that were capable of doing that. It was one of the key reasons we chose Board.\u201dBiobest sought to move away from treating each subsidiary as a separate business entity, using Board to create a holistic, integrated approach across the entire organization.\u00a0\u201cWe wanted a good view of total demand inside the group but also the total available capacity at all times. For example, a sudden increase in demand in a certain market could be fulfilled with available capacity that has been freed up by a sudden decrease in another market. We don\u2019t want to lose these opportunities, so it is essential to get the information at high speed and at the right moment to make the right decisions.\u201dDecreasing administrative workload through automation was another critical objective of the project, as Luc continues:\u00a0\u201cThe balancing of supply and demand was a very laborious process, so we wanted to automate it where possible to free up our resources for other activities. The Commercial team, for example, could use that time to investigate markets and gather more information to enrich and increase the accuracy of their forecasts.\u201dThe Project: Capacity and demand planning at a global levelUsing Board with the support of the implementation partner XB4 Consulting, Biobest has successfully balanced capacity with demand in a fully integrated, five-stage process:\u00a0Initializing the process with system-built forecastsCollecting the demand and available production capacity figures at a global levelAggregating and breaking down forecasts at different levels of granularityAllocating available production capacity to demandMeasuring and evaluating forecast accuracyStage 1: Initializing the process with system-built predictive forecastsBoard Enterprise Analytics Modeling (BEAM), an integral feature of the Board platform that uses automated predictive modeling capabilities to produce accurate forecasts at speed, drives the initialization of the process. BEAM provides a baseline for all of Biobest\u2019s forecasts, as Luc explains:\u201cUsing historical sales data, BEAM will search for trends which it can use to forecast our future demand. This provides a useful first step for our Commercial team, who will review the forecasted trend and adapt it where necessary to produce their final forecast. Eventually, when the actuals come in, we can evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts from both Board and the users themselves.\u201dStage 2: Collecting demand and capacity figures at a global levelAt the next stage, the local Commercial teams enter their final forecasts into Board, beginning with the forecast generated by BEAM and using a screen that displays previous and current year actuals for sales and demand. The screen can be filtered with ease, enabling teams to quickly see and edit the information related directly to their region or product range.\u00a0\u201cThe Commercial team can adopt the system-built forecast and adapt it if they wish. Missed sales opportunities from the past are highlighted in the actuals data for the previous year, and this information can be used to prevent the same issue from happening in the future,\u201d continues Luc.\u00a0The Commercial team generates forecasts using customer data, helping improve alignment and better balance capacity with demand. Before Board, the company sent an Excel-based forecast template to customers and distributors to collect this information, but it proved challenging to keep it up-to-date.\u201cIn Board, it\u2019s possible to generate a template containing the latest forecast data. Our customers and distributors will fill it in and send it back, and we can then upload the forecasts into the system. They are keen to participate in this process as it guarantees they will get their product delivered at an affordable price. We\u2019re also taking this a step further; recently, we started a pilot project in which certain distributors have direct access to the Board platform so they can enter their forecasts immediately into our system and review their history with us.\u201d\u00a0Besides gathering data on demand, the Biobest team also needs to combine production capacity data from sites worldwide. Each of the production sites enters its best estimate of production capacity, with Board creating a single source of truth for this information to be used later in the production allocation stage.Stage 3: Aggregating and breaking down forecasts at different levels of granularityOnce the demand and available production capacity figures are forecast at a high level, they are broken down into a lower level of detail, using the concept of a forecast pyramid. \u00a0Biobest Forecast Pyramid Approach for each Planning Unit (PU)\u201cInside many organizations, there are questions around the level of detail at which you should forecast. We use the concept of a forecast pyramid, where predictability is higher at the top, but the detail is lower, and vice versa. You could decide to build a forecast at the top of the pyramid because it\u2019s easy to come to an accurate forecast, but that would lead to inefficient production plans because it lacks enough detail. On the other hand, if you decide to forecast at too low a level, there would be enough detail, but the predictability is lower, so you end up with inaccurate forecasts which are unfavorable for the production department,\u201d explains Luc. \u00a0Biobest uses this concept to identify the optimal level of forecasting aggregation for the production department against three dimensions: week, product group (the type of living component, insect, or mite), and Planning Unit (a commercial division of a Biobest subsidiary).Stage 4: Allocating available production capacity to demand\u00a0At this stage, the local demand of each Planning Unit is aggregated to form the total company-wide demand. As part of Biobest\u2019s continued expansion, new subsidiaries are regularly set up or acquired, and the company is keen to integrate them into the forecasting process as soon as possible. For this reason, different Planning Units forecast demand at different levels, depending on their data maturity and forecasting expertise. The flexible nature of Board, and its ability to deal with top-down and bottom-up planning, make it possible to add new subsidiaries and combine all of this multi-level data with ease.\u00a0\u201cPlanning Units can switch from what we call the \u2018simplified setup\u2019, forecasting at the top level, to the \u2018standard setup\u2019, which is forecasting at the middle level,\u201d says Luc. \u201cAt this point, they will have better insight into their market around why demand suddenly increases or decreases based on certain crops, customers, or periods, for example. They can pinpoint it and use it to improve their demand predictions.\u201d\u00a0Once the local demand has been forecasted, it is then combined with production capacity and used to allocate available capacity to the relevant Planning Units.\u201cWith Board, we moved from a decentralized to a centralized approach. The Planning Units forecast their own demand first, which is then aggregated at a central level. We do the same with production capacity, then we have an algorithm in the system that adheres to certain business rules to work out a proposal, allocating the available production capacity of a certain product to certain Planning Units. Eventually, we will know which production site will produce which product for which Planning Unit. This takes place at the top level of the pyramid, but for certain processes, it might be required at a more detailed level. This is no problem; in Board, you can break it down again to the right level, using the ratio generated when executing the forecasting process, or if you want to go a step lower, you can use the sales history.\u201dAt this stage, Biobest knows precisely how many insects or mites each production site needs to produce. The proposal, worked out by the Board platform, is revised by the head office\u2019s management team and adapted where necessary. Biobest refers to this as the \u201cManagement Allocation,\u201d and here, Board facilitates the fast sharing of accurate data throughout the business.\u201cThe Management Allocation is sent as feedback to the production sites. They are told whether their initial entry of available production capacity was too high or too low and whether action is needed to increase or decrease it. There are a lot of fluctuations in capacity and demand, so the data changes all the time. For this reason, the frequency of executing the production allocation should be as high as possible to get to the right information and communicate it as fast as possible to production sites, so they can take action to ensure high delivery performance,\u201d explains Luc.The outcome of this process is uploaded into Biobest\u2019s ERP system to feed the Available to Promise (ATP) and Material Requirements Planning (MRP) processes.Stage 5: Measuring and evaluating forecast accuracyBiobest measures and evaluates the accuracy of the forecasts at this final stage. Increased accuracy of the forecast leads to a rise in the accuracy of the production allocation. The team performs this using interactive graphical and quantitative analyses in Board, which can easily be filtered by dimensions such as year, time, Planning Unit, and more.\u00a0\u201cIn the graphical analysis, if there is a difference between demand and sales quantity (i.e., missed sales), this is highlighted. We also compare factors such as whether the forecast was entered on time (i.e. before the production process), whether a change caused a deviation during the process, or whether there was a backlog between forecast and demand. There are a lot of elements, but this is no problem; in Board, you can deselect certain elements and keep the ones you are interested in for that particular analysis.\u201dThe quantitative analysis, also in Board, provides details of key KPIs such as forecast errors per week or longer-term forecast performance of particular customer groups or area managers. This information is weighted against how big a forecast error was and eventually used to produce an accuracy cumulation for evaluating the commercial team.\u00a0\u201cOther KPIs include the Mean Absolute Deviation and the Mean Absolute Percentage of Error (MAPE), which tells you overall how good the forecast was. If this stays constant, it can indicate that the shape of your forecast was maybe not that bad, but that there\u2019s something wrong with the volume. For that, we have a third KPI, which is the TRACK value. This will tell you if the forecast is consistently too high or too low. Then you could, in Board, change the figure for total volume, and it will divide the adjustment over the ratio of the selected period. This is a very nice feature in Board.\u201dThe Next Steps: Widening the project scopeThe initial phase of the transformation is now complete. Having realized numerous benefits, Biobest is looking to add more data into Board to improve efficiency further. Luc shares the future direction of the project:\u201cOne of our next steps is to include available production capacity in Board to look at the production yields and statistical control boundaries, to see where we can improve and narrow those boundaries to make it more stable and predictable. These are currently in Excel, and we want to integrate them into Board, with the possibility to change capacity figures based on relevant production yields automatically. We also have the ambition to get our turnover figures into Board, allowing us to calculate average selling prices per market and product and, in the longer term, setting up a budgeting tool in Board. There are several projects in the pipeline and lots more that we can do.\u201dLuc concludes with some final remarks on his experience with Board, and partner XB4 Consulting:\u201cWhere we once had lots of disparate tools in the past to tackle this process, we now have one, nice, integrated solution for the whole process.\u201d\u201cXB4 is a great team of talented consultants, capable to analyze your business and build the platform that allows you to gather your data and evaluate the performance of your enterprise. After delivery, the quality of service does not finish, but is continuous due to a dedicated team that offers you support when needed.\u201dAbout XB4 ConsultingXB4 Consulting is specialized in improving and automating the entire cycle of Corporate Performance Management (CPM) including Strategic Planning, Budgeting, Forecasting, Reporting & Analysis. At XB4, we strongly believe that the era when technical consultants needed functional consultants to translate business challenges into functional specifications is outdated.

        "title": "Creating the perfect partnership between operations and finance at Delos Power",
        "company": "Delos Power",
        "content": "Delos Power is an Italian asset management and O&M Group responsible for a portfolio of photovoltaic power stations. It manages all the solar power plants owned by the Tages Helios and Tages Helios II closed-end reserved real-estate funds managed by Tages Capital SGR S.p.A.With its highly specialized team, Delos Service \u2013 a Delos Group company \u2013 has supported the Tages funds with the rapid growth they have achieved through mergers, acquisitions, and refinancing operations over the past five years. With these funds, the group has invested in photovoltaic systems worth over \u20ac1 billion, achieving 405 MW of installed power.Unification is the common theme of the Board project at Delos Power. By integrating the finance area with the operational activities of the plants, an end-to-end process is created, which:spans economic and financial planning and budgetingenables reporting and analytics using all the group\u2019s information assets, including monitoring solar power plants' performance and productivitycompletes the financial consolidation cycle.Board was first implemented across the entire control and analysis area, creating a single point of truth fed directly by the company\u2019s ERP. The Board platform has become a control tower for Delos\u2019 everyday activities, where operational information aligns with accounting data in real-time. Given the complex structure of the Delos Group, which comprises over 60 companies and 174 photovoltaic power stations, the company needs an information source capable of combining finance with operations. The solar power stations' sites and companies are ordered according to various criteria (e.g. acquisition portfolio, geographical areas, financing banks, and so on) to create multiple consolidated and sub-consolidated accounts:\u201cWe have managed to replicate our corporate structure clearly on the Board platform and have gained access to a very flexible management tool,\u201d explains Marco Sterpi, Head of Reporting, Finance & Treasury. \u201cWhen we acquire a new solar power plant, it\u2019s easy to update the structure. We work directly on the Board database and automatically import the accounting information from the company ERP, thanks to the seamless communication between the BI platform and our business management system.\"When comparing and integrating the revenue data booked in the accounts by the finance area with the revenue data from Delos\u2019s proprietary plant monitoring system, broken down by type (revenues from incentives, electricity, or guarantees of origin), the effectiveness of unified analytics and reporting processes is seen:\u201cThanks to Board, we have achieved fast and smart synergy between Management Control and the Operations Area, giving us higher-quality information, secure validation of said information, and consistent data throughout the organization. We are also minimizing the use of spreadsheets and considerably reducing the margin of error,\u201d observes Massimo Travella.The data quality provides a solid basis for building reports and analyses, particularly cost analyses for specific periods, companies, and the general ledger account at both an overview and itemized level. It also considers the variations between the current year and the previous year while constantly monitoring the difference between budget value and actual value. As Marco Sterpi points out,\u201cBoard\u2019s functions enable us to see the big picture across our information assets, so we can then focus on different levels of granularity, according to our needs. For example, we can look at a single portfolio or at each company belonging to that portfolio, right down to individual photovoltaic power station.\u201dDelos has also used Board to build an application for analyzing costs graphically and intuitively, in such a way where the percentage of total cost and the corresponding budgets of each cost item, business unit, or company accounts is identifiable.\u201cThe introduction of these new Board applications has saved us a great deal of time because, previously, it used to take us ages to do the preliminaries before doing the actual analysis. We used to have to download about 60 trial balances \u2013 one for each company \u2013 one at a time from the ERP, and then import them into spreadsheets and join them together with pivot tables. Before we adopted the Board solution, it used to take us several days to prepare the files before we could even start analyzing the data!\u201d remembers Marco Sterpi.Delos also uses applications built with Board at control level, including intercompany transaction analysis (IC matching) using advanced drill-down capabilities. To do this, Delos has grouped the intercompany general ledger accounts based on specific criteria: from financing between the parent company and its subsidiaries to service provision or fiscal consolidation.\u00a0Marco Sterpi notes:\u201cHere at Delos, our organizational structure is very complex and layered, so we generate intercompany transactions \u2013 both economic and capital \u2013 that need to be managed in a similarly complex and demanding way. Using Board, we assign a \u201ctag\u201d to each intercompany general ledger account according to the nature of the account concerned, thus creating specific groupings. This makes everything much easier and more user-friendly to manage, thanks to clear, intuitive selection functions, and speeds up the performance of this important control process.\u201dCollaborative planning: Finance and operations in a single performance management environmentThe analytics environment on the Board platform integrates with Delos\u2019 financial planning process. The database that feeds the planning process is the same one used to carry out the analyses and generate the reports. This means Delos\u2019 Office of Finance fully aligns with operations, not just in terms of business intelligence but also at every stage of financial budgeting.\u201cInitializing the budget with the Board solution enables us to load information from final accounting data or previous budgets for each cost item. This means we can build various budget versions according to our business needs so that we don\u2019t get snowed under with heaps of separate spreadsheets,\u201d adds Marco Sterpi.Delos\u2019 economic and financial planning and control teams can now collaborate in real-time with the operational teams are advantageous, given the need to adapt to the changes and variations seen in the photovoltaic systems. As Marco Sterpi explains,\u201cThe unification provided by Board, both between planning and analytics and between finance and non-finance areas, makes it simple for us to manage changes. For example, we can evaluate the individual portfolio and arrange the budget by general ledger account, individual reporting unit, supplier, or individual plant. We can also build a workflow by portfolio type to keep track of every planning stage in an interactive, collaborative process.\u201dSmart communication between the monitoring system and Intelligent PlatformThe finance area is fully integrated and synergized with operations and management control thanks to Board\u2019s ability to interact intelligently with the proprietary system Delos uses to monitor the solar power plants. This monitoring system collects a vast range of information from the various components of the photovoltaic power systems, such as the size of the site, how many inverters are in operation, and the number of field cabinets.\u201cThere\u2019s a total of about 7 billion records! Board only collects the necessary data for operational reporting and analytics and for economic and financial planning and budgeting. This interaction gives us end-to-end standardization and industrialization of BI and Corporate Performance Management processes, which enables us to check, in real-time, whether the financial information booked in the accounts matches the operational information recorded by the solar power plant. What\u2019s more, revenues imported into Board can be used automatically in What-If analyses thanks to the platform\u2019s simulation and business modeling capabilities,\u201d explains Marco Sterpi. \u201cVarious dashboards represent the interaction between finance and operations, including dashboards that show us the best and worst solar power plant in terms of production and profitability against the budget and the previous year. Similar evaluations are carried out by analyzing average solar radiation by geographical area.\u201dGuiding Financial ConsolidationAfter completing the planning and analysis process, Delos uses the Financial Consolidation solution developed with Board to create consolidated accounts at an individual portfolio and sub-holding level. This also incorporates generating the consolidated financial statements across the entire group.After importing data directly from the accounting records (the company ERP), the Financial Consolidation process is integrated with relevant management records. The next stage, reconciliation of intercompany items, is strictly limited to companies whose accounting is not managed directly by Delos. This is because the intercompany transactions of internal companies are checked daily by management control using the Board application to perform checks on reconciliations in advance and specific elimination rules on certain accounts.\u201cBoard also enables us to analyze \u2013 in the same environment where consolidation process is implemented \u2013 the relationships between the companies in our group. For example, we can observe the breakdown of commercial or financial payables and receivables of one or more companies,\u201d adds Marco Sterpi.After entering \u2013 in the subsequent adjustment phase \u2013 any management records that fall outside the scope of those used for standard consolidation, the actual consolidation procedure is launched. It ends with the generation of consolidated and sub-consolidated accounts and related reports.For transparency of this key data, it is vital to be able to view every step of the consolidation process (such as loading, elimination method, accounting principles, and so on). The Board Financial Consolidation solution manages the entire disclosure phase, based on the collection and approval of the various parts of financial statements which make up the required documentation.\u201cBoard makes these procedures much easier for its end-users in the finance team by giving them access to the software\u2019s features on a self-service basis with full autonomy,\u201d concludes Marco Sterpi."

        "title": "Efficient reporting, analysis, and planning at Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg",
        "company": "Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg",
        "content": "The new Berlin Brandenburg Willy Brandt (BER) airport at Sch\u00f6nefeld is operated by Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH (FBB). Until October 2020, it was under the same operation as Berlin-Sch\u00f6nefeld (SXF) and Berlin-Tegel (TXL). With more than 35 million passengers in 2019, this is the third-largest airport in Germany. FBB shareholders are the L\u00e4nder of Berlin and Brandenburg, each with a share of 26%, and the Federal Republic of Germany with a share of 37%. FBB has a headcount of around 2,200.The Challenge \u2013 Optimize the group\u2019s reporting systemPreviously, FBB used a variety of disparate reporting and Business Intelligence (BI) systems, which tended to form standalone insular solutions. For many years, the primary system for reporting, analysis and planning was SAP BW, which is fed by various upstream systems. However, this can only be used by trained users and is not an easy system to operate. SAP BW was often used in combination with Excel workbooks created and maintained by the specialist departments but the SAP / Excel combination fell short of the departments\u2019 requirements. In the past, this led to different, sometimes competing, solutions being implemented, resulting in system disruptions and workarounds.\u201cThis goes against the principle of consistent data storage in the Enterprise Data Warehouse. Some of the new Excel solutions only had manual interfaces which made them open to errors,\" explains Andreas Kacerek, Head of Planning & Reporting at FBB.Reliable management reporting is very important for FBB to create transparency and trust among their stakeholders. Incorporating the latest figures, reports are sent to not only internal management, to support operational management, but also to supervisory bodies made up by representatives of the various shareholders of the company. A 60 to 70-page report is created each month and sent as PDF or printout.In 2018, FBB set up a Business Intelligence Competence Center (BICC) with employees from IT and Controlling. The BICC's mission is to ensure governance and a lasting design of a future-integrated BI architecture.\u201cWe are aspiring to the vision of a self-service MIS based on defined and quality-assured key figures. As an all-in-one solution, the new BI solution should enable integrated reporting and planning,\" says Kacerek.High performance and ease-of-use were also required for the sake of end-users. \u201cPower Users\u201d from the departments should be able to create new reports without prior programming knowledge.\u201cWe attach great importance to experts in the specialist departments being able to do as much as possible themselves,\u201d adds Carlo Sapp, Head of Controlling & Accounting. \u201cWith point-of-view commenting, for example, Controlling should be able to quickly and easily explain any deviations from the forecast or previous period, and specialist departments like HR can explain their FTE figures. We also want to create individual dashboards for different areas on our own.\u201dOne important requirement for the reporting system was to replicate the existing layout as far as possible, minimizing the changeover impact for stakeholders. The fixed reporting layout is contrasted with high flexibility, in terms of self-service analyses using drill-down options. This means reports are highly compacted at KPI level, giving Controlling the ability to drill down even deeper to analyze numbers in detail.The final requirement for the entire reporting process was for it to be workflow-driven, so each department knows when and what information they should provide.The Board Solution \u2013 Strong overall packageThe BICC defined the performance requirement for the new system, taking responsibility for selecting the new BI system. To find the right solution, they carried out multiple proofs-of-concept (POCs) with subsequent, detailed preference analysis.Board exemplified, during the POCs, that it is highly capable of meeting all requirements. The Board team also demonstrated its professional working methods exceptionally well. After a Europe-wide call for tenders for a BI and planning tool, the decision was finally made to implement Board.Board\u2019s overall package met the brief, showcasing its ability to:combine planning, analysis, and reporting in an all-in-one platform, while avoiding system disruptionscreate reports with zero-programming requirements perform at a high rate, meeting specific requirements laid out by FBBfeasibly challenge reporting requirements, including pixel-precision printed reportingdirect point-of-view comments option from specialist departmentsseamlessly jump from report to analysis; providing enhanced ability to view detailed information, including drill-through options at SAP document-levelAs the company wanted to keep SAP BW as the leading system, the availability of the Theobald connector was another important factor for Board. The data can be imported directly from SAP into Board via BW queries and hierarchies. With clear data sources and data hierarchies, it is very easy to link to SAP data via the Theobald connector. Further data, e.g. from Project Planning and Finance, will also be integrated via CSV import on the Board platform in addition to the data from SAP.The Board implementation project team consisted of employees of Board and AIOS \u2013 who, as a Board implementation partner, brought in its expertise from multiple projects \u2013 as well as a technical and a specialist employee from the FBB side. Additional professional staff were brought in where necessary, e.g. for HR. The team started work in August 2019, With the concept phase running until the end of October 2019, followed by the implementation phase right up to February 2020. After testing and fine-tuning, the project went into operation on-time and in-budget and is updated on a roll-out basis.As a first step, the Group\u2019s reporting system was migrated from FBB to the Board platform. This includes PDF reports and their printouts, as well as presentation mode. The commentary (point of view) and data analysis options were also implemented.The MIS \u2013 with dashboards, reports, and analyses \u2013 is now being set up by FBB under continuous development. Finance analyzes and presents the financial key figures and financing data for projects. Operations add the aviation figures, including the number of flight movements, passenger, and cargo figures. HR adds reports around staffing numbers. The system also shows the project controlling stats for infrastructure upgrades.Customer Benefits \u2013 Integrated platform increases efficiency In the new reporting system, several years\u2019 financial, personnel, and traffic key figures are presented as actual, forecast, plan, and previous-year figures. Various key figures are commented on at the same time (point-of-view). Shortly after Go Live, it became apparent that the installed workflows and the avoided system disruptions ensure higher data quality and efficiency improvements when setting up a group reporting system. This eliminates the need to send \u201cExcel note files\u201d with consolidated values to the division controllers and then merge them into the group report, because explanations are made in Board itself without any merging required.Initial experience also shows that the user-friendliness of the new Board platform has led to rapid acceptance by controllers.\u201cOnce they get to grips with Board-specific terms like \u201ccapsules\u201d and \u201centities,\u201d and the specific functionalities such as switching between capsules and presentations, colleagues are very happy to adopt the software,\" says Sapp.After a brief induction and coaching, the IT staff at FBB are able to independently define new data models to create operational key figures, and so on. The intuitive use of Board, and the way standardized management reporting interlocks with comprehensive self-service functions, should also lead to the Management using these reports comprehensively and self-sufficiently on the platform. This also eliminates the need to send PowerPoint reports.The FBB team highlights its positive experiences from rolling out Board:\u201cThe duplication approach of reports and dashboards made it surprisingly easy to create more templates. Building KPI rules and investigative approaches is child\u2019s play, especially compared to SAP BW. We were also impressed with how very flexible Board is,\" says Sapp.The next steps will focus on expanding reporting and dashboarding, including setting up the MIS with control-specific dashboards. HR reporting and department-specific aviation reporting and dashboarding are also on the agenda.The planning functionalities for forecasting, operational budgeting, and medium-term planning will then be addressed to further establish an Integrated Business Planning (IBP) system. Reporting is a good starting point, because it sets out the structure, and if you know which metrics need to be reported, you also know which figures to plan.\u201cBoard has so far met all our expectations and we every day we can see more benefits and possibilities brought to us by Board. It is important that further development includes improving our BI architecture and an online-optimized reporting structure,\" says Andreas Kacerek, Head of Planning & Reporting."

        "title": "Automated Budget Reporting and Forecasting at Kiel City",
        "company": "Landeshauptstadt Kiel",
        "content": "The Organization: The State Capital of KielKiel is the most populated city in the northernmost German state of Schleswig-Holstein, with almost 250,000 inhabitants. The city's administration is correspondingly large, with over 5,400 active employees, which in turn are divided into 22 offices, five departments and 13 special divisions. In total, the State Capital of Kiel is responsible for an annual budget volume of more than \u20ac1.2 billion.The Challenge: Lack of a citywide reporting strategyBefore the start of the project, a large number of reports were produced in the various areas. However, these were neither centrally controlled nor standardized in a uniform process. In addition, a city-wide reporting strategy was lacking. Not only were different data sources and statuses used, but due to the lack of a sufficient degree of automation, a significant amount of employees\u2019 capacity was tied up in manual preparation processes. The reporting system was heterogeneous, not standardized, and only offered a historical view.Fast, fact-based decision-making based on accurate key figuresThe State Capital of Kiel decided to develop a central reporting system, pursuing two goals:Establish a sustainable, operational, and strategic reporting system to support all internal performance and decision-makers in a timely manner. Key performance indicators, and data relevant to management, had to be identified and transferred to a central dashboard.Optimize the reporting system at the general strategy level to improve the steering capability and increase transparency for the self-governing body.Within the scope of a tendering process, the State Capital of Kiel enlisted the services of linkFISH Consulting as a local partner with experience in optimizing municipal control processes. To achieve the outlined project goals, the following primary measures were identified in conjunction with the linkFISH team:Reduce heterogeneous and manual (Excel) report generation and distribution by transferring and expanding the reporting processes into a city-wide business intelligence solutionIncrease of the timeliness of information relevant to management and improve transparencyIncrease in the amount of information gained by combining data from different disciplinesIncrease the frequency of household forecasting from annual to a citywide, quarterly forecasting processEstablish uniform standards (e.g., standard reports, catalogs of key figures, etc.) as part of the city-wide reporting systemProvide flexible and programming-free (ad-hoc) analysis functions for all staff members responsible for the reportsTo ensure all the project requirements were met in the most optimal way, the Board Intelligent Planning Platform was chosen. In addition to a wide range of analytics functions offered by the platform, Board also features comprehensive planning capabilities, enabling the mapping of individual forecasting and planning processes.The Board solution: Standardized budget reporting, streamlined forecasting processes, and an interactive dashboard for policymakersWithin only three months, the first project phase \u2013 a comprehensive budget reporting system with actual and planned values based on the municipal budget procedure \"Infoma newsystem\" \u2013 was set up together with the State Capital of Kiel\u2019s project team. In addition, the team defined a new budget forecasting process for the operating and investment budgets in several concept phases, which was then technically implemented.In further expansion stages, case and cost information from social welfare (OPEN/PROSOZ) and youth welfare (KDO youth welfare) have also been integrated into the reporting system. Additionally, the central data pool of the State Capital of Kiel is supplemented by relevant contextual statistical information (e.g., population data & forecasts and Kiel school information).To simplify communication about the project and increase employee identification with the new processes, the system was given the catchy and appropriate name \"COAST\" (Controlling, Analysis and Steering). This, and the visible successes during the implementation phase, led to a noticeable increase in the willingness of all those involved in the project to cooperate as it progressed. For example, politicians\u2019 interest in self-service information grew, so a dedicated policy portal was developed for them as an interactive dashboard in which they can now access the current budget data at any time and from anywhere using the mobile devices provided.The training of all users was completed within a few weeks. Since the project was completed, the competence of the Power Users has been continuously expanded through subsequent sub-projects, such as independent further development of the Board reports. Currently, COAST is used by more than 130 internal city users, and that number is increasing. Support for the existing applications and the strategic planning of further expansion stages is managed by members of the internal finance team, enabling the solution to be business-owned.The Benefits: Less effort, higher information contentThe introduction of COAST has improved many control processes at the State Capital of Kiel and delivered numerous benefits:There has been a significant reduction in the effort required to create and distribute reports thanks to uniform standards, an increased level of automation, and the consolidation of all relevant dataBudgeting data can now be flexibly evaluated along various dimensions such as the product framework (budgets, subplans, products, cost units) and the account and cost center structureCapacity for content-related and qualitative controlling tasks has been freed upMore information with greater relevance can be obtained for recipients by combining data from a wide range of disciplinesFlexible analysis functions (ad hoc analyses) enable better root cause analysis of deviationsBoard is an intuitive software solution that is easy to learn, administer, and develop independentlyInformation quality and transparency has been increased by raising the frequency of forecasts and establishing standard reportsAdditional trust in the cooperation between administration and politics has been created through increased transparency of the budgetLars Ludewig, Project Manager in the Office of Financial Management, Budget, Controlling and Finance IT, is very satisfied with the outcome of the project:The intuitive Board platform makes the know-how transfer tangible for us and enables us to further develop the applications independently, even as specialist users. At the same time, Board can be used extremely flexibly, so that we can, for example, offer an external, interactive dashboard with budget data for politicians."

        "company": "Merz Lifecare",
        "content": "Merz Lifecare is a company of the Merz Group. With its well-known brands, Tetesept and Merz Spezial, Merz Lifecare is one of the leading providers of innovative and high-quality mass-market health, well-being, and beauty products across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The company, which has been family-owned for more than 100 years, is based in Frankfurt, Germany.The Challenge: Creating transparency and simulating impactDue to the increasing internationalization of both retail in general and Merz Lifecare, the company decided a few years ago to restructure its existing pricing and terms system. With a decades-long history of growth, Merz\u2019s pricing and terms system has developed a high degree of complexity across a number of acquisitions in the retail sector. The high manual effort required to maintain and analyze the system (i.e. with Excel and Access) costs the company a high number of resources.Instead, they required a new system that could identify the financial effects of changes in pricing and terms, with detailed simulation capability at item and customer levels. Merz began their search for a suitable software solution that would undertake these tasks.The Board solution: A user-friendly platform that delivers resultsWith Board, Merz Lifecare found a flexible Intelligent Planning Platform that can be used within the specialist department. Board\u2019s ability to simply modify data models alongside its frontend display, on top of being able to perform what-if and scenario analyses, quickly swayed Merz\u2019s decision in favor of the solution.The first task was to implement the new pricing and terms system for Germany in Board. Mapping the new system in Board was an important milestone for us. By harmonizing structures, we achieved much greater transparency. Board also saves us plenty of manual work that used to take up too much of our time\" explains Holger Schweikart, Head of Sales Controlling at Merz.After a successful introduction in Germany, Board was further implemented in Austria and Switzerland, with a number of other areas of application identified along the way.\"The fact that Board can be used flexibly and individually to the needs of different user groups across Sales makes it the perfect software for us. The application soon established itself as an important controlling tool for our everyday sales activities!\" states Holger.The company now controls its entire budgeting and forecasting process in Board, instead of Excel. Among other things, the flexibility of the application allows them to distribute planning figures within customer and item structures according to any freely definable keyword (e.g. previous year figures). In this way, they can regularly record, simulate, and analyze business success across all customers and ranges.The harmonized structures allow teams to check how the various KPIs are performing every day in Sales Reporting. For example, they can use a sales cockpit to view figures by day, month, year, or year-to-date. These distribution and profitability KPIs serve as an important controlling tool for operations.Customer benefits: Extensive use in operationsIn their day-to-day work, sales, marketing, and supply chain teams are seeing enormous benefits from the data and information provided by the Board platform. Sales create an 18-month monthly rolling forecast by month, item, and customer. The forecast numbers are aggregated and sent from Board to the SAP ERP system. From there, the supply chain team determines raw material requirements for the production and supply of the various products, while ensuring that delivery capacity is maintained.To support sales planning, the sales data that is regularly provided can also be read and evaluated through Board.While sales teams are primarily interested in the sales figures from trading partners, marketing views the figures from a product perspective. They can track commercial marketing campaigns \u2013 such as advertising products in weekly offer flyers \u2013 and map the impact on sales figures in a transparent way. With this, the company controls its advertising campaigns specific to each product.The impact of these campaigns is also included in the forecast, which helps ensure delivery capacity. Marketing uses Board's simulation capabilities to replicate the likelihood of success with their new products. Teams can use what-if scenarios to change the different influencing variables and log the most promising parameters. These simulation features are also used in Transition Management, at various points in the product lifecycle, to avoid residual quantities, as well as to calculate quotas and the allocation of goods.Lastly, field service teams at customer sites benefit from the possibilities of the Board platform. Not only can they plan customer visits with Board, but they also have an input screen on their tablet to enter details of local trading partners, (e.g. quantity and dimensions of the shelf space available to Merz). With internal staff loading the number of branches and listed products per trading partner in Board, sales representatives can see which items they can place there. They can also check out the competitive situation on the ground and react to changes.Merz Lifecare is extremely happy with everything Board has been able to deliver for them.\"The Board platform offers us just the all-in-one solution we needed to improve our existing systems and structures\" says Holger. \"Without any programming effort required for Board, we were soon up and running and now we just design our reports and processes ourselves. The fact that Board can be used flexibly and individually to the needs of different user groups across Sales makes the software perfect for us. The application soon established itself as an important controlling tool for our everyday sales activities and delivers a 360\u00b0 picture!\u201d"

The group aimed to create long-term value and thus needed an effective tool to design a new planning and control model, requiring a shift away from its current \"comfort zone.\"Specifically, the group aimed to evolve its financial information management by adopting a new mindset and cross-functional approach to managing numbers. This involved engaging all departments within the consolidation perimeter, regardless of jurisdiction, in rethinking the way financial information is managed.This is best summed up by\u00a0Antonino Volpe, CFO at Syngenta Biologicals:\u201cTo respond effectively and appropriately to the demands of international capital markets and to excel in a competitive arena, it became essential to put the controlling department back at the heart of the business. It was equally important to support it with a flexible technological infrastructure. One\u00a0solution we really felt could do \u00a0all this was the Board Intelligent Planning Platform, which went on to become the group\u2019s holistic information platform.\u201dThe project: An end-to-end planning process capturing short-, medium-, and long-term planningThe data models the Syngenta Biologicals team built in Board\u2019s Intelligent Planning Platform have a wide coverage, including the\u00a0financial ecosystem, operations, HR, and a view across the relevant market.The planning project guided by Board is divided into four sections:Financial & Operational Planning across a one-, three-, and 10-year strategic horizonQualitative Analysis of market, technology, competitive, and regulatory dataSales Forecasting & Analysis (6+6 months)Selling costs: End-year rebates | Sales commission & Incentives | Commercial Cost | Marketing Cost | Distribution CostR&D \u2013 G&A costs, HR costs \u2013 Operative & Training costs, COGS Model, InvestmentsNet Sales & Gross Profit, including priority focus (by Country, Product, Biostimulant, or New Product)Monitoring and Tracking by Coherence Check PointsAt the top of the organizational pyramid, the objective was to integrate the annual plan with the three-year plan, and the three-year plan with the ten-year plan. Across the entire planning cycle, there is a set of\u00a0\u201cCoherence Check Points\u201d, designed to support the meetings held for the purpose of discussing and approving the planning steps.The planning process is seamlessly combined with sales forecasting & analysis, that covers a 6 + 6 months horizon.The benefits: Holistic planning and collaborationWith the project and the range of coverage it has implemented in the organization, Syngenta Biologicals benefits in many relevant areas. These include:Rapid understanding of meaningful and critical business drivers across the Board Intelligent Platform, rather than being swamped by an excess of information. This is important in Syngenta Biologicals' industry, where changes in demographics, cultivatable areas, and agricultural technologies are easier to understand in medium/long-term scenarios and are more qualitative than quantitative.Cross-functional collaboration across different departments to design planning applications which address the company\u2019s needs.: These include a continuously incremental approach that enables people to establish a virtuous circle of sharing and develop alternative planning versions that draw ever closer to an \u201cideal standard\u201d structure.A holistic information network that interconnects planning processes across economic, financial, and capital-related planning\u00a0for the\u00a0medium term\u00a0(three-year plan),\u00a0short term\u00a0(annual plan) and\u00a0very short term\u00a0(interim forecasting 6+6 months), including sales forecasting.\u00a0Mila Miscia, Controlling Manager at Syngenta Biologicals, concludes:\u00a0\u201cSyngenta Biologicals' employees now use\u00a0an\u00a0agile approach\u00a0in their everyday work because it helps measure design steps easily, adjust the company\u2019s trajectory towards targets quickly, and, most importantly, face up to the unknown - whether in the form of a project or planning scenario- with less fear.\u201dSince the start of the project, Syngenta Biologicals' use of Board has continued to grow. The company has increased the granularity of its planning models, transforming the large volume of data accumulated over a number of years into insights on which to base prompt, effective decision-making. As a result, people\u2019s confidence in and appreciation of the software have increased as well.\u00a0"

Today, their assets reach 9.4 billion in total, with a supervisory capital of \u20ac319 million, 156,000 customers, 460 employees, more than 56,000 shareholders, and more than 10,000 young people under 30 forming part of the company cooperative.Banca d\u2019Alba operates with 73 branches that serve 290 municipalities across 7 provinces of Piedmont and Liguria.Its crowning achievement in the non-banking area is its social healthcare activity aimed towards their shareholders and where it operates. Over the past 20 years Banca d\u2019Alba has provided 1.5 million physiotherapy treatments in its 5 medical centres free of charge.The challenge: Creating an effective framework for management control, business intelligence, and risk managementTen years ago, Banca d\u2019Alba needed to improve and optimise their planning and control process, from the distribution of management reporting to the branches (for detailed analysis) up to the development of a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) system for tracking and monitoring strategic information. With these requirements, the challenges that arose were around reorganizing workflows to integrate the planning, management control, and budget process into a single platform \u2013 with the top-down interactions typical of general management, and the bottom-up approach of branch managers \u2013 and \u00a0speeding up the flow of reports available to branch managers and controllers.Over the years, Banca d\u2019Alba was aware of the need to build an efficient risk management framework in response to the \u00a0increasingly strict changes imposed by regulators and the market. In 2011, Banca d\u2019Alba looked towards advanced digital tools to run advanced analytics and performance management, moving towards improved decision-making processes of their managers and senior executives. With these innovative technologies, Banca d\u2019Alba could support their decision-makers with Business Intelligence (BI), Corporate Performance Management (CPM), and predictive analytics tools capable of responding to the risks and rapid changes in the financial world, keeping in line with international best practices while maintaining full control of the operational costs involved in implementing risk management methodologies.Another important aspect for Banca d\u2019Alba was \u00a0the progressive ability to develop an increasingly close collaboration between the strategic and financial areas, and the operational departments, who wereadopting Board as a shared platform, to obtain the maximum advantages presented by digital transformation.The high-level customization of processes, and an integrated risk management application, represents a very important tool for assessing risks and making the best decisions, leveraging the large amount of data available.An end-to-end solution for strategy, control, assessment, and forecastingThe applications implemented together with BIOS Management, a Board partner, have been transformed into the development of a planning environment on the Board Intelligent platform: an information analysis solution that supports the decision-making process, guaranteeing speed, ease of use, quick application development, and interactive business modelling. The initial project focused on a Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) solution, which included a budgeting process for assets, liabilities, and services, as well as forecasting at the end of each year. Perfectly integrated within the solution, Banca d\u2019Alba uses Board for management reporting and BI, with KPI and dashboards created for executive roles.Thanks to the Board platform, we are generating a three-year strategic plan\u201d \u2013 affirms the Analysis and Research Manager of Banca d\u2019Alba \u2013 which is transformed into an annual operational budgeting process for each department, including Sales & Marketing, and for each function dedicated to the management of interest income, financing, interest originating from own securities, bank transfers, credit/debit cards, POS, etc.On a management control level, analyses have been perfected on the Board platform to measure the profitability of customers, branches, and products. A cost allocation process has been developed also.Board makes it possible for Banca d\u2019Alba to analyze and share company data, from the final figures and budgets, for each individual branch, down to the products and customers, in order to best obtain a complete and accurate view of the situation.Some of the main processing operations that have been developed include:strategic planning and budgeting workflow for the balance sheet (deposits and loans) and the income statement (interest margins, revenues from services and costs), which can then \u00a0detail provisional data for each organizational unit on a monthly basis and by customer cluster;specific forecast functions, estimating the year closure based on final data, provisional data, and possible adjustments;management reporting, with monthly, weekly, and daily monitoring through specific operative reports, with gap analysis vs budget.\u00a0By perfectly combining management control with the intelligent functionalities of Board \u2013 continues the manager \u2013 Banca d\u2019Alba was able to integrate: analysis of customer behavior, consumption type and habits (for example, use of on-line services or at a brick and mortar bank), customer profiling (by demography, profession, geography, etc.); competitive market positioning, evaluating and comparing internal information with external information (population, number of residents, etc.) to understand how our bank is positioned in the market.Furthermore, BI within Board has been enhanced with the Board BEAM module, which is dedicated to advanced and predictive analytics. With BEAM, Banca d\u2019Alba is starting their first processes of customer \u00a0clusterization, simulation, and scenario management, to evaluate credit deterioration and customer churn rate.\u00a0From this, Banca d\u2019Alba are hoping to best capitalize on the value of their customer base by better managing their marketing through strategic insight and pushing offers to the right customer clusters.Among the most important solutions created and implemented on the Board platform, the Analysis and Research manager pointed out the risk management application that manages, controls, and analyzes bad debt - integrating a workflow and providing stakeholders with a decision-making dashboard that delivers a complete and accurate overview:One of the most innovative projects was the introduction of the Risk Management solution integrated with Management Control. This solution created on Board was specifically studied by the University of Bergamo, which published it as a concrete case study in the Management Control scientific journalThe large wealth of information managed by a bank - if equipped with suitable technology, such as Board\u2019s decision-making software \u2013 enables users to not only identify and make productive use of information that would otherwise remain 'in the shadows'; but to also improve decisions by considering risks and monitoring the quality of credit portfolios, making it possible to make swift changes, as needed, to avoid losses and take advantage of opportunities in a proactive manner.For the banking and financial services sector, Board is a truly powerful tool: at Banca d\u2019Alba we have been able to combine strategic planning, operative budgeting, risk management and strategic marketing on a single platform\u00a0- concludes the manager"

In 2019 alone they will rescue 64 million pounds of food and deliver it, free of charge, to hundreds of food pantries, soup kitchens, and other community partners across the city\u2019s five boroughs. City Harvest\u2019s programs empower individuals through nutrition education, increase their partners\u2019 capacity, and strengthen the local food system, helping New Yorkers who are experiencing food insecurity to access, afford, and consume nutritious food. \u00a0\u00a0The ChallengeCity Harvest maintains an ambitious growth plan, thus recognized a need to ensure that administrative processes work as efficiently as possible to address the organization\u2019s multi-faceted business model, including food rescue and distribution, community engagement, and fundraising. They identified the following areas of improvement in financial administration:Streamline the budgeting process for the entire organizationMeet budget timelines and create actionable reportsReduce staff costs and time spent on budgetingEnsure a uniform standard of finance staff\u2019s technology proficiency and provide extra training as neededEstablish uniform sources for financial and operational dataStreamline decision-making and data entry processes\u00a0The SolutionThe evaluation journey included thorough research and review of several budgeting and business intelligence solutions, including Adaptive, Vena, Infor, BI360, Budget Masetro, Power Plan and Board. City Harvest selected Board for its power to connect systems and information into one single source, and to replace the use of nearly 200 spreadsheets for one budget season. Excel proved to be too manual and time-consuming for the City Harvest team, which contributed to budget timeline delays.Additionally, City Harvest manages many projects happening daily across the organization. Prior to implementing Board (which was completed with Board partner, Corporate Renaissance Group), there was no single platform to generate the different accounting segments, so each project had to be managed on individual Excel sheets. \u201cBoard had the functionality and flexibility we were looking for. It was customizable, intuitive, streamlined, and refined financial information.\u201d \u2013 Javier Garcia, Senior Financial Analyst, City Harvest\u00a0The ResultsUsing Board, City Harvest removed many tasks and increased efficiency around the administration of budgets, report creation, and manual checking of work. These benefits, in conjunction with having fewer spreadsheets, have made managers more capable of accessing information and reports quickly. Managers reduced the need to go through the finance team and different sources to access information; it\u2019s right at their fingertips in Board and the connected General Ledger (GL) system.Board has made it easier for managers to work with and understand their budget. This has improved the participation-in and accuracy of City Harvest\u2019s budgets. Now the team spends more valuable time reviewing budgets to ensure continued sound fiscal management of City Harvest.The City Harvest team is proud to have achieved a budget process that is 20 days shorter. In the future, City Harvest plans to integrate other financial data from different sources (such as employee salary and benefits information) into Board so that all financial information is housed in one place.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

With its long-term growth perspectives, the company thus supports both society and industry in the transition to a sustainable world.Challenge: Replacing an outdated software and achieving a future-proof solutionThe finance department at Phoenix\u00a0Contact was faced with a challenging scenario. Its existing planning solution was approaching end-of-maintenance. In addition, performance and usability no longer met the department\u2019s requirements. In partnership with KPMG Germany, the team began evaluating new software for planning the group\u2019s finances in the future.\u00a0\"We took a close look at the market overviews by analysts such as BARC, Forrester and Gartner, while also incorporating the experience we have gained from several projects at KPMG,\" said Ilker Dinc, Project Manager at KPMG. \u201cWe finally narrowed down the group of potential vendors to two, whom we asked for proof-of-concepts.\u201dDuring this process, Board's Intelligent Planning solution became the clear choice for the project team. Thomas Bremes, Inhouse Consultant at Phoenix\u00a0Contact recalls,\"We have a large internal user community for the planning software. Therefore, it is important that users can operate the application intuitively. We liked Board's planning screens from the start in terms of visual design. In addition, all processes for the use cases could be mapped easily. Above all, Board was able to react flexibly to all requirements.\"\u00a0Solution: Flexible, intuitive, and efficientPhoenix\u00a0Contact opted to use the cloud version of Board's Intelligent Planning Platform to redesign its group financial planning\u2014modeling important planning processes on the platform. This includes integrated financial planning, P&L consolidation, and investment planning, which was the first application to be implemented.\u00a0\"We quickly realized that we needed to first modernize our existing planning processes before transferring them into Board,\" explains Thomas Bremes. \"At the same time, all of us familiarized ourselves with the new software.\"\u00a0Agile planning meets flexible platform: a swift solution for ESG reporting and control\u00a0It was during this time that the project team received an urgent request from the Quality Management and Compliance department. A swift solution for ESG reporting was needed and the finance department was asked for support. In the past, such tasks were performed in Excel with huge effort on administration and organization. Phoenix\u00a0Contact's current ESG reporting includes topics related to the environment, such as the proportion of recycled materials and fuel consumption, as well as social topics, such as the composition of the workforce.Marcus Mathes, responsible for ESG reporting at Phoenix\u00a0Contact, explains: \"We have many subsidiaries providing data on group level on ESG. We needed a sophisticated access control system with granular authorization concepts as well as a solution that allowed us to visualize nearly 100 KPIs in a concise way.\"The Board implementation project team quickly decided that Board was an ideal platform for this task, and they prioritized the ESG reporting use case to showcase the agility and power of the platform. The ESG solution now easily collates data centrally and connects different areas and locations.\u00a0\u201cThe application creates accountability and support users to be precise. In addition, it is very user-friendly and data entry is easy, as relevant information on the required data is always available. This has a very positive effect on data quality and user acceptance,\" says Marcus Mathes. \"Not to mention the significantly reduced amount of time we need to spend on administrative tasks.\"The development of the application was extremely fast\u2014less than 2 months.\"We never felt like we were at a point where we had to say this couldn\u2019t be done. Board is so flexible that it is easy to adapt to different requirements. For example, the general user administration in Board is very well designed. This made it easy to implement the detailed authorization concept,\" explains Tim Leikeim, Technical Project Manager at KPMG. \"Thanks to the agile development, we were able to onboard users smoothly, specifically because of the outstanding interim results that continued to inspire us.\"It is hardly surprising that feedback from users has been highly positive. \"The intuitive user experience makes it simply fun to work with. Not to mention the significantly reduced amount of time we need to spend on administrative tasks,\" says Marcus Mathes. \"The intuitive UX/UI also reduces the training time to a minimum. One afternoon is enough to familiarize users with the system.\"\u00a0The development of the initial ESG application was a win-win for the entire project team. Thomas Bremes from Finance agreed.\"This was an ideal, hands-on project to quickly familiarize ourselves with the Board platform. In addition, at Phoenix\u00a0Contact we assume that non-financial data, such as we have with ESG, and traditional financial data will increasingly grow together in planning. Thus, we have already taken a step in the right direction here.\"Ilker Dinc agrees entirely: \"This is a typical example of how finance and non-finance topics can come together to provide the big picture. It also showcases how finance can provide support to other areas by supplying and orchestrating the platform for others to share.\"\u00a0Customer benefits: Rapid development of new applications regardless of ITAgile, flexible, and fast \u2013 the example of ESG reporting showcases how Board supports companies\u2019 diverse requirements.\u00a0As Thomas Bremes describes it, \"We now have a platform where we can develop various applications for planning, reporting, and analytics. The modular approach allows us to increase the maturity level with each new application. From the ESG project, we extracted valuable knowledge and practical ideas for investment planning. These are different puzzle pieces that interlock to provide a coherent overall picture.\"Tim Leikeim supported this, adding, \"If something works well in one area and there is positive feedback from coworkers, then it is much easier to gain acceptance from users in other areas. They then approach the new applications with a much more positive attitude.\"And since the IT department does not need to be involved at all times, projects can be developed quickly and without bottlenecks. \u201cWith Board, we can quickly implement new ideas in specialist departments. We can build mock-ups in a very short time to get a feeling of how the requirements may be implemented. We can then do this entirely by ourselves,\u201d says Thomas Bremes.Picture source: Phoenix Contact GmbH & Co. KG"

        "content": "The rising cost of healthcare is a huge challenge. Particularly in the supply of pharmaceuticals, kohlpharma wants to make an active contribution to ensuring high-quality, yet affordable care.Since the company was founded in 1979, kohlpharma has continuously expanded its pharmaceutical import business in Germany. As a family-run and independent medium-sized company, kohlpharma cares about the needs and interests of its customers - pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesalers. kohlpharma is particularly committed to strengthening owner-operated on-site pharmacies. They are the backbone of a patient-oriented pharmaceutical supply throughout Germany.The Challenge: Provide data quickly and reliably for the sales departmentkohlpharma had several programs in use for planning, reporting, and analysis, but they no longer met today's requirements. The possibilities of reporting per target group were limited, automatic imports were not possible so that data had to be updated manually and combining multiple data sources required considerable effort.kohlpharma's sales department needed an easy-to-use solution that delivered up-to-date figures on their fingertips for the different target groups. The goal was to build a system with consistent and up-to-date data that all parties involved could access at any time to make planning and controlling easier and faster.\u00a0The Solution: Mobile applications with a high degree of self-serviceAfter evaluating several solutions, kohlpharma selected Board. Board's Intelligent Planning Platform is easy and intuitive to use and provides the flexibility needed to cover all requirements. The workflow functions make it very easy to automate processes. Aline Petri, Manager Strategic Marketing at kohlpharma, emphasized the importance of a self-service platform:\"It was particularly important to us that the users can create their applications independently. This is the only way we can react quickly to the changing requirements we encounter in our daily operations. Board Professional Services supported and trained us at the beginning in such a way that we could quickly take over the further development of applications and the maintenance of the system ourselves.\u201dThe project started in 2017 with two consultants from Board. Within just two weeks, the data was available, and the first applications were set up. After only four months, the rollout to the field sales force took place. This was followed by applications for internal sales. Since then, the system has been independently maintained by kohlpharma's IT department and continuously developed with the users.In addition to its merchandise management system, a data warehouse, and a CRM system, kohlpharma connected various external data sources. This includes market figures from external providers. This data is automatically imported and updated - without any manual effort - and then used on an aggregated level in Board.As the market leader, kohlpharma is always looking to advance itself and to drive digitalization in the pharmacy market. To this end, the field service application was adapted to a mobile solution in 2022 so that Board can be used on the iPad while on the move. This allows employees to prepare the customer visits efficiently and to discuss order proposals directly with customers on site.The Customer Benefit: Perfect preparation and more time for customersInternal sales as well as field sales now benefit from up-to-date figures and clearly structured analyses that Board automatically provides every day.\u00a0\"The first thing I look at in the morning is the current data. As a team, we now have more time to look at the data and derive actions. I guess I save 20% of my time every day that I would otherwise spend preparing the data. It's fun to work with Board,\" said Aline.The sales force in the field is also very satisfied with the way Board supports them, identifying trends and showing which products are currently in demand.\u00a0Aline reported: \"Our field staff save time twice over. First, the preparation time for the visit to the customer is significantly shorter. They can see all the necessary data at a glance and immediately recognize what the customer needs. They can make customer-specific order suggestions. This allows them to make better use of the time in the pharmacy and shorten it.\"The future: Expansion into other business areaskohlpharma is connecting more and more departments and adding new applications all the time to its intelligent planning solution.\u00a0\u201cWhen we add new users, we train them internally directly on the system in a practical way. For users who are familiar with advanced functions of Excel, the transition to Board is a breeze. Today, we have about 20 power users across the various departments. A total of about 115 users are currently working with the system, and the trend is rising,\" explained Aline.The experience with Board has been so positive that the sales department was also able to convince the controlling department to work with Board when it had to decide on a new planning solution."

It also needed to\u00a0facilitate queries and the rapid creation of reports and dashboards.After evaluating IBM Cognos, Tableau, Board International and Qlik, ARG selected Board International as the best platform to meet their needs.\u201cWe were particularly impressed with the broad range of reports and analyses we could create in record-setting time,\u201d said Mr. Zolkos.\u00a0\u201cOnce database connections are made, it\u2019s extremely easy to design and produce reports and analyses.\u00a0 Our business partners around the company are amazed at how quickly we can turn around analyses they request, and how Finance is increasing our overall impact on the entire business.\u201d\u00a0The ImplementationInstallation of the Board Platform took one week, after which ARG developers quickly designed and implemented applications to service a broad spectrum of the company\u2019s business.\u00a0 With a new team of employees trained in developing on the Board Platform, they developed and deployed applications to produce analytical reports on virtually every aspect of the company\u2019s finances, creating financial statements, KPI\u2019s, and reports on sales, inventories, costs, margins, taxes, production planning, and expense analyses.\u00a0The BenefitsMr. Zolkos estimates that the Board Platform has saved ARG hundreds of hours and related expenses compared with the time and expenditures spent closing their books at the end of each quarter in the past.\u201cMoreover, we\u2019ve improved our decision-making timeline and have been able to redirect more time to more value-added activities.\u201dARG has also proliferated its use well beyond financial reporting, planning and analysis to other functions like Sales, Customer Service, Logistics and Operations to provide reporting and trend analysis to help them manage their areas more effectively. The reports that the logistics team receives daily have reduced truck demurrage costs (thousands of dollars annually) by planning orders more effectively as well as saving their customer services reps a significant amount of time in managing daily workload.\u00a0\u00a0"

        "title": "The North West Switzerland University of Applied Sciences",
        "company": "The North West Switzerland University of Applied Sciences",
        "content": "Board offers completely new opportunities for reportingThe CompanyThe North West Switzerland University of Applied Sciences (FHNW) is one of the leading applied sciences universities in Switzerland. It operates in an innovative, practice-orientated way, comprising of nine colleges for teaching, research, further education and services. Its wide range of courses, hands-on attitude, application-orientated approach highly innovative research and global network make the FHNW an attractive, diverse educational establishment, a sought-after practice partner and an attractive employer in North West Switzerland.The ChallengeTransparency at the university - MIS (Management Information System) with financial and non-financial key performance indicatorsThe FHNW is characterized by its three major systems that cover the university\u2019s different requirements. Financial and HR data are available in SAP, personnel resources are planned using the workload tool (a bespoke development) and student administration is managed in Evento. This makes efficient evaluation of combined data difficult and complex. With an annual turnover of 445 million Swiss francs and 2,700 staff (as at 2016), the need to control the organization using modern, reliable reporting is vital. Also, with more than 2,400 research, further education and services projects administered by the FHNW, corresponding reports were being emailed to 500 project managers.In 2015, the Control Managers started a project aimed at speeding up the digitization process in reporting, to develop the control process at the FHNW from a purely data-orientated function to a consulting-orientated function.More consultancy + less data management = more benefitsThe vision was to combine management information into a single system, with the aim of taking more time to evaluate the data in order to support decision-makers more specifically in their deliberations and to be able to show trends over several years.Using historical data, there was a desire for the reporting system to uncover developments and trends at the touch of a button using dynamic time axis comparisons - whether this involved the origin of the students or profit margin trends in research.\u00a0There was also a desire to provide the respective managers with the latest data in an easily understandable form, which would require a central platform to act as a single point of truth, that could be accessed at any time from anywhere. Finally, manual input for reporting was to be reduced to a minimum.The Board SolutionOnce the need for the new solution had been realised, the FHNW Control Department spent time carefully defining which reports were necessary and analyzed which systems could create these in the best possible way. After seeing various solutions the team opted for Board and \u00a0together with Board experts, was able to implement the initial requirements of the project within just five months.\u00a0The implementation took place in two logical layers, with the technical IT basis forming the lower layer. The different system components run on a SQL server, such as the Data Warehouse in which complex ETL processes (Extract, Transform, Load) are mapped. In addition, the project team also decided to introduce a master data management system (MDS) to enhance and monitor master data in order to keep track of some 1,500 active profit centers and approximately 15,000 historical accounting assignments (projects/cost centers/internal orders).Business applications form the upper layer. Board is used here to access the data in the lower layer to compile the reports. This division enabled the work to be distributed\u00a0 across the Business (Control) and IT departments.Currently about 50 staff from the upper management levels use the Board solution and at project manager level there are around 400 users who have access to the Board web platform. The platform is easy to use and can be modified flexibly to suit the respective purposes. It was very important for the FHNW that the Board system could be administered by the users in their daily business (control) without programming knowledge being necessary.The project support team consists of only four people who received technical support from the IT Department. The external specialists only gave support with the introduction and have consequently no longer been required to date. The use of Board at the university is to be extended gradually.\u00a0Customer BenefitsRegardless of whether it involves financial reports, personal data, student surveys or the university\u2019s extended service mandate, everything can now be mapped on a single platform.The major advantages are:Extremely user-friendly interfaceAd hoc evaluations can be created quickly and easilyFast preparation of complex reportsData drill down possible (from the approximate to the detailed)Ability to switch to the associated documents (for example vendor invoices in PDF format)Integration of process control rules (project check)Simple control of the release of reporting periods\u00a0Another important benefit for the university is geomapping. As a university that is close to the border, it is extremely important for decision-makers to know where their students come from and also to be able to display this visually.The next step consists of optimizing and further developing the reports and screens created. The FHNW has constant discussions with users in order to hone the content and, if necessary, make it more understandable. New requirements from other areas dealing with reporting, for example from HR or Property, are continually added and developed."

        "content": "The Company: A\u00a0leading motorcycle accessories\u00a0retailerBased in J\u00fcchen near D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, POLO Motorrad und Sportswear GmbH is a leading supplier of motorcycle clothing, accessories, and technology.\u00a0During 40 years in the market, the company has expanded to 90 shops across Germany, Switzerland, and Austria and, along with its website and mail-order channels, offers a range of more than 65,000 products.The Challenge: Lack of transparency and performance in planning processesTo ensure the continued success of the company, POLO decided to implement an integrated planning solution that would replace the legacy approach and increase the efficiency of the process. This was accompanied by the desire for a higher level of detail, greater transparency, an increase in order proposal accuracy by taking into account additional parameters, and a significant increase in performance. The new solution also had to be integrated company-wide to improve collaboration.\u00a0Having selected the Board decision-making platform, which unifies analysis, planning, and forecasting capabilities in a single interface, POLO worked with Board partner celver AG to implement the solution.\u00a0The Solution: A\u00a0fully integrated planning and reporting platformWith Board in place, POLO\u2019s new planning approach includes annual sales planning for the entire product range as well as a subsequent automatic rolling forecast. A dynamic workflow in Board ensures that every planner always knows what to plan and when.In the first step, a fully automated planning opening takes place, in which a planned sales proposal per item, month, and country is determined for around 98% of all products. New articles are evaluated via complex clustering or optionally via extrapolation. Proposed plans for existing items are determined using factors such as trends, past and future availability, and sales promotions.\u00a0After initialization, the first evaluation in terms of planned sales, margins, crude yields, commodity inserts, inventory turnover speed (LUG), and Gross Margin Return on Investment (GM ROI) is undertaken by planners, either per item or by highly aggregated groups such as brand or product type.\"As comfortable, efficient, and reliable as automated planning is, it is essential to know about special events and have the necessary flexibility for this,\" says Oliver Weichselsdorfer, Head of Goods Control, MaWi Controlling & BI Architecture at POLO.As such, the assortment planner can optionally add new growth rates to products, styles, articles, or entire brands and mark the selected area as planned. This means that all stakeholders in the process can always see what has already been planned and by whom. It also gives the assortment planners the opportunity to incorporate their own experience and knowledge of future influencing factors at any time.A separate dynamic validation area in Board monitors ongoing planning and raises alerts for errors such as over/underplanning, exceeded margin limits, or missing or incorrect parameters.After successful validation and approval of the high-level plan, an automated initialization per item, tag, and country takes place, from which, for example, a goods receipt forecast per product group or a budget plan per supplier can be derived.At the same time, all planned items are included in the daily rolling forecast. This forms the basis for accurate demand planning in the form of daily order proposals for the entire range. Here, the stored calculation logic considers the optimal order quantity, minimum order quantity, delivery time, safety buffer, minimum stock, and residual requirements.Not only is the next order date calculated, but all order times and quantities up to the end of the planning period. On this basis, the impact on liquidity can be realistically predicted. The purchaser will be shown the items to be ordered daily with all relevant information.In addition, Board checks whether an item size within the style will reach the minimum stock level and whether this size can trigger an order for the corresponding style. If this is the case, the order for this item, as well as other related items, will be offered. The planned order for individual sizes within the style is based on the optimal size distribution according to the associated cluster.As well as planning functionality, celver\u2019s consultants also implemented comprehensive reporting on the Board platform, including sales and product analyses as well as monetary and volume-based action reporting. POLO uses price-quantity-effect analyses to identify factors influencing sales and price.\u00a0Inventory analysis is also available to support activities such as the production of advertising flyers, giving POLO transparency over the changing inventory levels of relevant products for promotion.The Benefits: Full transparency and increased purchasing & delivery efficiencyBoard has enabled POLO to ensure optimal stock levels and on-shelf availability in line with demand, thanks to the presence of up-to-date order proposals based on the rolling forecast. In addition, planned orders now play a key role in the purchasing procedure.\"Thanks to the forecasting and resulting order proposals, we can provide our suppliers with a reliable forecast at any time. Despite the number of items in our assortments having increased enormously in recent years, a staff increase has not been necessary,\" explains Ingo Junge, Head of Dispatch at POLO.In fact, just four POLO employees in the Dispatch team manage 65,000 items across 250 suppliers throughout the country \u2013 from the determination of requirements to the processing of order confirmations.\"Board drives a process-led approach, which is why today we order much more efficiently and economically,\" continues Ingo.Full transparency of stock levels and demand now contributes significantly to the optimal distribution of products between individual stores and the central warehouse.\"Fewer sale items, reduced stock storage, and less warehouse staff combined with smaller quantities have reduced unnecessary costs and released additional liquid funds. We have already been able to gain considerable capital,\" adds Oliver.In addition to cost reduction, the knowledge of expected demand enables long term \"posting\" of orders. This ensures that the supplier provides capacity when requested by POLO, keeping delivery rates high, preventing lost sales and ensuring customers are satisfied.The Future: Enhancement and expansionCurrently, 50 users \u2013 from the CFO to administrators \u2013 use Board, with more due to be added in the future. The solution is also due to be expanded to cover cashflow planning for financial accounting and annual sales/revenue planning as part of ongoing development activities."

        "title": "The metals specialist can now make informed decisions through transparent supply chain processes with Board.",
        "company": "Aurubis",
        "content": "Aurubis AG is a leading global supplier of non-ferrous metals and one of the world's largest copper recyclers. The materials it sources are critical for future technologies, as they are needed for key components in smart, connected products. Across renewable energies, e-mobility, digitalization, and urbanization, the demand for these metals will continue to rise.\u00a0Challenge: Integration of data for efficient supply chain planningSupply chain management is a decisive success factor in the smelting of metals. Yet, \u201cmanual, slow, error-prone, not integrated, and Excel-heavy!\u201d is how Nick Materzok, Program Manager at Aurubis AG, described the company\u2019s historical supply chain planning approach, prior to a transformational planning project with Board.\u00a0\u201cOur goal is to become the most efficient and sustainable smelter network in the world. With over 30 mining partners in the metal concentrate business, efficient purchasing and operations planning is a key factor in achieving our ambitious goal,\" explained Nick Materzok.\u00a0There are 24 elements and 50 different material qualities that have a pivotal influence on production and must be considered carefully by purchasing. The raw materials come from across the globe. Disruptions in available quantities as well as changes in the quality of the material quickly affect production.\u00a0\"Our scenario planning was very inefficient. What happens, for example, if there is a ship jam at the Panama Canal and deliveries arrive late? We first had to painstakingly compile the necessary data for the scenario, which takes a lot of time. In addition, we were very limited in terms of what we could simulate and how we could create scenarios,\" said Materzok.At the beginning of 2020, Aurubis decided to migrate and standardize its supply chain planning processes as part of an Aurubis Planning System (APS) program. The goal was to increase transparency of planning with a single point of truth. The company also wanted to integrate all planning modules on one platform to enable quick, well-informed decision-making through ad hoc, cross-functional analyses.\"Since our planning modules are very complex and diverse, yet all somehow intertwined, we needed a modern planning solution with a high degree of flexibility, into which we could also easily integrate third-party engines,\" Materzok explained.Solution: Simulation and scenario building based on comprehensive dataAurubis held a series of discussions with software suppliers and invited four to present a demo. Staff were then challenged to evaluate the proof-of-concepts presented. In the end, Board, and its implementation partner, celver AG, prevailed over industry specialists. Materzok shared:\"We had a good feeling about Board and celver right from the start, partly because they acted as partners at eye level. The good cooperation was then confirmed in the project. Things do not always go smoothly, but by sharing the goal of creating something good, you manage to find solutions!\"\u00a0The usability of the Board platform also impressed the panel. \"With Board, we can flexibly design screens in a user-friendly way. This creates acceptance among users and helps with project success,\u201d said Sebastian Jakob, Head of Business Unit CMP at Board\u2019s partner celver AG.\u00a0The joint implementation team set up the Board Intelligent Planning Platform, which integrates multiple aspects of supply chain planning and purchasing simulation in one place.\u00a0\"We opted for an agile and incremental approach, moving away from rigid specifications to user stories,\" said Materzok. \"Together with a clear focus on the product vision, this helps to drive the projects in a targeted way. We can learn from the first projects and benefit from the insights in the later phases. When it comes to data connection, for example, there are a lot of synergies that can be exploited if you take a coordinated approach.\"\u00a0The first phase focused on purchasing and production planning in the scrap & blister material cluster. Goals were to reduce error-prone manual input processes and increase forecast accuracy using scenario analyses in procurement planning. Board is now used operationally to issue purchasing, transfer, and consumption mandates for the material cluster.In another purchasing simulation project, where the focus is set on metal concentrates, the company sought to accelerate processes so it can respond more quickly to the market. The goal was to respond to requests from suppliers for purchasing materials within 24 hours. In this context, the new Board SCM platform will help to match not only the quantity but also the quality of the purchased raw materials with the long-term production program.In practice, this means that data for the delivery forecast is automatically sourced and prepared for the planner in Board. A user can see which quantity and quality of concentrate materials are planned. Then, in a personal Board view, they can run through various scenarios: What happens if a ship does not arrive or is delayed due to problems on international shipping routes? Planners can change the relevant parameters, and the system calculates what effect this will have on inventory capacities. Do they remain in the green zone between the min and max limits\u2014or is the purchasing agent compelled to act?\"The system does not only take into account possible quantity deviations. If a delivery fails to arrive and the purchasing agent has to obtain the material from another mine, the quality of the material changes. This has an impact on our production process. These effects can also be simulated so that the purchasing agent can identify options for action in suitable time before problems arise in the production process. The shorter reaction time helps to prevent stock outs or production downtime,\" explained Materzok.The various scenarios and simulations can be saved in the Scenario Manager. From there, the purchasing agent can quickly and easily compare the current situation to various potential future scenarios. They can then react accordingly, helping bolster supply chain resilience.Another focus within the APS is on Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP). This module, which has over 70 users, is all about optimizing demand planning to supply customers. \"We map the planning perspective in Board,\"\u00a0explained Materzok. \"We create a forecast for customer demand. This planning forecast is then translated into the necessary production figures. Here, too, the day-to-day actuality ensures that we can react quickly.\"\u00a0\"In the next phase, we implemented several parallel projects on the Board platform. One of them is the forecast for inventory management. Board provides transparency into the process where products and elements of pre-production are currently located. This is then used for the stock forecast. For S&OP we have integrated an external AI module based on R to support the manual forecast. The module provides us with a statistical forecast that is getting better and better through machine learning,\" explained Materzok.\u00a0Customer benefits: Fast and informed decisionsConcentrate planning is extremely important for Aurubis' core metal smelting business. Board tracks when each individual ship arrives, with which concentrates, in which composition, and quality. This is highly complex for the various elements and is observed in various scenarios in Board. All the preparation is done in Board, where the data is processed. This is then passed on to the operational systems so that the operational planning for the furnaces can take place.\u00a0\"We had set ourselves three important goals at the beginning of the APS project: transparency, integration, and speed. We have come much closer to these goals with the introduction of Board,\" said Materzok with satisfaction.Creating a single, integrated process with Board allowed Aurubis to implement tactical supply chain planning across the entire Aurubis Group. All involved parties now have access to the same, secured data according to their respective rights. Dependencies became clear and collaboration has improved, helping optimize tactical planning processes.Transparency in supply chain management processes improved workflows and created clarity on how well the supply of the production processes is guaranteed. Purchasing managers receive important signals so that they may intervene in suitable time to increase the resilience of the supply chain.\u00a0\"In inventory planning, we now have transparency on a daily basis across all products, as we always see the current movement data. And with the planning data in the forecast, we can reliably look into the future to see when new raw materials and preliminary products will be available. We can control our inventory much better,\" explained Materzok.As a result, Aurubis has reduced inventories, which in turn has had a positive impact on liquidity and consolidated earnings.\u00a0\"Fast does not always automatically mean good,\" said Materzok. \"But with Board, we've managed to speed up planning while improving the quality of decisions because we now have access to sound data. The ability to simulate different scenarios also helps us to check the impact of each option in advance.\"\u00a0Additional use cases for the Board platform are expected in the coming months. Financial planning is not the only topic on the agenda; sustainability is increasingly becoming important at Aurubis. \"I can well imagine that we will also implement ESG reporting via the Board Platform,\u201d concluded Materzok."

In order to achieve this, Eisai was dealing with multiple sources of business data which were collated in spreadsheets and managed by the various departments to which they related. This unstructured approach made it impossible to obtain an accurate, unified view of\u00a0activity and KPIs across the business, and responding to requests for information from management or the company\u2019s HQ required time-consuming manual input.In addition to the Sales and Marketing reporting requirements, the Finance department identified the need for improvements in several budgeting, planning and forecasting processes, including the production and revision of Income Statements, which were also very time-consuming in nature. The final requirements came from the Logistics department, which required a more efficient way to monitor and plan the product distribution activity using data from the factory floor.\u00a0Selection ProcessAs Eisai\u2019s requirements extended beyond analysis into budgeting, planning and forecasting, a Business Intelligence (BI) tool alone was not enough to meet the requirements of the various departments.

With only one licence cost and no additional modules to purchase, it quickly became clear to Eisai that Board\u00a0could solve all of the company\u2019s requirements in a cost-effective manner.\u00a0The ProjectThe initial phase of the project focused on the requirements of the Sales and Marketing teams, building analyses for sales territories and market data by area, province, scientific medical informer and regional sales manager. For each reporting view, performances indicators (such as market share, growth, penetration etc.) were included to allow easy analysis against set targets and act as the basis for monthly HQ reporting. Analyses were also built to report on Salesforce activity (Eisai\u2019s CRM system) to look at activity volumes and effectiveness.The second phase of the implementation addressed the detailed needs of the Finance, Administration and Logistics departments.

Riri\u2019s mission is to be the preferred global supplier of zippers and buttons to the fashion and luxury accessories market.The Need: A medium-sized business with complex Financial Consolidation requirements\"Riri\", explains Cinzia Vernillo, Group Finance and Accounting Manager, \u201dis a medium-sized business that, from a Financial Consolidation standpoint, has a series of highly complex requirements. Alongside our strong presence in international markets, involving the use of four currencies, the company also needs to consolidate at various different levels and\u00a0separately analyze the results of our two principal lines of business: zippers and buttons.\"\u201cManaging such a complex consolidation process using basic Excel spreadsheets was becoming increasingly difficult and, with the greater challenges, my staff faced the very real possibility of making mistakes and, despite their best efforts, jeopardizing the validity of our data.\u201d\u201cDue to this, we decided to consider adopting specific consolidation software for our management and statutory reporting purposes and, with agreement from Francesco Milanesi, our Group IT Manager, we turned to Board. We were already satisfied users of Board\u00a0for operational reporting, so it seemed natural to adopt it in the FC area as well. In this way we could bring together on a single platform all our Business Intelligence and Performance Management activities - avoiding unnecessary duplications of costs and effort.\"The Project\"The Board\u00a0project began two years ago and has never ceased, constantly adapting with great flexibility to the dynamics of the Riri Group, in terms of the structural changes seen at corporate level and the evolution of our IT systems,\"\u00a0notes Cinzia. \"In particular, we are rolling out SAP internationally with timely changes to the Board\u00a0consolidation model and, at the same time, we are moving from Swiss C.O. to Swiss GAAP FER. This transition is obviously very delicate and the Board\u00a0solution enables us to tackle it in the best possible way.\"At present, Board\u00a0Financial Consolidation meets various functional requirements:Management of 4 currencies with 4 different consolidation levels, ensuring that the consolidation process complies with the legal requirements imposed by the current corporate structureAutomatic acquisition of data from the SAP and AS/400 business applicationsAutomatic reclassification to Group format of local charts of accounts, with the ability to view trial balances in their local formatMonthly income statements and quarterly balance sheetsSegmented reporting by line of businessDetailed schedules for the explanatory notesReclassified dual-currency Operational Income Statements and Balance Sheets with monthly and annual reporting\u00a0The Benefits\"The introduction of Board FC has enabled us to reduce drastically the time taken to generate consolidations, making the process more controllable and less prone to error. The greater security and improved usability of the solution has even allowed me to delegate management of the consolidation to others, thus creating organizational back-ups and avoiding bottlenecks in our accounting processes.In addition, the detailed schedules needed for the explanatory notes are essentially generated at zero cost, using the reports created by fully integrating the FC application with the native Business Intelligence functions offered by Board.In conclusion, I can say that Board\u00a0has enabled us to easily manage\u00a0a complex consolidation process, improving overall governance and reducing both the risks and the resources associated with using Excel.\""

        "title": "Unified Consolidation, Analysis, and Reporting at ImagineX",
        "company": "ImagineX",
        "content": "ImagineX is part of The Lane Crawford Joyce Group, a retail group that has been operating in Hong Kong for over 170 years. Having established a strong history in Asia, it is now the premier fashion retail, brand management, and distribution group across the China and South East Asia.The group operates as a holding company, while the company itself, through its subsidiaries, provides diverse and customized services for fashion, beauty, and lifestyle brands such as Kate Spade, Brooks Brothers, Salvatore Ferragamo, Tory Burch, Marc Jacobs, Aveda, Augustinus Bader, and more throughout Asia.The Challenge: Overcoming manual financial reporting processesFinance teams at ImagineX were spending large amounts of time compiling reports from disparate systems into outdated platforms. Financial reports were all in Excel format, requiring the accounting team to transfer data across spreadsheets, while Point of Sale (POS) data, from the sales team, existed in PDFs \u2013 necessitating further time-consuming data entry into spreadsheet-based reports.Heading up the digital transformation project to overcome these challenges, Gordon Chan \u2013 Senior Finance Manager, FP&A \u2013 discusses this point:\u201cOur existing financial reporting and consolidation process was very manual and cumbersome. All financial reports were in Excel format. Accounting teams spent countless hours compiling reports from one Excel to another. POS information was always static in PDF format and user-unfriendly. We had to pull data from two different systems, [Accounting and POS systems] which had no direct link, and consolidate it all in Excel manually. This resulted in time-consuming and inconsistent results.\u201dDesiring a more efficient financial reporting and consolidation process to overcome these challenges, ImagineX sought a solution that could:integrate data from sales and accounting teams into one consolidated financial reportenhance management P&L reporting and consolidation, including:eliminations and brand/group adjustmentssales & operational reporting and dashboardssales, operational, and financial planning processes (such as forecasting and budgeting)approval/rejection workflow processesmap the process linking sales and accounting teams\u2019 dataAfter considering several vendors, including IBM, FlexSystem (already the existing accounting system at ImagineX), and several local Hong Kong-based businesses, the Board decision-making platform was selected as the solution to deliver on the above. Combining Business Intelligence, planning, and predictive analytics in a single interface, Board would provide a single point of truth for ImagineX\u2019s finance activities in a flexible platform that could adapt with the business.Talking about why Board was selected over other vendors, Gordon states:\u201cThe following factors tilted us in favor of Board: an integrated, all-in-one solution for our decision-making needsflexibility and ease of usea proven track record and experience in the retail space, especially fashion and luxury retailthe Board team gave us the confidence during the pre-sales and sales engagements that they will cater to our business requirements.\u201dThe flexibility offered by Board was a particular advantage during the selection process. ImagineX were looking to start with a smaller idea and add new functionality and capability over time. This was something that other major providers were not able to do, instead adopting an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach, as Gordon astutely puts it. With Board, as was desired from the very beginning, ImagineX could put a phase-by-phase development plan in place, scaling up as needed.The Solution: A flexible, all-in-one platform to enhance decision-making across a fast-paced industryIn choosing Board, ImagineX has gained impactful, wide-scale benefits across its management reporting, dashboarding, financial consolidation, and planning processes, which have now been unified in a single, user-friendly platform.Taking full advantage of the Board team\u2019s expertise in retail, particularly, in this case, across fashion and luxury retail, the Board platform was swiftly implemented. ImagineX Group was able \u201cto quickly see the small steps of success,\u201d as Gordon highlights. He continues:\u201cThe flexibility and ease of use was critical to a fast-paced business like ours and that was most appealing, apart from being able to do both reporting and planning in the same solution. But most importantly, it is also critical that the solution can be deployed and implemented properly - the Board team gave us that confidence. They can deliver a solution and not just provide a product or tool.\u201dAs a result of the Board implementation, ImagineX\u2019s technology landscape has evolved significantly. In its legacy setup, the organization was operating with two core systems: FlexSystem for accounting and a POS system delivered through ChainStorePlus. Neither had any connectivity with the other, leaving the accounting and sales teams operating disparately. The only way to transfer data from either system was to enter it into Excel spreadsheets manually, a laborious and time-consuming challenge ultimately offering little-to-no extractable insight. With Board in place, these issues have been overcome entirely.ImagineX now benefits from a single version of the truth, with Board automatically pulling data from both the FlexSystem accounting system and the POS system into one location to provide near real time visibility of the business. Board allows intelligent mapping between the legacy systems to properly link financial and sales data in one consolidated report, enabling greater, cross-departmental insights to be uncovered through the comparison of information from different sources.\u201cSince the system\u2019s launch, our management has gained easy access to data and analyses that previously required manual compilation,\u201d highlights Gordon, in relation to the significant improvements in management information access that have been achieved.Interactive dashboards highlight key KPIs at a glance, making it easier for managers to understand the company\u2019s current position, while Board\u2019s self-service nature enables them to perform their own analyses, answering their own questions instantly.As the consolidation and intercompany elimination of financial data is managed automatically by Board, P&L accounts are now produced at the click of a button. This accurate view of the finances is also combined with sales and operational data on-demand, giving the management team complete transparency without having to rely on others to compile and present it. The ability to drill down to greater levels of detail instantly, if required, delivers further insights, enabling more-informed management decisions to be made in a faster timeframe.\u201cThe all-in-one approach of Board, combining management reporting, consolidation and planning [both Financial & Operational Planning], matches our vision of having an integrated platform for all our decision-making processes\u201d states Gordon.The Future for ImagineX: Taking Board to the next levelWith a significant improvement to financial and sales processes achieved, ImagineX is keen to maintain momentum on its digital transformation journey.\u201cThe initial goal was to build a system integrating financial and operational data into one online platform which management can easily access. This goal has been achieved and our management is interested in investing more into the system, even in this tough economic environment.\u201d says Gordon. \u201cThe digital transformation initiative is critical to our business as we move from old traditional methods to a more dynamic and digital era catering to our challenging and fast-growing organization.\u201dWith this in mind, the group has already launched plans to expand Board to incorporate:management consolidation: to automate the process of producing an accurate balance sheet in an easy-to-digest formatcash flow planning and reporting: to provide greater insights into sources of income and monitor the current cash flow positiondemand/merchandise planning: to balance supply and demand, ensuring overstock and stockouts are minimized\u201cWe are working towards ensuring all these systems and solutions work cohesively and seamlessly to provide us with a single version of truth,\u201d says Gordon.In a final comment, Gordon discusses what he would say to others who might be interested in investing in the Board solution:\u201cBoard has the perfect blend between solution and\u2026an experienced implementation team who can translate our requirements easily into the system. I would recommend the Board solution and we have already started mentioning it to our industry peers as well as our parent company, Lane Crawford Joyce group.\u00a0Board has always listened to our needs and requirements. Whenever we faced challenges, we have found someone at Board with innovative ideas to find a solution with us.\u201d"

        "company": "Bata",
        "content": "The ClientCompar S.p.A., based in Limena (Padua, Italy), is an Italian company in the international Bata Group and has been since 1931. Bolstered by a constant growth trend, Compar has managed to gain a leading position on the Italian domestic footwear and clothing market thanks to its sales structure, with a dense network of outlets all over Italy, now totaling more than 400.Its continuous expansion policy has been sustained by the doubling of sales volumes and the doubling of the number of people involved in the organization (about 350 employees) over the last five years.In regards to its sales structure, Compar has diversified its growth strategy by developing both direct sales and franchising channels. To be noted here is the constantly increasing size of the franchising channel (about 25%): this has led to an acceleration in business dynamics, in parallel with the greater organizational complexity involved in the management of an indirect channel. This dynamism is linked to the Compar value proposition, represented by the confirmation of the Bata brand in the context of customer fidelization based on the formulae offered in the group's different outlet chains: Bata City, Bata Superstore, Bata Factory Store, and, finally, Athletes World.The Bata City chain is characterized by prestige city locations with products in a higher price range. Bata Superstores focus on the bigger volumes generated by an across-the-board product range and locations in shopping malls. Bata Factory targets nuclear family customers with an economical product range. Finally, the Athletes World chain targets young customers receptive to the trends set by the major worldwide brands.The growing organizational complexity of Compar S.p.A. is linked also to its leading role within the Bata group. Bata is the biggest global footwear manufacturer and retailer and is present all over the world with a dense network of over 4,600 direct sales outlets and over 50,000 staff in more than 50 countries, serving more than a million customers a day.The NeedIn the context of an increasingly competitive market (due especially to the vitality of China and India) and rapidly evolving customer behavior patterns, the Bata management has singled out a series of priorities for effectively supporting the company's growth strategy.Translating strategic choices into operational terms and assessing how much the targets set by these choices are being achieved quantitatively and qualitatively suggests a rethinking of business planning and control methods in a context closely related to the actual processes. A decisive factor in this is the organizational impact, which is why the people and activities involved must be effectively coordinated and aligned in a common direction of development.Given the area that Compar operates in, the natural cornerstone of all this would seem to be the business process: what and how much to buy from suppliers, what times and criteria to apply when distributing the goods to the sales outlets with a view to meeting customers' needs in the most effective way and what policies to adopt to maximize sales in order to maintain a sufficiently high level of stock rotation. The process cuts across many company areas is characterized by a high degree of complexity and its component activities are highly asynchronous.In the light of these factors, the need arises to adopt models and technological tools capable of managing the process in its entirety: simulation on the basis of different hypotheses, planning according to multiple directives and at distinct moments, analyses of results obtained and related variances, sharing knowledge and coordinating the actions to be taken. All this must necessarily be integrated with the structure of the company management IT systems (these too, therefore, needing to be redesigned) without restricting operational capacity.The SolutionThe objective of the collaboration with SDG is to design and implement a new business planning model. Using a consolidated approach, the project team, made up of SDG consultants and the main process owners, concentrated its efforts in two directions.Analysis of process:Highlighting the classes of information involved in the planning, i.e. qualitatively and quantitatively identifying the single activities sales, procurement, and stock levels each in terms of quantity, value, and margin.Defining the levels of detail for structuring the information classes. The fashion industry, characterized by extremely rapidly evolving dynamics, demands a multiplicity of perspectives: not only the time, the merchandise category, the sales outlet, and the company but also the collection and the age of the goods, closely related to the sales potential. The philosophy underlying the choice of planning is based on the search for a benchmark somewhere between depth, accuracy, and simulation speed.Formally expressing the operational logics of the forecasting model: the numerical constituents of the model are organized to form a rational path that isolates the individual planning levers, so as to highlight the contribution in relation to the final result.Integration of model into company context:IT systems: the implementation of the model is based on the premise of the use of a suitable tool that must interact with company information flows. The efficient operation of the designed model is based on its capacity to acquire data, accurately and at the right times, from sources that are potentially heterogeneous and, in any event, not optimized in relation to these specific needs. In this specific case, a multi-dimensional platform (Board) has been chosen, with specially tailored input criteria for the management system database.Organization: the organizational impact of the increased complexity of the model is even more significant, in terms of the coordination of the different actors in the process. From this point of view, the analysis aims to balance the needs of the different users in order to make the individual contributions constructive.The model developed is divided up in a supply chain-oriented pattern, in which all the activities in the chain procurement, distribution, sale combine to generate the objectives of the planning itself.The planning of the turnover goals, the first step in the process, proceeds by means of two different strategies, aimed at balancing the mixture of past collections and new articles. In the first case, the performance achieved in previous periods sets a constraint in terms of available stock levels; furthermore, the sales potential decreases rapidly with the age of the merchandise. Using the lever of price cuts, the objective is to balance the need to reduce stock remainders against maintaining average profits. In the second case, the margins and the quantities sold are decided on the basis of the total turnover target. The quantities, values, and sales margins of the new merchandise determine the procurement budget and are therefore set with the involvement of the different buyers in the process.The link between procurements and sales is the distribution activity, which connects the different merchandise categories to the sales outlets. The objective is to maximize selling effectiveness, differentiating the goods according to the size, clientele, location, and status of the individual sales outlet.What is then planned for procurement and sales is the seasonality, taking into account the behavior patterns of customers and suppliers and setting the growth potential of the sales outlets and the positive sign of the sock remainders level as constraints.The multiplicity of the available scenarios and the elasticity of being able to select different levels of detail make it possible to modulate the speed and accuracy of results in relation to the period and the recipients of the planning process. The management and control system have the task of making an initial forecast, on the basis of medium-long term signs; working at a highly aggregated level of detail (macro-category, chain, collection) makes it possible to focus attention on overall company performance and get results quickly. The translation of these objectives into operational terms involves the people in charge of the single activities and areas and proceeds with the information gradually becoming more detailed (sub-category, sales outlet, collection, age of goods, week, etc.). The management budget and operational plan are integrated within the same model and are made available via a single platform. The planning output, in terms of classes of information and size/structure, can be compared to actual concrete results. The analysis of the differences makes it possible to revise previously made estimates on future occasions and take corrective measures. In the event of an excessively pessimistic margin forecast, for example, it is possible to act on the age composition of the goods rather than on the buying margin in order to align the objective with the result when revising. Making the planning levers explicit facilitates the process of singling out the effects on the end result.The ResultsThe adoption of an integrated business planning model has had an immediate effect on the way of running the company.The definition and control of the essential levers have made it possible to map out a logical path for the formation of the target data and for pointing out any discrepancies between the needs of the actors involved in the same activity (e.g. managers of different BUs), rather than between those involved in different activities (such as sales manager and procurement manager). The flexibility of being able to choose what level of detail to use in the planning has made it possible to obtain reliable results quickly, results that can be discussed and approved by management and refined in a subsequent revision. For the same reasons, including performance analysis, it is easier to identify the causes that have generated certain results and to take the appropriate measures.From the point of view of the basic control of the company, it should be stressed that the information output of the business planning, i.e. buying, sales, and stock remainders, constitutes the starting point for the economic-financial planning process, which can thus be developed on the basis of more reliable, shared results.Future DevelopmentsA number of different areas of development are defining themselves:The control structure: it is natural to think of the development of the economic-financial planning and reporting model as the next step after the business planning. The sales outlet, which is the basic profit center, becomes the main analysis subject and connects up immediately with the corresponding characteristic dimension of the business planning.Internationalization: the significant international presence of Compar makes the ability to extend business control models and tools to different situations a necessary condition. In particular, the introduction of the business planning model in the main foreign branches (carefully tailoring the degree of complexity to each individual situation) is a decisive push towards the sharing of objectives and the methods for translating them into business action."

        "company": "Kirin Group",
        "content": "Kirin Group is known for globally recognized products including KIRIN ICHIBAN and Kirin Gogo-no-Kocha. The enterprise has diversified its business to include a wide range of products, including health foods, supplements, and pharmaceuticals. The expansive group has more than 30,500 employees working across a portfolio of more than 170 companies. With a goal to innovate across the spectrum from food to medicine, it leverages strengths such as bio-fermentation technology to expand its business domains. Actively pursuing global expansion, its beverage business operates in Australia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America.Group Finance DX: The foundation for expansion and growthAligning shared values and long-term goals throughout the entire group was a significant challenge as Kirin aimed to grow. Understanding management plans and business company goals\u2014and keeping them in aligned to corporate plans and goals\u2014was a crucial step to ensure continued success in the organization.To achieve this goal, Kirin Group established a new FP&A team in its holding company and across its main business companies. Its name: Group Finance DX. While its primary business function was management accounting, the corporate finance and planning team can collaborate closely with each business company to monitor management plans and optimize investments and resource allocation for the entire group. To ensure precision and accuracy, business plans with real-time data are shared with each team.Kirin chooses Board to overcome the limitations of Excel managementKirin looked to create an FP&A process across the entire enterprise to manage long-term business plans more effectively. Previously, plans were created in Excel by multiple business companies before being analyzed and assessed at the corporate. As Rei Ishikawa, Financial Strategy Department (FP&A), recalls:Excel formats varied from one business company to another, making it challenging to compare and evaluate them side by side. Just aligning the formats was a laborious task.Cumbersome and manual work must be minimized to allocate more time for higher level analysis and collaboration among the business companies. Adding to this challenge, conducting simulations in Excel was not an easy process. Ishikawa notes:We needed to consider introducing a mechanism that allows for easy forecasting and visualization, like a dashboard.After thorough consideration, Kirin selected Board Intelligent Planning to integrate all functions necessary for planning, from data input and budget creation to analysis, simulation, and report generation.With each business company performing data input and budget creation on the same platform, there was no need for format standardization, resulting in significantly reduced manual work. Ishikawa notes:Adding scenarios is relatively easy, making simulation much more straightforward compared to Excel. Board also allows for easy forecasting from various perspectives.The 6-month challenge: Addressing individual requirements of six business companiesTo implement Board, Kirin consulted with NTT Data, a company with a wealth of support experience. The experts recommended Board for all FP&A needs including easier collaboration between corporate headquarters and six major business companies. They planned for a development period of six months and requested NTT Data to complete the project with a minimal budget.Yutaro Shimizu of NTT Data's Corporate Consulting & Marketing Division, reflects on this challenge:Even within Kirin Group, the six business companies have diverse business types, ranging from food and pharmaceuticals to health sciences.\u00a0We had to clear up the paradoxical task of introducing Board quickly, and on a budget, while addressing a variety of requirements.To overcome this challenge, NTT Data proposed designating one of the six business companies as the \u2018model company' to establish an effective template\u00a0through. The five remaining business companies could then extend this template within their own processes. Shimizu explains:Among the three main use cases for Board\u2014Profit & Loss (P&L), Balance Sheet (BS) and Cash Flow (CF)\u2014there aren't significant differences in BS and CF, even when the business types are different. By using the template we developed with the \u2018model company\u2019, and customizing only the P&L part to meet the requirements of each business company, we could meet the requirement of a quick implementation at minimal cost.One of the key benefits of Board was its ability to expand across departments. Ishikawa remarks:Besides having all the functions necessary for planning and monitoring, it is one of the few platforms that could be expanded to deploy across the entire group.Empowering a team of buildersTo accelerate implementation, while keeping down costs, NTT Data trained an internal team at Kirin with specific skillsets to allow them to customize templates on their own. This initiative was a welcome development, as Ishikawa explains:Of course, there is a cost-saving effect. But accumulating knowledge for development within the company also makes it easier to expand to new use cases in the future. We knew upskilling our team would be well worth the time and investment.Leading the implementation, Ishikawa was joined by four staff members from the DX Promotion Office. Having five full-time team members dedicated to the project helped ensure implementation was successfully rolled out in such a short period of time.In corporate DX projects, it is common to have employees work on a project alongside their regular duties,\u201d states Shimizu from NTT Data. \u201cHowever, dedicating full-time resources to this project increased the quality, reduced the need for revisions, and compressed the timeline and cost.Kirin also launched a financial modeling dashboard powered by Board. This eliminated the need for the corporate FP&A team to organize Excel files sent by each individual business company. They could now share plans using the same dashboard\u2014boosting collaboration among every business company. Yutaka Ogami, Deputy General Manager of the Finance Department at Kirin, concludes:In the future, we aim to visualize the management plans of even more business companies and strengthen group-wide monitoring and governance.\u00a0Our goal is for FP&A to contribute to the company's growth.Kirin's financial modeling dashboard on Board presents clear and easy-to-understand visualizations of various simulations, including revenue forecasts for different scenarios."

        "content": "Business ObjectivesReduce the effort\u00a0required to obtain a holistic view of the business, consolidate financial and operational information from all 20 operating entities plus numerous joint ventures, and enable self-sufficiency for analysis and reporting.The CompanyFounded in 1963, L&Q is a leading housing association in the UK and one of London's largest residential developers. Dedicated to building high-quality homes to meet a range of needs and incomes, L&Q also provides a number of other residential services including property management and investment within local communities.\u00a0As a non-profit organization, L&Q works alongside 90 local authorities to manage over 95,000 homes across London and the South East, providing\u00a0affordable rental accommodation and low-cost home ownership schemes.Business ChallengesL&Q has been working with Board since 2011, and has enhanced the solution to meet changing requirements. The initial scope of the project was driven by the need for an alternative method of collating information from its Finance, Housing Management, Maintenance Management, and HR systems to provide a corporate-wide overview of performance, which would, in turn,\u00a0reduce the risk element of managing this information.The existing process,\u00a0which involved the IT team\u00a0collating data from multiple networks of spreadsheets to produce monthly KPI report packs, was costly and prone to manual error, with the average pack taking a week and a half to produce.\u00a0The initial objective was to find a BI replacement for the existing solutions, in addition to removing\u00a0the reliance on the hundreds of spreadsheets being transferred from department to department, to give a real-time view of performance using interactive dashboards.Ian Webster, Finance Strategy Manager at L&Q explains:\u201cOur two key KPI report packs are produced monthly. The Executive Group and Board Pack, which is 20 pages long, includes measures such as growth and financial health (cost per unit, operating margins etc.), customer satisfaction, sales performance and handover stats relating to new builds. Our Operational pack, which is 45 pages long, contains a huge number of KPIs including turnover, rental incomes and arrears, repair\u00a0time and quality, estate quality gradings, and complaints. Both reports pull information from our finance, housing\u00a0and maintenance management systems, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and other sources such as customer surveys. The manual production of these collated reports was obviously extremely time-consuming.\u201dSelection ProcessRecognizing the need for a more efficient way of working and a futureproofed solution, L&Q used Gartner as a starting point for analyzing the available options. After a detailed comparison of the market, which included SAP BusinessObjects, Qlik,\u00a0and Microstrategy, L&Q invited several vendors to present their solutions, judging them based upon the speed at which the software could present the information back to the business and the ability to have sound governance of that information.As a non-profit organization in a recovering economic climate, L&Q needed to get the finance team to engage and buy into the project as a first initiative. The business didn\u2019t want to solve everything at once but wanted some quick wins in the early adoption stages.\u201cSome vendors suggested 18 months - 2 years in project build time because they weren\u2019t able to combine fast execution with enterprise capabilities,\u201d says Ian. \u201cBoard delivered a POC which showed speed of delivery and powerful functionality. The MS Office add-in also made a big impact in the selection process. Being able to provide that\u00a0familiar working environment,\u00a0along with the\u00a0clean look and feel of the solution, showed us that we could easily train and engage our teams in using the software. We decided to go directly\u00a0to the providers rather than use consultancies and that enabled us to build a relationship really quickly with the Board team, which has made a real difference to the running of the project.\u201dThe ProjectThe initial phase of the implementation was a success and has gone from strength to strength since then,\u00a0as Ian explains:\u201cOur IT team worked seamlessly with Board to get the project up and running very quickly. We\u2019ve done other system implementations and therefore we understood that the relationship is key to a successful implementation. It wasn\u2019t just the front of house people that sold the project to us, but the technical team behind the scenes.The implementation went very smoothly, with\u00a0the internal business case taking longer than the start of the deployment. The initial phase of the project took a couple of months to complete but we were able to use the software straight away and start thinking about our rollout plan. There are now trained teams, that didn\u2019t exist before, using Board on a day-to-day basis across the business. We focused initially on Maintenance as we spend over \u00a3150m a year keeping properties up to scratch and use a combination of in-house teams and external contractors, so monitoring and reviewing the performance to ensure we are keeping our spend in line is a key driver. However it is never a complete journey; the project has continued to grow as\u00a0we use Board across more and more areas of the business.\u201dBusiness BenefitsWith a growing presence across the business, L&Q now has 140 power users across different departments and over 600 concurrent lite+ users.\u00a0As a business with a strong learning culture, its employees have enjoyed exploring the software. Having used Board now for several years, L&Q is realizing numerous business benefits.\u201cThe monthly Executive and Operational report packs which used to take weeks to manually collate are now produced in PowerPoint using Board's Microsoft Office plug-in, which means a single click refreshes the entire dataset,\u201d says Ian. \u201cThis is obviously a huge time-saver. We also now consolidate financials from 20 operating entities using Board, making it easy to produce financial statements and notes, and all of our stock grading is now done in Board too, fed by data from Keystone. This allows us to understand cashflow and maintenance capital costs per unit or per scheme over 30 years with ease.\"L&Q uses this forecast to regularly review its 95,000 properties, looking at the bottom 5% and taking timely decisions on their future.\u00a0The self-sufficiency to query any data across the business is another key benefit, which has reduced reliance on the IT department, removed the time wasted on phone calls by finance business partners relating to data queries and ensures the latest information is always in use. The performance management team, which previously had to submit data queries to find the detailed information needed for their internal presentations, can now use Board's easy drag-and-drop interface to build interactive dashboards to transform data into information instantly. Similar benefits can be found in the Anti-Social Behavior team, which\u00a0monitors resident behavior, and the Complaints team which\u00a0analyzes\u00a0the maintenance team\u2019s performance.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve also got a big focus on the building of new homes, working with contractors and other housing associations on joint ventures and sharing our finances and development experience,\u201d continues Ian. \u201cWe currently build 2,500 new homes a year with a view to increasing this to 10,000 in the near future, and Board's interactive dashboards will be helping us measure key KPIs against these developments such as costs, completion and handover rates, and defects, in real-time.\u201dIan\u2019s advice to others is to understand where internal engagement is needed to start the adoption process before looking into the vendor selection process. In doing this, L&Q identified the needs and wants of the whole business from a department-up as well as an enterprise-wide view, ensuring a smooth implementation and software adoption across all users."

        "content": "The ClientCompar S.p.A., based in Limena (Padua, Italy), is an Italian company in the international Bata Group and has been since 1931. Bolstered by a constant growth trend, Compar has managed to gain a leading position on the Italian domestic footwear and clothing market thanks to its sales structure, with a dense network of outlets all over Italy, now totaling more than 400.Its continuous expansion policy has been sustained by the doubling of sales volumes and the doubling of the number of people involved in the organization (about 350 employees) over the last five years.In regards to its sales structure, Compar has diversified its growth strategy by developing both direct sales and franchising channels. To be noted here is the constantly increasing size of the franchising channel (about 25%): this has led to an acceleration in business dynamics, in parallel with the greater organizational complexity involved in the management of an indirect channel. This dynamism is linked to the Compar value proposition, represented by the confirmation of the Bata brand in the context of customer fidelization based on the formulae offered in the group's different outlet chains: Bata City, Bata Superstore, Bata Factory Store, and, finally, Athletes World.The Bata City chain is characterized by prestige city locations with products in a higher price range. Bata Superstores focus on the bigger volumes generated by an across-the-board product range and locations in shopping malls. Bata Factory targets nuclear family customers with an economical product range. Finally, the Athletes World chain targets young customers receptive to the trends set by the major worldwide brands.The growing organizational complexity of Compar S.p.A. is linked also to its leading role within the Bata group. Bata is the biggest global footwear manufacturer and retailer and is present all over the world with a dense network of over 4,600 direct sales outlets and over 50,000 staff in more than 50 countries, serving more than a million customers a day.The NeedIn the context of an increasingly competitive market (due especially to the vitality of China and India) and rapidly evolving customer behavior patterns, the Bata management has singled out a series of priorities for effectively supporting the company's growth strategy.Translating strategic choices into operational terms and assessing how much the targets set by these choices are being achieved quantitatively and qualitatively suggests a rethinking of business planning and control methods in a context closely related to the actual processes. A decisive factor in this is the organizational impact, which is why the people and activities involved must be effectively coordinated and aligned in a common direction of development.Given the area that Compar operates in, the natural cornerstone of all this would seem to be the business process: what and how much to buy from suppliers, what times and criteria to apply when distributing the goods to the sales outlets with a view to meeting customers' needs in the most effective way and what policies to adopt to maximize sales in order to maintain a sufficiently high level of stock rotation. The process cuts across many company areas is characterized by a high degree of complexity and its component activities are highly asynchronous.In the light of these factors, the need arises to adopt models and technological tools capable of managing the process in its entirety: simulation on the basis of different hypotheses, planning according to multiple directives and at distinct moments, analyses of results obtained and related variances, sharing knowledge and coordinating the actions to be taken.

        "content": "The CompanyFounded in 1813, Harvey Nichols is a high fashion retailer, focusing on branded merchandise and quality food and restaurant offerings. With a staff of 3,000, Harvey Nichols is a leading retailer in the UK and Ireland.The ChallengeIn the fast-moving retail environment, consistent, trustworthy, and easily accessible information is key to understanding the needs of both the customer and the business. Harvey Nichols realized it needed to implement a sound framework that would support its changing requirements as growth continued.It was essential to provide a more harmonized approach to Performance Management\u00a0that was more accurate, easier to use, and more cost-effective. Martin Schofield, Retail Operations Director, explains:\"Our existing reporting wasn't cohesive or reliable and was produced by a myriad of different tools. Users were not confident in the accuracy or reliability of the data.\u00a0Board has allowed us to consolidate our information into a single, integrated solution and displace multiple systems - Hyperion (Financial Reporting), Business Objects (Sales Reporting and Analytics), Arthur Planning, and a multitude of spreadsheets - giving the users much more faith in the results.\"The Selection ProcessBoard's Business Partner Retail Assist was already a trusted supplier of Harvey Nichols with the Merret supply chain ERP solution. With a pilot, completed utilizing Merret BI powered by Board (an out-of-the-box solution with retail-ready\u00a0reports based on the Board solution), the comparison to the existing platforms was carried out. Board was the clear winner.Alistair McDonald, Senior Business Systems Manager says:\"The pilot, replicating the sales reports produced in Business Objects, was completed in a matter of days. It was clear to us that Board would provide us with the single integrated environment that we wanted.\"The SolutionHarvey Nichols identified several areas which Board would address:More accurate, harmonized reportingIntegration of data from multiple sourcesReplace\u00a0several existing BI systems with one - BoardBudgeting/ForecastingEasier, more timely ad-hoc reportingSelf Service BIData ConsistencyPreviously the myriad of solutions and their disconnected approach led to a multitude of spreadsheets and different departments constructing their reports in different ways, thus data consistency was poor and confidence in the information being accurate was low. Control was also difficult and too loose.\u00a0The Board solution has allowed Harvey Nichols to eliminate this disconnect by providing a consistent framework and a solid foundation\u00a0from which to deliver a wide range of Performance Management applications.\u00a0Board's programming-free approach has allowed users to become self-sufficient. Ad-hoc reporting has become much simpler and quicker and the vastly improved data integration has instilled confidence in the accuracy of the information. Data consistency and the provision of a single version of the truth has encouraged users to delve deeper into the underlying data.\u00a0\"There is a greater thirst for the information on which to base sound decisions, which can only be healthy for the business,\" says Martin.The Board process began some 12 months ago and has delivered significant improvements to Daily Sales, Stock, and Financial Reporting as well as Cost and Sales Forecasting.The Daily Sales database and reports were the first to be built in Board, replacing Hyperion.\u00a0Data is loaded at the lowest level, allowing Harvey Nichols to analyze daily information by the SKU, till, day, hour, payment type, and operator (cashier). Aggregated data also allows analysis by Style, Colour, Size, Fit, customized product attributes, and standard attributes (sub-section section, category, and department).The Daily Sales application was rolled out to users across the business (merchandisers, finance, operations,\u00a0sales, etc.) who, with some basic training, can use the drill anywhere functionalities to perform on the fly, ad-hoc, root cause analysis, relieving a massive amount of pressure on IT and in turn saving time and money.The next step was to replace the weekly sales reporting previously produced in Business Objects which has also been successfully completed along with Cost and Sales Forecasting, replacing 100s of spreadsheets. Utilizing the workflow functionality in Board has not only automated the process but has introduced an element of control not previously available to Harvey Nichols.\"Even those users wedded to spreadsheets are happy to work with Board, thanks to its ease of use,\"\u00a0says Alistair.\"We have now rolled out financial reporting and sales and stock reporting across the business, making Hyperion redundant and phasing out Business Objects. We have just completed work on cost and sales forecasting in Board, which replaces hundreds of manual spreadsheets, and our main project on Board next year is to create a WSSI.\u00a0Board has given us a single application that has simplified and fully integrated our MIS reporting and planning. We are able to quickly produce ad-hoc reports, giving both head office and stores much greater visibility of our KPIs.\"Business BenefitsHarvey Nichols is reaping significant business benefits:System Enhancements\u00a0Monday mornings, a critical time in any retail organization, used to see systems grinding to a halt, purely because of running reports. Thanks to Board this is no longer an issue.Data Consistency and easier Ad-Hoc ReportingThe huge pressure put on the IT department by the business to provide ad-hoc reports/analysis and to answer a barrage of questions about the accuracy, consistency, and usefulness of the data has virtually disappeared, freeing up time to concentrate on delivering further projects and enhancements.Improved PerformanceThe biggest single win is highlighted best in improved performance. Business Objects reports used to take anywhere between 30-60 minutes to run. Board allows those same reports to be produced virtually instantaneously.\"Users are now able to have the data that they require at their fingertips, allowing them to concentrate on the analysis they should be doing, rather than sitting around waiting for the reports to be produced. The time/cost benefit to the business is significant and as we discover more ways of utilizing Board that can only grow,\" says Martin.Replacement of Business Objects, Hyperion, and Arthur PlanningMartin continues:\"The new solution is easier to implement and easier to use. User requests can be actioned in hours, not days. Our reporting is now more accurate and, as we have only one licence to pay, it is more cost-effective. With the Board BI framework in place, we can build in enhancements that will support our business expansion.\"Future PlansHarvey Nichols has several plans in the pipeline.Introduction of the WSSI (Weekly Sales, Stock, and Intake)More customer information to storesPush information to handheld devicesIntegration of further data sources\"The more we use Board, the more uses we can see for it,\" comments Alastair.\u00a0Martin concludes:\"We have achieved a lot in the first 12 months, but there is a lot more to come.\u00a0We have made a great start with a product that we believe can do the job we want it to and both the processes and relationships with Retail Assist and Board have been extremely positive. We like to choose suppliers that we want to work with and have confidence in, not necessarily the ones that have the most technologically advanced solutions, and in this case we appear and hope to have achieved both.\"Implementation PartnerRetail Assist was Board's partner of choice on this project. Its retail sector knowledge and competencies proved invaluable in providing some out of the box, retail-ready reports that were essential to Harvey Nichols. The mix of support from both Retail Assist and Board has enabled Harvey Nichols to leverage the solution in the most effective way."

        "content": "The CompanyThe Hanover-based Robinson Club GmbH, a member of the TUI Group, is Germany's\u00a0market leader in the premium segment for club-based vacations. At the present time, its portfolio includes 23 Club facilities and one townhouse, spread across eleven countries with a total bednight capacity of 12,600.About 40 years ago, Robinson laid the foundation for an entirely new kind of vacation: a quality offering that placed much greater emphasis on the individuality of its guests. By pursuing a consistent brand strategy and through continuous quality improvement, Robinson has exerted a decisive influence on the concept of club-based holidays and has secured itself a substantial competitive edge over all the other providers in this field.\u00a0The ChallengeIn the context of introducing new hotel software and through a rolling programme of upgrades to the full extent of IT systems, a need arose to optimize the entire range of planning and reporting processes. Core elements in this optimization process included a clear definition of the information required, and the procurement of a technology platform capable on the one hand of conducting flexible, multidimensional OLAP analyses and, on the other hand, of delivering standard reporting facilities.Alongside pure analysis work, the platform needed to be configured in such a way as to provide effective support to the optimized planning processes and functions. The previous planning and reporting system was characterized by the need for a high level of data collation and pre-processing. SDG consulting AG, a long-term partner of Board, was on hand to assist the company with the implementation of the project.\u00a0\u00a0The Board Solution\u00a0The first step towards optimization was to conduct a detailed analysis. Once all relevant reports had been assembled from the departments involved, together with a distribution address lists and frequency of report generation, the project team was able to categorize the full range of reports. With these systematically processed blocks of information, it was then possible to run workshops with the departments involved. During these workshops the characteristics and parameters required were identified, and the dimensions required to accommodate these factors decided upon. This process culminated in the design of a multidimensional data model, which enabled all relevant data to be obtained.The information gathered from the various different source systems soon made it clear that all the data needed to be collated and pre-processed in a central data warehouse (DWH). The structure for this DWH was implemented on an MS SQL server platform and the data from the various different source systems is now updated each night with the help of SSIS packages (SQL Server Integration Services). Thereafter, the data is consolidated and checked in accordance with defined routines. The outcome of this nightly update is a consistent set of data for use by Board's multidimensional analysis and planning tool.Using this solution, the various departments involved are able to analyze their most critical data, sourced from various dimensions, and can do so quickly. This includes, for example, the number of bednights, and the associated room utilization levels (single occupancy in double rooms etc.) in each Club, room category, and the latest booking status. All this information can be layered in other dimensions, e.g. the bookings channel or guest demographics, using a drill-down feature involving just a few clicks of the mouse. This completely eliminates the manual operation of processing data, and standard reports can be distributed automatically with the help of a report enrolment facility. This enables all users to obtain the specific information they require for their daily work, and to do so faster and more reliably.\u00a0Customer BenefitsAn enhanced level of transparency with utilization analyses has been achieved by simplifying the reporting process. This has substantially reduced the resource required to pre-process data. Moreover, multidimensional analyses are now much easier to cover from all defined levels and are very easy to implement.During the implementation of the reporting process, due account was taken of the future need to use the Board product\u00a0for the analysis of planning data.\u00a0\u00a0"

        "company": "SPL Tele",
        "content": "The company: A family business operating as a full-service provider in telecommunications\u00a0\u00a0SPL TELE is a family business with 450 employees. Since spinning off from Siemens AG in 2003, SPL TELE has seen steady development as a full-service provider of telecommunications infrastructures for mobile and fixed networks. The company is a respected and reliable partner for network operators, both in terms of network renewal and maintenance. SPL TELE is already the market leader in Austria and is expanding in Germany. The portfolio also includes services in the non-telco area, logistics and transport solutions, e-mobility, and customized products and tools. \u00a0SPL TELE also develops and markets the \"Rimo - Gives Control\" software. Rimo has two primary functions:\u00a0Projectplus supports planning, control, and monitoring of projects as a fully integrated solution across all company processes\u00a0Cableplus supports the management, planning, and expansion of passive networks.\u00a0The challenge: Analyzing growing volumes of data is time-consuming and inflexible\u00a0SPL TELE was looking for a solution that would make reporting, planning, and analysis much easier, more flexible, and faster for the company. Until then, it had been using Excel to create evaluations and reports. The volume of data to be analyzed was significant: \u00a0Approx. 400,000 time entries p.a.\u00a0800 projects\u00a0100,000 individual orders\u00a0500,000 goods movements p.a. \u00a0Complexity continued to increase due to the large number of projects involving 60 employees, six dimensions, two planning versions, and the constant use of two systems (ERP and the planning environment). Data entry and consolidation were already challenging and error-prone. Florian Sch\u00fctz, CEO of SPL TELE explains:The preparation of the data was extremely time-consuming for us and the performance of the evaluations was not satisfactory. Joint evaluations of technical data from our Rimo system and commercial data from the ERP were not possible at all.A similar picture emerged when it came to reporting.We had to struggle with a high time investment and correspondingly high costs in order to create fairly rigid reports in the end.In addition, an outdated tool was in use for planning, which increasingly proved to be inflexible and unable to meet modern requirements. \u00a0The goal was to find a solution that would enable a high level of agility in planning and analysis so employees can work together on a unified system based on workflow. This will make the flow of information faster and the processes more transparent. Florian Sch\u00fctz notes:We had in mind a tool that would significantly reduce the time required for planning and reporting through targeted process control. We wanted to use the time thus gained for things for which there was no time before. This is an important point, especially for fast-growing companies like ours, in order to be able to develop the company strategically. In addition, we want to switch our planning to rolling forecasts.\u00a0A very special aspect was added for SPL TELE. Rimo is SPL\u2019s own software platform for supporting project management processes and the operation of passive networks and offers (such as network planning, ticket and incident management, dispatching, orders, and order processing). Rimo required an appropriate Business Intelligence integration to offer process support and analysis functionality for customers.\u00a0The solution: A flexible platform for integrated planning and reporting, and a working partnership\u00a0Considering the given requirements, selecting the right solution was challenging. Gunter Leher, Head of Rimo Systems, explains:It was not just a matter of selecting a system that would cover the complex requirements at our company. Our goal was also to enter into a partnership with the supplier and to further market the solution. Therefore, it was not only the product that was important, but also the modalities of the partnership.As a customer, it is crucial for us to have a flexible product where we do not always have to rely on external consultants when we want to make a small change. As a partner, we put a lot of emphasis on the design of the partnership, with training, support and a joint concept for the future.After a convincing proof of concept, the choice was made for Board. Gunter recalls:We realized that it was not only the product that was right, but also the way we worked together.SPL TELE had set itself a tight schedule for the project. From the start, the project team implemented the interaction with Rimo and was able to perform initial analyses that were not possible before. Next came integration with the ERP system so the finance department can perform new and detailed commercial analyses. This also formed the basis for integrated group planning and controlling, a real milestone in the SPL TELE Group. David Planner, CDO at SPL TELE explains:We can now map complete actual reporting in Finance and Controlling, including variance analyses for individual projects and cost centers. This enables us to provide our management with important information for corporate control.Another important area for SPL was project reporting with bottom-up planning. Andreas Sauer, Senior Board Consultant at SPL TELE reports:This is really a broad field. It starts with time management and hourly evaluations on projects and employees and ends with complex project reporting with the evaluation and presentation of important KPIs such as booked times, material, external services, milestone progress, or revenue monitoring.Another critical development for SPL was 'commercial project closing'. Sandra Stoll, Division Manager Finance and Accounting at SPL TELE notes:Here, we consolidate and evaluate approximately 800 projects from a commercial perspective monthly. In doing so, we bring together data from the various data sources on the Board platform to analyze it. There's a very complex logic behind it. In addition, these values are generated in closing bookings, which are then transferred automatically from Board to our financial accounting system BMD. This application offers really great leverage and brings us added value and time savings.But SPL TELE doesn't just use Board to develop solutions for its own challenges. Gunter Leher explains:Why not offer your customers a product that we use ourselves and are convinced of? Our existing customers already using the Rimo software often ask for ways to extend their use with BI functions. With Board, we have the perfect add-on for Rimo.The high demand for BI solutions that support the digitalization and agility of companies has prompted SPL TELE to market the Board platform independently of Rimo as a stand-alone solution. As a result, the company is tapping into new customer groups.\u00a0Customer benefits: More time and resources for important tasksBoard's Intelligent Planning Plaftorm provides cost savings that would have otherwise been incurred for separate products and projects. It also avoids the issues linked to isolated solutions. Florian Sch\u00fctz comments happily:We now have a platform that is available to employees and allows extensive analyses without performance difficulties. Each department gets the information that is important to them at the right time. This gives employees an overview of the current situation and enables them to make better decisions. The extensive authorization concept in Board ensures that each person or department only sees the information that is of interest to them.The Board platform consolidates data in one place. This single point of truth solves many problems that SPL TELE had to deal with in the past. Complex data preparation only needs to be defined once and does not have to be periodically repeated over and over. All departments now work on a common, valid database. David Planner explains:Activities, especially for daily report preparation, are now automated. Manual intervention in the daily preparation is no longer necessary. We now use this time for more important things. By defining KPIs and targeted analyses, we can now better monitor and steer processes. In addition, management gets important data to make the decisions that control and develop the company further.Florian Sch\u00fctz concludes:We are currently introducing rolling forecasting. Board creates the conditions for implementing this quickly and massively accelerating the forecasting process."

        "title": "Unified Reporting, Merchandise Financial Planning, and Assortment Planning at Takko Fashion",
        "company": "Takko Fashion",
        "content": "Takko Fashion offers casual fashion for the whole family. The company sees itself as a multi-channel, smart discount retailer, and lets its customers decide for themselves how, where, and when to buy their fashion. With more than 1,900 stores in 17 countries and close to 18,000 employees worldwide, Takko Fashion is one of the largest fashion discount stores in Europe. With a wide variety of products and strong own brands, Takko Fashion capitalizes on an unlimited shopping experience in the multi-channel world of retail.The Challenge: Reducing manual efforts across planning processesTo stay on course for growth in the fashion market, you need an efficient merchandise planning system on top of a lucrative multi-channel business. This is where Takko Fashion saw the potential for improvement; by alleviating extensive manual efforts that went into its planning activities. Because Takko Fashion did not want to completely abandon its specific planning processes, the business looked for a new tool that would integrate planning, analysis, and reporting into a single platform and be flexible enough to map internal business processes in the best way possible.In the past, Takko fostered a planning landscape that became less and less consistent as the company steadily grew. This resulted in increased manual workload to try and keep the Management Summary Board free from errors. Bernhard Westphal, Senior Director Planning & Allocation at Takko Fashion, explains:Especially because of the ever-increasing volume of data, our system was pushed to its limits. Even planning our product ranges, which cover several thousand items, became nothing short of confusing and made the system more susceptible to errors.The new tool had to adapt as flexibly as possible to the planning processes at Takko Fashion, and not the other way around. Bernhard adds:We soon realized that we had very high expectations from our choice of software. The tool had to help us plan our merchandise consistently, with a single point-of-truth and with a uniform look and feel, providing analysis and reporting capabilities while being flexible enough for us to map our specific processes in the best way possible.The Solution: Consistent merchandise planningTo get as detailed an overview as possible of the tools in question, Takko Fashion invited various providers and consulting companies to a number of PoCs (Proof of Concepts), including to map Takko's own module logic, to come up with an automated distribution solution, and a solution to calculate batch quantities for its stores. Bernhard summarises this journey:In the PoCs, celver AG together with the Board Intelligent Planning Platform stood out the most. This was because celver's planning experts fully understand the fashion and retail industry and because they convinced us, as customers, that with Board they could develop a solution that would take into account our specific merchandise planning requirements.Takko Fashion and celver started implementing the Merchandise Financial Planning solution (MFP) and within three months the merchandise planning system went live. It covers sales, goods-in, stock, and margin planning, with a rolling forecast of more than 50 sometimes highly complex key figures. Bernhard says:It was amazing how quickly celver AG implemented the Board solution, working very closely with us. We had very special requirements for the MFP solution and to be honest, we were surprised that we could plan the next season already with the new tool.\u00a0The MFP project was seamlessly followed by the implementation of the Assortment Planning solution, which has a direct interface to the product and order management system.It was important to us from the very beginning not only to have a stand-alone planning solution, but also to have an interface to the operative system, so that we can use Board to both view the schedule and to analyze the current actual figures. It means we can use just one system for target/actual comparison. Many vendors offer simple planning solutions, but few systems let us see 'where we actually are, what we planned, and what are we planning to do'. We're really making progress in our assortment planning, especially with the features in Board like 'what's hot / what's not' charts and What-If? analyses, as well as OTB management.The Benefits: Reduced workload and greater agilityAs well as higher data quality and data consistency, with 100 users now signed up to the Board solution, Takko Fashion also promises more agility and less workload for all those involved.\"We used to use three different systems just for assortment planning. Now it all happens in one system,\" says Bernhard.A delighted Beate D\u00f6ker, Head of IT for the project, adds:With its open architecture, the Board solution integrates perfectly into the overall application landscape at Takko. And working with celver in this very diverse system environment has been straightforward and professional from day one. Several complex sub-projects had to be synchronized with our original data warehouse and the connected product and order management system. From the very beginning, the working relationship was well-structured and cooperative.Reduced susceptibility to errors due to a single point-of-truth, increased automation with integrated workflow control, and more detailed planning and simulations are just some of the benefits and the reasons why the Board solution fully met the expectations of Takko Fashion."

        "company": "Lufthansa City Center",
        "content": "Lufthansa City Center (LCC) is a franchise made up of Lufthansa City Center Reiseb\u00fcropartner GmbH (LCR) and Lufthansa City Center International GmbH (LCCI), which takes care of the international side of the business. The franchise chain was borne out of the Lufthansa city offices, whose first branch opened in Dresden in 1991. Deutsche Lufthansa AG founded LCR in 1994. In 2000, the travel agency partner took over all aspects of their franchise system and all the partners are now shareholders in the group.LCC currently manages 570 travel agency branches; 300 in Germany and 270 in 90 countries across every continent. 2,400 employees in Germany and 2,900 worldwide generated around \u20ac3.6 billion of business around the globe.The Challenge: Updating planning and forecasting modelsLCC wanted to rebuild its monthly reporting system. Before now, budget planning and forecasting were done with Excel, and connecting multiple files to different sub-plans became increasingly difficult. A big challenge was the constantly growing file sizes and the issue of broken links. What\u2019s more, the Excel-based solution did not include the option to drill down from the total values (e.g. the total travel expenses of one cost center) to the items posted beneath it.As there was no approval system, only Controlling could update the planning files. The actual values from Accounting also had to be updated manually.The new system had to map workflows and statuses for planning and forecasting and help establish a comprehensive financial schedule for the following year by taking the separate plans from various cost centers and adding them to the annual forecast. During the course of the year, LCC wanted to create a monthly forecast, including a deviation analysis and commentary function, both on a cost center basis and across companies.It was also important for the cost center managers to be able to make target/actual comparisons of items at any time, analyze any anomalies, and adjust the individual values of their cost center. This also had to be accompanied by a comparison of the year\u2019s accrued cost and revenue items with the planned values for the full year.Further requirements included a detailed plan of staffing costs and the creation of new planning projects, with the option to apply these to actual projects later on.The Board Solution: Fast implementation and no-programming requirementsAfter LCC assessed various vendors, the decision was made to choose Board. The decisive factor was the chance to design the system individually according to LCC\u2019s ideas with its no-programming approach, so the requirements of the specialist departments could quickly and easily be implemented. Steffen Losensky, Controlling Manager at Lufthansa City Center Reiseb\u00fcropartner GmbH, explains:The extensive examination of our requirements, and the positive support provided by Board partner XAX, also played an important role in us choosing Board.Board is set up to automatically import accounting data from upstream systems like SAP or Access. Cost center managers can also enter planning and forecast values in DataViews. You can plan staffing costs by month, for example, including all salary components, and then compare the planned values with the actual values.Cost center managers and Controlling can view all cost and revenue items at any time and update them where necessary. The cost and revenue items accrued during the year are compared with the planned values for the full year, supported by an internal extrapolation function. For this purpose, Board takes into account the previous actual values as well as the forecast values for the year's remaining months.As a Power User and Administrator, Steffen can set up intuitive screens for employees with very little effort. This reduces the training requirements for users from Controlling and specialist departments, which has a very positive effect on the Total Costs of Ownership (TCO).The Benefits: Reducing manual tasks and enhancing analysisThe Board platform makes it easier to create dashboards and summary reports. It reduces the manual effort required for monthly reporting, planning preparation, and merging planning and accounting data. This significantly reduces the time required to prepare planning and forecasting templates.Instead of dealing with technical questions about the system, those responsible now have more time to deal with the figures themselves. As a result, you have a faster, more targeted planning process and a more accurate and transparent planning system. Automatic data imports give managers a better and, above all, up-to-date overview of the economic growth of the company. With a higher level of detail in the anomaly analysis, management can identify critical developments more quickly and take the necessary measures.Steffen sums up the advantages:Working with Board brings us the data faster and more clearly, so we can then make decisions in a more agile and reliable way. You can clearly see, for example, where revenue is missing compared to the planned figures, or when a project incurs excessively high costs. Board provides a central overview for all cost and revenue items."

        "content": "Founded in 2001, INNOTECH\u00ae Arbeitsschutz is a family-owned company with headquarters in Kirchham, Austria and branch offices in Germany and Switzerland. From the onset, the company has placed great value in innovative, customized solutions. With a dedicated research and development team, INNOTECH\u00ae has set international standards in occupational safety and driven further developments in innovative products. Today, INNOTECH is one of the largest manufacturers in Europe, specializing exclusively in the production of safety systems, with 88% from its own manufacture, to guarantee maximum quality.\u00a0Challenge: Moving forward with a sustainable planning modelINNOTECH, like many young, successful, and fast-growing companies, found itself needing to modernize to meet increasing demands amidst an unsustainable Excel and Qlikview budgeting process. Andreas Sperl, Chief Financial Officer at INNOTECH, reports:\"The only values available were basic actual and planned figures as well as sales figures on an item basis from cost accounting. Other than that, we were able to have specific figures pulled via IT as needed. However, this procedure was not standardized and correspondingly laborious. In addition, there were different sources and thus different figures. The planning accuracy was accordingly not satisfactory. We really needed to take action, to realign ourselves in our planning.\"Solution: Single point of truth and planning across the entire product life cycleINNOTECH compared several software vendors via a proof-of-concept. In the process, Board convinced the team at INNOTECH with its technically mature solution that brought together all data. Andreas Sperl explains:\"Above all, the user-friendliness stood out with Board compared to the other systems. This is very important so that everyone involved can gain confidence in the solution and employees from all areas can be convinced to also work intensively with the system.\"Working with SPL Tele, an experienced Board partner with the trust of INNOTECH's key stakeholders, the project commenced. In just two months, the actual figures and the sales figures were transferred to Board, and after just shy of five months, the first sales planning could be implemented. Andreas Sperl recalls:\"The biggest effort here was cleaning up the master data. We hadn't looked at it in its entirety beforehand, so we had to keep checking and adjusting the data. Since Board is supposed to be our single point of truth, it was important we didn't release the figures until we were sure they were correct. This is the only way we can build trust in the system among employees. If there were any past discussions about which numbers were the right ones, it's now clear that the correct numbers today are the numbers from Board.\"With Board, several areas where data can be standardized includes:Data transferred from ABAS (the ERP system) to BoardData imported from Excel-based programs, such as the payroll programOther key sources such as Salesforce and Google programs like Google SurveysFuture plans to integrate HubSpot are also planned. INNOTECH has now built numerous applications for integrated business planning. These include:Cost center planningSales planningInvestment planning incl. automatic depreciation calculationStaff and training planningProfit & loss analysisStaff analysesProduction cost planning and production cost reportingWarehouse analysisGeo-dashboardingDespite an already extensive list of applications, Andreas Sperl has even more plans with Board:\u00a0\"On the one hand, I would like to bring the strategy even deeper into the cost center view. Likewise, production controlling is extremely important for us as a manufacturing company. Among other things, we would like to read out confirmation times or calculate setup costs. The topic of supply chain is also on the agenda. It\u2019s important to involve the entire company and to include all departments. The closer the departments are to the topic, the better we can specify the requirements. And I have the impression that with Board, everything is possible. So far, we haven't had any limitations in modeling, data structuring, or merging the data.\"This enables INNOTECH to cover the entire product lifecycle in planning, from purchasing and marketing to production and delivery.Benefits: Reliable data from planning to productionWith the reliable single point of truth, INNOTECH has laid the foundation to efficiently use its data for planning, analysis and reporting, and to steer the company based on data. Department managers can now calculate their specific key figures and aggregate data on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Product managers can run analyses at product group or item level, and can calculate and compare production costs. Andreas Sperl adds:\"We have created the basis so employees can work with the data. It's a process that takes some time for everyone to understand just what they can do with the numbers. More and more, employees have Board open by default when they come into the office. The user-friendliness of Board naturally helps to make it easier to work with the data.\u201dAndreas Sperl continues, talking about a special project:\u00a0\"What impressed me most in planning was the possibility of extrapolating the quantities of produced items with average prices from sales planning. SPL Tele has additionally created an application in Board that breaks down the various items we produce to each part. In this way, the production manager and the purchasing department can quickly and easily obtain information about which individual parts are needed and how often in the various articles. This information is extremely helpful when ordering and in discussions with suppliers about good purchasing conditions.\"Finally, Andreas Sperl concludes with his expectations for further developments of Board in the next few years:\u00a0\"I think the topic of artificial intelligence will take on an increasingly broad scope and should also be reflected in future versions of Board. This starts with the creation of reports that I no longer compile with the click of a mouse, but which are automatically created by the AI via voice command. In addition, AI should help me to analyze data and effectively support me in predictive planning.\""

        "company": "RZB",
        "content": "Das UnternehmenAls Licht- und Leuchten-Generalist steht die RZB Rudolf Zimmermann, Bamberg GmbH seit 80 Jahren verbindlich f\u00fcr h\u00f6chsteffiziente Produkte und exzellente Lichtqualit\u00e4t \u201eMade in Germany\u201c. Das Familienunternehmen mit 600 Mitarbeitern in Bamberg bietet ein breites Portfolio von mehr als 20.000 Produkten in den Sparten Innen- und Au\u00dfenleuchten, Sicherheitsleuchten sowie Lichtmanagementsystemen. Die RZB Unternehmensgruppe ist mit etwa 800 Mitarbeitern weltweit in \u00fcber 70 L\u00e4ndern rund um den Globus vertreten. Basierend auf den Leitlinien \u201eSmart Technology\u201c und \u201eExcellent Design\u201d liefert RZB immer wieder beispielgebende L\u00f6sungen und wurde bereits wiederholt mit dem TOP 100-Siegel f\u00fcr \u00fcberdurchschnittliche Innovationserfolge ausgezeichnet. Aufgrund der hohen Fertigungstiefe ist der Begriff Industrie 4.0 f\u00fcr RZB nicht nur ein Schlagwort, sondern gelebte Wirklichkeit: Menschen, Maschinen, Anlagen, Logistik und Produkte kommunizieren und kooperieren miteinander.Die HerausforderungDas zentrale Controlling am Standort Bamberg analysierte die kompletten Unternehmensdaten bisher teils mit Hilfe integrierter Werkzeuge des SAP-ERPs und f\u00fchrte dar\u00fcber hinaus weitere Analysen in Excel durch. Die Excel-Reports hatten auf Grund der fehlenden Datenbankanbindung jedoch das Problem, dass sie monatlich von Hand aktualisiert werden mussten. Das stellte einen immensen Zeitaufwand dar, nahm unn\u00f6tig Ressourcen in Anspruch und verhinderte den Zugriff auf tagesaktuelle Daten. Die erstellten Reports wiederum wurden \u00fcber aufw\u00e4ndig programmierte Routinen an rund 300 Adressaten als PDF verschickt. Waren \u00c4nderungen am Versand der Reports n\u00f6tig oder wurden weitere Details in den Berichten gew\u00fcnscht, war das nur durch weitere Programmierungen durch die IT-Abteilung oder externe Dienstleister machbar. F\u00fcr das Controlling von RZB war das auf Dauer ein unkomfortabler, nicht zufriedenstellender Zustand.Die Board-L\u00f6sung\u201eMit dem Ziel vor Augen, Prozesse zu automatisieren, bessere Analyse- und Planungsm\u00f6glichkeiten zu schaffen und mehr Selbst\u00e4ndigkeit f\u00fcr das Controlling zu gewinnen, haben wir uns dazu entschlossen, eine professionelle Business Intelligence- und Performance Management-L\u00f6sung einzuf\u00fchren\u201c, berichtet Markus Utter, Leiter Controlling bei RZB. \u201eDie bisherige Vorgehensweise war nicht mehr zeitgem\u00e4\u00df und entsprach auch nicht den Werten und Leitlinien, die wir in anderen Unternehmensbereichen v.a. in Hinblick auf unsere Produkte vertreten.\u201cVerschiedene Werkzeuge wurden betrachtet, darunter auch die Board-Entscheidungsfindungsplattform. Board \u00fcberzeugte vor allem durch die nahtlose Verschmelzung von Analyse, Planung, Reporting und Simulation in einer L\u00f6sung. Die Vielschichtigkeit der Anwendungsm\u00f6glichkeiten, z.B. nicht nur internes Reporting, sondern auch externes Rechnungswesen abbilden zu k\u00f6nnen ohne verschiedene Insell\u00f6sungen zu schaffen, wurde mit Begeisterung aufgenommen.Punkten konnte das Werkzeug bei dem Leuchtenhersteller zudem durch die einfache Anbindung von Datenquellen jeglicher Art. So sollte als Datenquelle f\u00fcr das Tool nicht nur das hausinterne ERP SAP fungieren, sondern bspw. auch Exceltabellen eingelesen werden, die der RZB-Standort Malaysia mangels SAP liefert.\u201eBoard bietet eine sehr attraktive Oberfl\u00e4che, die sowohl von uns Controllern als auch allen anderen Mitarbeitern intuitiv zu bedienen ist, da es in der Anwendung den MS Office-Programmen \u00e4hnelt\u201c, erkl\u00e4rt Utter die Entscheidung f\u00fcr die All-in-One-Plattform.Ein wichtiges Argument pro Board war zudem die umfassende MS Office-Integration, welche die Software bietet. Mit wenigen Klicks lassen sich Berichte und Dashboards nach Excel, PowerPoint oder Word exportieren und dort, dank der weiterhin bestehenden Verbindung zur Board-Datenbank bearbeiten bzw. auf Knopfdruck aktualisieren.Der erste Projektschritt umfasste die Abbildung des 10-12-seitigen Management Reports in Board, der bisher einmal im Monat manuell in Excel angefertigt wurde und Ums\u00e4tze, Kosten und Best\u00e4nde enth\u00e4lt. Hinzu kam eine Konzern\u00fcbersicht, die weltweite Standorte wie Malaysia einbindet, um die Gesamtums\u00e4tze der Unternehmensgruppe darzustellen. Durch die automatisierte Erstellung dieser Berichte, egal ob die Daten von SAP oder Excel einflie\u00dfen, hat das Controlling-Team kostbare Zeit gespart.F\u00fcr das bis auf Weiteres vorgesehene Broadcasting wurde ein elegantes Cockpit f\u00fcr die Report-Generierung entwickelt. Damit f\u00e4llt es dem Controlling nun leicht, selbst zu definieren, welche Reports an welche Adressaten in welchem Turnus verschickt werden sollen. Einmal festgelegt, laufen die Routinen automatisiert durch. F\u00fcr die Zukunft ist es jedoch angedacht, dass jeder Nutzer seine Berichte mit Hilfe \u00fcbersichtlicher Cockpits in Board selbst aufruft und nach seinen Bed\u00fcrfnissen dann weitere Analysen durchf\u00fchren kann.Mit der VSB hat das Unternehmen einen engagierten Board-Implementierungspartner gefunden, der vor allem durch die lokale N\u00e4he gut erreichbar ist. Die VSB-Consultants wurden bei der Einf\u00fchrung von der neuen BI-L\u00f6sung direkt vor eine kleine Herausforderung gestellt: RZB w\u00fcnschte sich einen sogenannten Arbeitszeitkalender, mit dessen Hilfe es m\u00f6glich ist, auf die Anzahl tats\u00e4chlicher Arbeitstage bezogen auf gleiche Zeitr\u00e4ume zu vergleichen. Die Aufgabe konnte auf Grund der Flexibilit\u00e4t von Board jedoch sauber gel\u00f6st werden.\u201eDie Zusammenarbeit mit VSB erleben wir als sehr positiv. Die Berater sind kompetent, engagiert und gingen auch w\u00e4hrend der hei\u00dfen Entwicklungsphase auf W\u00fcnsche nach zus\u00e4tzlichen Funktionen ein. Bei Fragen erhalten wir stets kurzfristig R\u00fcckmeldungen, so dass wir uns wirklich sehr gut aufgehoben f\u00fchlen\u201c, beschreibt Markus Utter die Betreuung durch den Board-Partner.In der n\u00e4chsten Projektphase m\u00f6chte Markus Utter mit seinem Team nun die Planungsprozesse in Board abbilden: \u201eDas wird ein gro\u00dfer Schritt f\u00fcr uns, denn daf\u00fcr m\u00fcssen alle Standorte an das System angebunden werden und viele Board-User rund um den Globus mit der neuen Plattform arbeiten.\u201cZun\u00e4chst will das Team die operative Planung angehen. Hier verspricht es sich eine wesentlich gr\u00f6\u00dfere Detailtiefe als das im bisherigen System m\u00f6glich ist.Der Kundennutzen\u201eMit Board haben wir eine Plattform installiert, die wir von der Fachabteilung heraus weitgehend selbstst\u00e4ndig administrieren k\u00f6nnen. Das hat nicht nur Prozesse verschlankt und beschleunigt, sondern schont auch die knappen Ressourcen unserer IT-Abteilung\u201c, erkl\u00e4rt Markus Utter. \u201eDas Controlling-Team hat dank der Zeitersparnisse durch die Prozessautomatisierung rund um Daten, Reporting und Pr\u00e4sentation von Ergebnissen nun die Gelegenheit, sich Bereichen zu widmen, die zuvor aus Zeitmangel nicht aktiv genug verfolgt werden konnten. Heute sind wir in der Lage, das Produktions- und Einkaufscontrolling intensiver zu betrachten und Prozesse zu begleiten.\u201cDurch die Integration von Analyse, Planung, Reporting und Simulation in einer Plattform verspricht sich RZB au\u00dferdem mehr Transparenz und Einblick in die Auswirkungen von Entscheidungen \u00fcber das gesamte Unternehmen hinweg.\u201ePlanung und Reporting betrifft immer das gesamte Unternehmen. Erst wenn alle Abteilungen Hand in Hand arbeiten und f\u00fcr jeden die Zusammenh\u00e4nge der einzelnen Prozesse transparent sind, kann ein Unternehmen effizient gesteuert werden. Mit Board haben wir die perfekte Grundlage daf\u00fcr geschaffen\u201c, fasst Markus Utter zusammen."

Inoltre pianificare le attivit\u00e0 e le azioni consente di determinare per tempo gli impegni e le necessit\u00e0 volte a organizzare e ottimizzare le risorse aziendali.In questo contesto si \u00e8 collocato Board che, grazie alla sua caratteristica di unificare le funzioni di Business Intelligence, di pianificazione e di analisi ha consentito a Distillerie Franciacorta, in collaborazione con GOOD NUMBERS, di realizzare una soluzione operativa per i decisori, in grado di raccordare strategia e operativit\u00e0.Il progetto Board in Distillerie Franciacorta \u00e8 ormai pervasivo e coinvolge in modo trasversale i processi aziendali dalle vendite, alla produzione, dalla logistica, alla finanza e alla direzione generale. La condivisione delle informazioni e la visione globale ed univoca del dato hanno prodotto un risparmio di tempo nelle comunicazioni tra funzioni aziendali e nelle riunioni strategicooperative.Affrontare le sfide del mercato\u00a0 con il giusto \u201cspirito\u201d, il controllo dei margini nelle trattative\u00a0L'espansione dell'azienda e le opportunit\u00e0 derivanti dai nuovi mercati esteri avevano evidenziato l\u2019esigenza di una maggior rapidit\u00e0 nel controllo delle marginalit\u00e0 e di una sua stabilizzazione senza compromettere la competitivit\u00e0. In questo scenario Distillerie Franciacorta ha scelto Board con l\u2019obiettivo di fornire al management ed ai vari livelli operativi una soluzione rapida ed efficace a sostegno dei processi decisionali.Il controllo di gestione, integrando le informazioni delle vendite con quelle delle altre aree aziendali, ha definito i parametri e le procedure per implementare un sistema in grado di elaborare mensilmente un conto economico consuntivo e previsionale, analizzabile a vari livello di dettaglio.Il modello si \u00e8 dimostrato fin da subito snello e flessibile, integrando: cruscotti direzionali, indicatori aggregati, viste e analisi di dettaglio per valutare la marginalit\u00e0 del singolo cliente o del singolo prodotto.\u00a0 In questo modo \u00e8 stato possibile attivare opportune azioni correttive capaci di mantenere la marginalit\u00e0 a livelli tali da soddisfare le richieste del management aziendale.La fruibilit\u00e0 del dato ai diversi livelli di dettaglio e la possibilit\u00e0 di effettuare calcoli senza scrivere codice di programmazione hanno reso evidente - fin dal processo di selezione - che Board sarebbe stato uno strumento potente al servizio della forza vendita per simulare e controllare la marginalit\u00e0 degli ordini di vendita prima della loro accettazione.Abbiamo cos\u00ec iniziato un processo di analisi per identificare regole e parametri standard, ricavati e calcolati a partire dal conto economico di chiusura e dal conto economico di budget, applicabili alla analisi di marginalit\u00e0 degli ordini. Una volta consolidato il modello dati e accertata la qualit\u00e0 dei risultati, abbiamo sviluppato e implementato il modello Board definitivo.In questa prima fase il sistema di analisi della marginalit\u00e0 veniva alimentato dal sistema ERP dove gli ordini venivano inseriti in modalit\u00e0 provvisoria per poi essere analizzati da Board. I dati generati dal software hanno avuto l\u2019effetto di identificare in anticipo situazioni non conformi agli standard aziendali e di attivare opportune azioni correttive quali: revisione delle politiche di prezzo, revisione della scontistica e degli incentivi all\u2019acquisto rivolti ai clienti, etc. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Il modello Board ha portato fin da subito benefici quantificabili sia economicamente che organizzativamente, introducendo un nuovo modus operandi nel processo commerciale.La crescente consapevolezza dell\u2019importanza delle informazioni e il costante contributo consulenziale di GOOD NUMBERS hanno agito da propulsore per lo sviluppo di nuovi progetti. Abbiamo quindi deciso di procedere oltre, realizzando in Board un sistema di simulazione degli ordini che potesse fornire indicazioni di marginalit\u00e0 gi\u00e0 in fase di contrattazione, ancor prima dell\u2019inserimento nel sistema gestionale ERP. Anche in questo caso il successo \u00e8 stato tale che l\u2019azienda ha adottato il modello in tutte le fasi della contrattazione con i clienti e nei processi di valutazione di potenziali business strategici.Alessandro Tavano, amministratore e responsabile amministrazione e finanza ha dichiarato: \u201cIl modello di simulazione delle marginalit\u00e0 degli ordini ci permette di adottare le opportune azioni correttive in tempi rapidissimi, quando \u00e8 ancora possibile la negoziazione. In questo modo riusciamo a soddisfare le esigenze del cliente\u00a0 e a garantire il margine atteso dall\u2019azienda.\u201dLa pianificazione degli acquisti e l\u2019evoluzione dei prezzi. L\u2019impatto economico finanziario delle strategie di approvvigionamentoQuando il costo delle materie prime \u00e8 soggetto ad elevata variabilit\u00e0 \u00e8 fondamentale pianificare con attenzione l\u2019approvvigionamento per rispettare le marginalit\u00e0 che l\u2019azienda si \u00e8 prefissata e per controllare le dinamiche di acquisto, con particolare attenzione all\u2019evoluzione dei prezzi e all\u2019effetto mix.Per questo motivo abbiamo deciso di realizzare un modello su Board che ci consenta di simulare, sulla base della previsione dei prezzi d\u2019acquisto, scenari alternativi relativamente all\u2019impatto dei costi delle materie sui costi industriali dei prodotti finiti. Questo modello \u00e8 diventato uno strumento imprescindibile per la direzione acquisti nella pianificazione dei tempi e volumi\u00a0 di approvvigionamento.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Il modello mette a disposizione due algoritmi in modo da rispondere alle diverse esigenze in termini di rapidit\u00e0 e precisione.\u00a0 Il primo algoritmo, semi-automatico, non richiede particolari interventi da parte dell\u2019utente e produce rapidamente risultati sufficientemente precisi e analizzabili ad un certo livello di aggregazione. Il secondo algoritmo richiede all\u2019utente di fornire parametri aggiuntivi (previsioni dei volumi di vendita, previsione dei prezzi di acquisto, etc.)\u00a0 necessari a \u201craffinare\u201d e dettagliare i risultati.Nel caso specifico dei prezzi di acquisto l\u2019utente pu\u00f2 inserire un listino previsionale analizzando: le serie storiche, i listini di budget, i contratti aperti e i prezzi medi di acquisto. Tutte queste informazioni sono agilmente disponibili e confrontabili sulla piattaforma Board grazie alle sue funzionalit\u00e0 native di Business Intelligence e all\u2019 ergonomia delle applicazioni sviluppate da GOOD NUMBERS.Una volta identificata la miglior combinazione di prezzi e volumi, Board \u00e8 in grado di determinare i fabbisogni delle materie da acquistare basandosi sui dati di forecast tramite l\u2019esplosione delle distinte basi. Il modello considera anche altre variabili fondamentali di processo, quali: giacenze di magazzino; livelli di sicurezza delle scorte; quantit\u00e0 minime di acquisto.Luigi Gozio, amministratore ha affermato: \u201cValutare scenari alternativi simulando i costi delle materie prime e predisporre un piano di approvvigionamento in accordo con gli obiettivi di business si \u00e8 rivelato fondamentale sia per gestire i processi di contrattazione con i fornitori,\u00a0 che nel controllo delle marginalit\u00e0 sui prodotti finiti\u201d.Ottimizzare le risorse produttive per mantenere un adeguato livello delle scorte evitando mancanze o giacenze eccessiveAdattare la capacit\u00e0 produttiva al mutare delle condizioni del mercato e ottimizzare l\u2019impiego delle risorse in modo agile e adeguato agli obiettivi di business\u00a0 erano obiettivi a cui dare risposta. Il processo di distillazione ed invecchiamento dei vitigni \u00e8 complesso e la variabile tempo, unitamente alla disponibilit\u00e0 di materie prime e impianti, sono rilevanti per soddisfare la domanda.Per affrontare la pianificazione del processo produttivo e di approvvigionamento in modo sistematico e flessibile abbiamo deciso di sviluppare un modello Board in grado di elaborare scenari alternativi, con l\u2019obiettivo di fornire informazioni utili per decidere eventuali azioni di ottimizzazione dell\u2019intero ciclo.Grazie all'ergonomia dell\u2019applicazione costruita su Board gli utenti possono facilmente definire il perimetro di analisi, ovvero stabilire l\u2019orizzonte temporale entro cui effettuare la simulazione, impostare le quantit\u00e0 da produrre e le risorse da impegnare. Le procedure di Board, tenendo conto delle disponibilit\u00e0 di distillato a magazzino, degli acquisti previsti e degli utilizzi pianificati, determinano rapidamente eventuali rotture di stock.I risultati della simulazione, consultabili a colpo d\u2019occhio per mezzo di grafici riepilogativi e report di controllo, forniscono informazioni che consentono di attuare opportune azioni correttive sui piani di approvvigionamento e di produzione per sostenere la domanda e garantire la puntuale evasione degli ordini di vendita.L\u2019unificazione delle funzioni di Business Intelligence e Performance Management in Board, la capacit\u00e0 di garantire la correlazione fra dati e informazioni afferenti alle diverse funzioni aziendali (commerciale, acquisti, produzione, logistica, etc.) e la possibilit\u00e0 di condividere informazioni hanno contribuito a migliorare il funzionamento complessivo dell\u2019organizzazione, evitando che la singola funzione prenda decisioni senza valutare l\u2019impatto con il resto dell\u2019azienda.Stefano Gozio, amministratore e responsabile produzione ha concluso: \u201dAncora una volta il contributo di GOOD NUMBERS nella fase di analisi e di realizzazione delle applicazioni, unitamente alle caratteristiche di Board, hanno garantito una ampia fruibilit\u00e0 delle soluzioni dimodoch\u00e9 gli utenti si possano concentrare sull\u2019analisi dei dati e degli obiettivi di business, invece di gestire la complessit\u00e0 delle procedure\u201d\u00a0"

        "company": "HOLTER Group",
        "content": "HOLTER Group is a plumbing and heating wholesaler based in Wels, Upper Austria. This family-owned company offers the complete product range for plumbing, heating, installation, cooling, ventilation, renewable energy, and control technology as well as providing consulting services for installers and specialist tradespeople. HOLTER has 10 showrooms featuring an extensive selection of products and materials, state-of-the-art bathroom and swimming pool planning tools, and advice centers for spa and wellbeing purchases.HOLTER is a family business with the power of a startup. Despite many years of tradition and successful growth, the company has mastered the skill of reinventing itself time and again to respond to the changing needs of its customers and market.The Challenge: Achieving a reliable staffing forecastHOLTER employs more than 850 people at 25 different locations in Germany and Austria, which was making it difficult to gain a complete overview of personnel development and undertake accurate staff forecasting.Staffing forecasts were prepared by the Controlling team at HOLTER\u2019s main office using Excel and special features in the accounting system, but these were restricted to managing HR for the current fiscal year only. Controlling would receive information about staff changes by email, phone, or other standard communication tools, making it difficult to control and monitor changes as they would often receive the information late, if at all. As a result, the monthly staffing forecast could take up to 15 working days to produce and was prone to errors.HOLTER began looking for a solution that would guide the process consistently, reduce errors, increase the quality of the staffing forecast, and significantly shorten the setup process.The Solution: Meeting all needs in a single platformAfter a review of the market, HOLTER chose the Board Intelligent Planning Platform, which would not only take care of the staffing forecast but also replace the Controlling components of the accounting system in one solution.The team liked that the coding-free, drag-and-drop nature of the Board platform would enable the gradual introduction, development, optimization, and expansion of applications as required. Thomas Schendl, Head of Financial Controlling at HOLTER, explains why Board was the best fit for the organization\u2019s needs:With the migration, we took the opportunity to redefine a number of our processes. By introducing these changes step-by-step with Board, we gave our organization the framework it needed to implement and internalize them before moving on to the next point. Other products that we considered in the selection process contained predefined applications that, firstly, could not have offered the flexibility we wanted, and secondly were far too complex for our startup.The intuitive nature of Board reduces training requirements for employees. The Controlling team attended Board's in-house training courses on the topics of:Planning with BoardAnalyzing and reporting with BoardBuilding a multidimensional Dashboard with Board.These training courses took a total of just five training days. Controlling then offered a three-hour user training session for the heads of the various departments. 29 department heads are now up and running with the system, adding local staff changes to the staffing forecast with ease.The Benefits: Staffing forecasts in half the timeWith the Board platform, HOLTER can now conduct a monthly, rolling staffing forecast at the employee level. Department heads can perform local variance analysis for personnel costs, regional sales managers can carry out their sales planning at the customer level, and local managers can easily enter salary and pay-related staff changes themselves.Employees work with the Board web client and use the built-in broadcast feature to inform colleagues about the availability of new forecast versions and monthly completion deadlines through automated messages.Entering data at a specific area level delivers better quality monthly staffing forecasts, as the data is always delivered on time. There is also an integrated approval workflow between the head of department, the line manager, and Controlling, which complies with company guidelines and means the reported data is continuously monitored. Thomas explains:With the help of the Board platform, we have reduced the time it takes to complete our monthly staffing forecast by more than 50%. We now have the forecast after a maximum of just seven working days, instead of the 15 working days we used to have to wait.The Controlling team can also create databases and interfaces themselves without any advanced IT programming skills, thanks to the programming-free nature of Board. The data from the existing ERP system is easily connected by ODBC data import for immediate use, removing the error-prone manual input. Thomas confirms:With our old system, the system provider was the only one who could make even simple changes, like adding columns in the report. With Board, each department \u2013 in this case, Controlling \u2013 can develop the application themselves without any in-depth programming skills.Future plans: Platform expansionHOLTER is planning to introduce further applications, the next being Board Financial Consolidation, a prebuilt solution that enables companies to perform both legally prescribed consolidation tasks and management consolidation within Board's unified environment. Board Financial Consolidation helps to manage investment forecasts for buildings, IT, and vehicles and includes a short-term cash-flow control feature.Once implemented, Board Financial Consolidation will allow the HOLTER team to prepare detailed group reports and quick financial statements, giving the management team detailed insights into financial and operational results as well as full financial control."

        "content": "Das UnternehmenDie Privatbrauerei Zwettl mit Sitz im n\u00f6rdlichen Nieder\u00f6sterreich besteht seit 1708. Der j\u00e4hrliche Bieraussto\u00df von \u201eZwettler\u201c belief sich 2017 auf rund 188.000 Hektoliter Bier und der Gesamtumsatz des Waldviertler Familienunternehmens betrug im Jahr 2016 23,9 Millionen Euro. 120 Mitarbeiter sind direkt bei der Privatbrauerei besch\u00e4ftigt, indirekt sichert sie dank der Vielfalt an Zulieferern in der Region sehr viele Arbeitspl\u00e4tze. Nachhaltiges Agieren steht im Fokus der Brauerei: So stammen die Rohstoffe Brauwasser, Hopfen und Braugerste \u00fcberwiegend aus der Region. Als erste heimische Brauerei unterzog sich Zwettler einer gesamtheitlichen \u00d6kobilanz und nutzt die aufgezeigten Potenziale, noch umweltfreundlicher und \u00f6kologischer zu werden. 2008 wurde die Brauerei zum \u201eNieder\u00f6sterreichischen Familienunternehmen des Jahres\u201c gek\u00fcrt und 2011 mit dem N\u00d6 Tourismuspreis ausgezeichnet.\u00a0Die HerausforderungNachdem die Umstellung des ERP-Systems abgeschlossen war, begab sich Zwettl auf die Suche nach einem Business Intelligence-Tool, das Reporting, Analyse und Planung komplett abbilden kann. Zum Ziel setzte sich Zwettl eine vollintegrierte Unternehmensplanung und ein klassisches Management Cockpit, in welchem sich die Gesch\u00e4ftsleitung mit wenigen Klicks informieren kann.Das bis 2012 im Controlling vorrangig genutzte MS Excel brachte die weitl\u00e4ufig bekannten Probleme mit sich: langwieriges Datensammeln, mangelhafte Daten-Transparenz und -Qualit\u00e4t und die stete Gefahr, dass in Abstimmungsrunden nicht alle von den selben Daten sprachen.\u00a0Die L\u00f6sungDas Initial-Projekt, die Absatz- und Kostenstellenplanung, war nach knapp vier Monaten komplett implementiert. Als Basis dient ein von CONTRACT Controlling entwickeltes Board-Modul, das betriebswirtschaftliche Vorg\u00e4nge und Logiken bereits vordefiniert hat. Damit war eine besonders schnelle Implementierung m\u00f6glich ohne aber darauf verzichten zu m\u00fcssen, Anpassungen entsprechend der W\u00fcnsche und Prozesse von Zwettl einfach vornehmen zu k\u00f6nnen.Willibald Schindler, Controller und Projektleiter bei Zwettl erinnert sich: \u201eDas Tolle an der Projektarbeit war, dass ich von Anfang an immer dabei war.\u201c So konnte er nicht nur schnell lernen, mit dem Tool zu arbeiten und es selbstst\u00e4ndig weiterzuentwickeln, sondern auch die wachsende Anwendung genau nach seinen W\u00fcnschen formen. Heute betreut er das System gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils allein.\u201eMit Board f\u00e4llt uns immer wieder etwas Neues ein, das wir noch umsetzen k\u00f6nnten. Die M\u00f6glichkeiten, die Board einem bietet, wenn man sich damit besch\u00e4ftigt und offen f\u00fcr neue Prozesse ist, sind der Wahnsinn.\u201c Nicht verwunderlich also, dass Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt weitere Board-Module von CONTRACT Controlling und damit immer neue Anwendungsfelder hinzu kamen, so dass die L\u00f6sung heute eine durchg\u00e4ngige Planung von A-Z abdeckt: Absatz, Umsatz, Personal, Investitionen, Abschreibungen, Ergebnis der gew\u00f6hnlichen Gesch\u00e4ftst\u00e4tigkeit (EGT), Cashflow und Finanzen \u2013 alles wird in Board geplant.F\u00fcr die Jahresbudgetierung wurde der Ansatz einer integrierten Erfolgs- und Finanzplanung umgesetzt. Ausgehend von einem detaillierten Absatz-/Umsatzbudget auf Kundenebene inklusive der zugeh\u00f6rigen Wareneins\u00e4tze wird eine klassische Kostenarten-/Kostenstellenplanung um diese Werte erg\u00e4nzt und so ein gesamtes Unternehmensplanergebnis berechnet. Auf Basis einer Investitionsbudgetierung mit automatisierter AfA-Berechnung wird das Anlageverm\u00f6gen f\u00fcr das Planungsjahr eingesch\u00e4tzt. Forderungen, Verbindlichkeiten und die Mehrwertsteuerplanung erfolgen durch automatisierte Berechnungslogiken. Die \u00fcbrigen Bilanzpositionen werden auf Kontenebene geplant. Durch den Berechnungsmechanismus f\u00fcr die Integration zwischen Erfolgsrechnung und Bilanz kann neben der Planerfolgsrechnung und der Planbilanz auch eine Plan-Cashflow-Rechnung durchgef\u00fchrt werden.F\u00fcr das Reporting werden t\u00e4glich Ist-Zahlen in Board geladen, so dass Plan-Ist-Abweichungen sofort mit Ampeln angezeigt und die Ursachen analysiert werden k\u00f6nnen. F\u00fcr Schindler ist die Kunden-Deckungsbeitragsrechnung in Board die K\u00fcr der gesamten Applikation. \u201eWir hatten mit den CONTRACT-Modulen die ideale Grundlage und konnten trotzdem noch alles so flexibel modellieren, dass es nun perfekt zu unseren Best Practices passt.\u201cDie fertige Anwendung bestimmt heute das t\u00e4gliche Arbeiten im Controlling, Vertrieb und Management. F\u00fcr Schindler ist \u201eein Tag ohne Board kein guter Tag.\u201c Auch der Vertriebsleiter best\u00e4tigt: \u201eDie Board-L\u00f6sung macht s\u00fcchtig \u2013 so leicht kamen wir fr\u00fcher nicht an Daten. Ganz zu schweigen davon, diese dann auf die Schnelle zu analysieren oder von aggregierten Kennzahlen auf die darunter liegenden Detail-Informationen drillen zu k\u00f6nnen.\u201c\u00a0Der KundennutzenDurch die Einf\u00fchrung von Board stehen s\u00e4mtliche Daten in einer zentralen L\u00f6sung zur Verf\u00fcgung. Umfangreiche manuelle Arbeitsprozesse zur Aufbereitung von Daten in MS Word, Excel und PowerPoint konnten erheblich reduziert und so Zeit zur \u00dcbernahme neuer Aufgaben geschaffen werden. Datenfehler und Inkonsistenzen, die aufgrund von manuellen \u00dcbernahmen in bisherigen Berichten auftraten, konnten durch die Nutzung des Board Office Add-ins beseitigt werden.Der Umfang der Auswertungsm\u00f6glichkeiten ist erheblich erweitert worden. Vorhandene Daten k\u00f6nnen leichter und in h\u00f6herem Detaillierungsrad sowie performanter \u00fcber verschiedene Dimensionen analysiert werden. Mittels moderner Analysemethoden (Ampel-, Cockpit, Drill-Down-Filter-, Such-, Simulations-Funktionen) stehen viele M\u00f6glichkeiten zur Darstellung von Finanz- und Leistungsdaten zur Verf\u00fcgung, die zuvor gar nicht oder nur mit gro\u00dfem Aufwand h\u00e4tten erstellt werden k\u00f6nnen.\u00a0"

        "content": "The CompanyThe Hanover-based Robinson Club GmbH, a member of the TUI Group, is Germany's\u00a0market leader in the premium segment for club-based vacations. At the present time, its portfolio includes 23 Club facilities and one townhouse, spread across eleven countries with a total bednight capacity of 12,600.About 40 years ago, Robinson laid the foundation for an entirely new kind of vacation: a quality offering that placed much greater emphasis on the individuality of its guests. By pursuing a consistent brand strategy and through continuous quality improvement, Robinson has exerted a decisive influence on the concept of club-based holidays and has secured itself a substantial competitive edge over all the other providers in this field.\u00a0The ChallengeIn the context of introducing new hotel software and through a rolling programme of upgrades to the full extent of IT systems, a need arose to optimize the entire range of planning and reporting processes. Core elements in this optimization process included a clear definition of the information required, and the procurement of a technology platform capable on the one hand of conducting flexible, multidimensional OLAP analyses and, on the other hand, of delivering standard reporting facilities.Alongside pure analysis work, the platform needed to be configured in such a way as to provide effective support to the optimized planning processes and functions. The previous planning and reporting system was characterized by the need for a high level of data collation and pre-processing. SDG consulting AG, a long-term partner of Board, was on hand to assist the company with the implementation of the project.\u00a0\u00a0The Board Solution\u00a0The first step towards optimization was to conduct a detailed analysis. Once all relevant reports had been assembled from the departments involved, together with a distribution address lists and frequency of report generation, the project team was able to categorize the full range of reports. With these systematically processed blocks of information, it was then possible to run workshops with the departments involved. During these workshops the characteristics and parameters required were identified, and the dimensions required to accommodate these factors decided upon. This process culminated in the design of a multidimensional data model, which enabled all relevant data to be obtained.The information gathered from the various different source systems soon made it clear that all the data needed to be collated and pre-processed in a central data warehouse (DWH). The structure for this DWH was implemented on an MS SQL server platform and the data from the various different source systems is now updated each night with the help of SSIS packages (SQL Server Integration Services). Thereafter, the data is consolidated and checked in accordance with defined routines. The outcome of this nightly update is a consistent set of data for use by Board's multidimensional analysis and planning tool.Using this solution, the various departments involved are able to analyze their most critical data, sourced from various dimensions, and can do so quickly. This includes, for example, the number of bednights, and the associated room utilization levels (single occupancy in double rooms etc.) in each Club, room category, and the latest booking status. All this information can be layered in other dimensions, e.g. the bookings channel or guest demographics, using a drill-down feature involving just a few clicks of the mouse. This completely eliminates the manual operation of processing data, and standard reports can be distributed automatically with the help of a report enrolment facility. This enables all users to obtain the specific information they require for their daily work, and to do so faster and more reliably.\u00a0Customer BenefitsAn enhanced level of transparency with utilization analyses has been achieved by simplifying the reporting process. This has substantially reduced the resource required to pre-process data. Moreover, multidimensional analyses are now much easier to cover from all defined levels and are very easy to implement.During the implementation of the reporting process, due account was taken of the future need to use the Board product\u00a0for the analysis of planning data.\u00a0\u00a0"

        "content": "Das UnternehmenSTIEBEL ELTRON geh\u00f6rt weltweit zu den Markt- und Technologief\u00fchrern in den Bereichen Haustechnik und erneuerbare Energien. Mit f\u00fcnf Produktionsst\u00e4tten weltweit, 24 internationalen Tochtergesellschaften sowie Vertriebsorganisationen und Vertretungen in \u00fcber 120 L\u00e4ndern ist STIEBEL ELTRON global aufgestellt. \u00dcber 40 Prozent des Umsatzes entfallen auf das Ausland.Im Mittelpunkt der STIEBEL ELTRON-Gruppe \u2013 mit einem Gesamtumsatz in 2013 von \u00fcber 460 Millionen Euro und weltweit 3.000 Besch\u00e4ftigten \u2013 stehen die STIEBEL ELTRON GmbH & Co. KG sowie die STIEBEL ELTRON International GmbH mit ihren nationalen und internationalen Vertriebsorganisationen.\u00a0Die HerausforderungAusgehend von einer manuellen Excel-Planung begab sich STIEBEL ELTRON auf die Suche nach einem modernen und effizienten Planungstool. Bis dahin planten die Vertriebsorganisationen weltweit einmal j\u00e4hrlich in einem mit historischen Daten bef\u00fcllten Excel-Sheet. Dieses musste zuvor l\u00e4nderspezifisch pro Vertriebsverantwortlichem hinsichtlich der zu planenden Artikel samt Preis und W\u00e4hrung vorbereitet werden. Mit der Zusammenf\u00fchrung in m\u00fchevoller Kleinstarbeit war die zentrale Verwaltung in Holzminden jedes Jahr rund acht Wochen besch\u00e4ftigt. Der Planungsprozess war dementsprechend enorm aufwendig, intransparent und durch das manuelle Zusammenf\u00fchren fehleranf\u00e4llig. Eine Aktualisierung der Planungen fand nur sporadisch und bezogen auf erkannte Problembereiche statt.Diesen Zustand wollte STIEBEL ELTRON durch einen standardisierten und transparenten Planungsprozess, umgesetzt mit einem geeigneten Planungstool, hinter sich lassen. Ziel war es, den Planungsprozess so effizient wie m\u00f6glich zu gestalten, die Fehlerquote zu senken und aktuelle Erkenntnisse st\u00e4ndig einflie\u00dfen zu lassen, um damit die Planungsg\u00fcte zu erh\u00f6hen.Im Rahmen eines Proof of Concept und anschlie\u00dfenden Analyseworkshop \u00fcberzeugte Board mit seinen umfassenden und flexiblen Planungsfunktionalit\u00e4ten und die Berater von Board-Partner Celver AG mit ihrer Umsetzungskompetenz. Insbesondere die universelle Einsatzm\u00f6glichkeit von Board sowie die programmierfreie Nutzung \u00fcberzeugten STIEBEL ELTRON im Vergleich zu diversen anderen Planungswerkzeugen.\u00a0Die Board-L\u00f6sungBevor die detaillierte Umsetzung der rollierenden Vertriebs- und Absatzplanung als Teil des neu entwickelten Planungsprozesses begann, wurden zun\u00e4chst die ben\u00f6tigten Daten aus SAP in einem neuen Data Warehouse (Microsoft SQL Server) zusammengef\u00fchrt. Die ab sofort n\u00e4chtlich stattfindende Datenkonsolidierung und -pr\u00fcfung schafft die konsistente Datenbasis als Grundlage f\u00fcr eine effiziente Planungsapplikation.Ausgangspunkt f\u00fcr die Planung ist ein grundlegendes Reporting. Durch die direkte Integration der Berichte in die Planungsoberfl\u00e4chen hat der Planer die M\u00f6glichkeit zum unmittelbaren Vergleich der Werte. Aus diesen Daten generiert Board anhand individuell definierter Algorithmen und unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung von saisonalen Einflussfaktoren Vorschlagswerte f\u00fcr die bis zu 3.000 verschiedenen zu planenden Artikel pro Vertriebsbereich und Monat. Innerhalb der Planungsoberfl\u00e4che k\u00f6nnen die Vertriebsverantwortlichen nun auf der gew\u00fcnschten Ebene \u2013 beispielsweise Produktgruppe, Vertriebsgebiet oder direkt auf Artikel-Ebene \u2013 planen. Hierf\u00fcr m\u00fcssen lediglich bei Bedarf die vorgeschlagenen St\u00fcckzahlen angepasst und wenn n\u00f6tig Preismodifikationen vorgenommen werden.Auf Basis der Vertriebsplanung wurde eine automatische St\u00fccklistenaufl\u00f6sung f\u00fcr Verkaufssets, die aus mehreren lagerhaltigen und verkaufsf\u00e4higen Komponenten bestehen, integriert. Daraus resultiert unter Einbezug von Faktoren wie Lagerbest\u00e4nden, Meldebest\u00e4nden, Lieferzeiten etc. ein tagesaktueller Bedarfsplan, der n\u00e4chtlich an SAP zur\u00fcckgegeben wird und so die Bestell- und Produktionsprozesse unterst\u00fctzt. Neben der rollierenden Planung realisierte das Projektteam eine Folgejahrplanung, Mittelfristplanung, Marktplanung sowie eine Szenario-Umgebung.Mit zunehmender Anwendererfahrung erweiterte STIEBEL ELTRON die Applikation um eine Zubeh\u00f6rplanung. Auch hier liefert Board automatisch die Planzahlen der Zubeh\u00f6rartikel. Dabei ist ma\u00dfgeblich, wie oft bei einem Artikel in der Vergangenheit statistisch ein Zubeh\u00f6rteil mitverkauft wurde. Absolutes Highlight dabei: Sobald ein Vertriebsverantwortlicher die Menge an W\u00e4rmepumpen plant, errechnet Board auf Wunsch ad hoc die zu erwartende Menge an relevantem Zubeh\u00f6r.Der KundennutzenMit der Einf\u00fchrung von Board hat STIEBEL ELTRON den gesamten Planungsprozess um ein Vielfaches beschleunigt und ist gezielt den Weg von einer statischen, zeitpunktorientierten Planung hin zu einer rollierenden gegangen. Alleine die vormals achtw\u00f6chige Planungsvorbereitung erfolgt nun automatisiert \u00fcber Nacht \u2013 jede Nacht. Die wegfallende manuelle Excel-Zusammenf\u00fchrung spart nicht nur Zeit und Aufwand, sondern minimiert auch die Fehlerquote enorm. Parallel erm\u00f6glicht die zentrale Datenverwaltung einen maximal transparenten Planungsprozess. Davon profitiert auch das Supply Chain Management, denn mit dem stets aktuellen Bedarfsplan in SAP lassen sich die Bestell- und Produktionsprozesse optimal unterst\u00fctzen. Auch der Aufwand f\u00fcr die \u00dcberleitung der Bedarfsplanung in die Produktions- und Beschaffungsplanung ist in Teilbereichen deutlich gesunken, was in der Folge wieder eine sehr viel detailliertere Planung erm\u00f6glicht. Das wirkt sich ausgesprochen g\u00fcnstig auf Bestandskennzahlen, Lieferf\u00e4higkeit und die Planung der Produktionskapazit\u00e4ten aus.STIEBEL ELTRON nutzt die Board-Applikation aber nicht nur f\u00fcr rein operative Zwecke, sondern auch f\u00fcr die Umsatzplanung. So werden die einzelnen Vertriebsverantwortlichen an ihren eigenen Planvorgaben gemessen und einzelne Umsatzziele festgehalten."

        "company": "L&Q Housing Association",
        "content": "Business ObjectivesReduce the effort\u00a0required to obtain a holistic view of the business, consolidate financial and operational information from all 20 operating entities plus numerous joint ventures, and enable self-sufficiency for analysis and reporting.The CompanyFounded in 1963, L&Q is a leading housing association in the UK and one of London's largest residential developers. Dedicated to building high-quality homes to meet a range of needs and incomes, L&Q also provides a number of other residential services including property management and investment within local communities.\u00a0As a non-profit organization, L&Q works alongside 90 local authorities to manage over 95,000 homes across London and the South East, providing\u00a0affordable rental accommodation and low-cost home ownership schemes.Business ChallengesL&Q has been working with Board since 2011, and has enhanced the solution to meet changing requirements. The initial scope of the project was driven by the need for an alternative method of collating information from its Finance, Housing Management, Maintenance Management, and HR systems to provide a corporate-wide overview of performance, which would, in turn,\u00a0reduce the risk element of managing this information.The existing process,\u00a0which involved the IT team\u00a0collating data from multiple networks of spreadsheets to produce monthly KPI report packs, was costly and prone to manual error, with the average pack taking a week and a half to produce.\u00a0The initial objective was to find a BI replacement for the existing solutions, in addition to removing\u00a0the reliance on the hundreds of spreadsheets being transferred from department to department, to give a real-time view of performance using interactive dashboards.Ian Webster, Finance Strategy Manager at L&Q explains:\u201cOur two key KPI report packs are produced monthly. The Executive Group and Board Pack, which is 20 pages long, includes measures such as growth and financial health (cost per unit, operating margins etc.), customer satisfaction, sales performance and handover stats relating to new builds. Our Operational pack, which is 45 pages long, contains a huge number of KPIs including turnover, rental incomes and arrears, repair\u00a0time and quality, estate quality gradings, and complaints. Both reports pull information from our finance, housing\u00a0and maintenance management systems, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and other sources such as customer surveys. The manual production of these collated reports was obviously extremely time-consuming.\u201dSelection ProcessRecognizing the need for a more efficient way of working and a futureproofed solution, L&Q used Gartner as a starting point for analyzing the available options. After a detailed comparison of the market, which included SAP BusinessObjects, Qlik,\u00a0and Microstrategy, L&Q invited several vendors to present their solutions, judging them based upon the speed at which the software could present the information back to the business and the ability to have sound governance of that information.As a non-profit organization in a recovering economic climate, L&Q needed to get the finance team to engage and buy into the project as a first initiative. The business didn\u2019t want to solve everything at once but wanted some quick wins in the early adoption stages.\u201cSome vendors suggested 18 months - 2 years in project build time because they weren\u2019t able to combine fast execution with enterprise capabilities,\u201d says Ian. \u201cBoard delivered a POC which showed speed of delivery and powerful functionality. The MS Office add-in also made a big impact in the selection process. Being able to provide that\u00a0familiar working environment,\u00a0along with the\u00a0clean look and feel of the solution, showed us that we could easily train and engage our teams in using the software. We decided to go directly\u00a0to the providers rather than use consultancies and that enabled us to build a relationship really quickly with the Board team, which has made a real difference to the running of the project.\u201dThe ProjectThe initial phase of the implementation was a success and has gone from strength to strength since then,\u00a0as Ian explains:\u201cOur IT team worked seamlessly with Board to get the project up and running very quickly. We\u2019ve done other system implementations and therefore we understood that the relationship is key to a successful implementation. It wasn\u2019t just the front of house people that sold the project to us, but the technical team behind the scenes.The implementation went very smoothly, with\u00a0the internal business case taking longer than the start of the deployment. The initial phase of the project took a couple of months to complete but we were able to use the software straight away and start thinking about our rollout plan. There are now trained teams, that didn\u2019t exist before, using Board on a day-to-day basis across the business. We focused initially on Maintenance as we spend over \u00a3150m a year keeping properties up to scratch and use a combination of in-house teams and external contractors, so monitoring and reviewing the performance to ensure we are keeping our spend in line is a key driver. However it is never a complete journey; the project has continued to grow as\u00a0we use Board across more and more areas of the business.\u201dBusiness BenefitsWith a growing presence across the business, L&Q now has 140 power users across different departments and over 600 concurrent lite+ users.\u00a0As a business with a strong learning culture, its employees have enjoyed exploring the software. Having used Board now for several years, L&Q is realizing numerous business benefits.\u201cThe monthly Executive and Operational report packs which used to take weeks to manually collate are now produced in PowerPoint using Board's Microsoft Office plug-in, which means a single click refreshes the entire dataset,\u201d says Ian. \u201cThis is obviously a huge time-saver. We also now consolidate financials from 20 operating entities using Board, making it easy to produce financial statements and notes, and all of our stock grading is now done in Board too, fed by data from Keystone. This allows us to understand cashflow and maintenance capital costs per unit or per scheme over 30 years with ease.\"L&Q uses this forecast to regularly review its 95,000 properties, looking at the bottom 5% and taking timely decisions on their future.\u00a0The self-sufficiency to query any data across the business is another key benefit, which has reduced reliance on the IT department, removed the time wasted on phone calls by finance business partners relating to data queries and ensures the latest information is always in use. The performance management team, which previously had to submit data queries to find the detailed information needed for their internal presentations, can now use Board's easy drag-and-drop interface to build interactive dashboards to transform data into information instantly. Similar benefits can be found in the Anti-Social Behavior team, which\u00a0monitors resident behavior, and the Complaints team which\u00a0analyzes\u00a0the maintenance team\u2019s performance.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve also got a big focus on the building of new homes, working with contractors and other housing associations on joint ventures and sharing our finances and development experience,\u201d continues Ian. \u201cWe currently build 2,500 new homes a year with a view to increasing this to 10,000 in the near future, and Board's interactive dashboards will be helping us measure key KPIs against these developments such as costs, completion and handover rates, and defects, in real-time.\u201dIan\u2019s advice to others is to understand where internal engagement is needed to start the adoption process before looking into the vendor selection process. In doing this, L&Q identified the needs and wants of the whole business from a department-up as well as an enterprise-wide view, ensuring a smooth implementation and software adoption across all users."

As a result, the team members started to ask the Finance Director, Charles Noble, for an IT solution.At that moment in time, most of the company's sales information was being kept in spreadsheets which often led to lengthy delays in running standard reports or data queries. The management team knew that it would be much more constructive for their sales team to spend\u00a0more time focusing on offering their customers new products and better service, so they agreed that a Business Intelligence solution which provided easier and faster sales reporting was a priority requirement.As the management team had been specifically recruited from larger companies, they were all used to having a central repository of data where they could go to analyse information, and had experience of a number of different product solutions. They approached the market to see which products were available and, more importantly, which were the most appropriate for the size of their organisation. They explored a range of products, from bespoke solutions\u00a0through to a number of packages such as QlikView, Inca Software and IBM Cognos. They also considered not just the product on offer but the way in which it would be implemented.\"Out of all the different packages we approached with sample data\u00a0we chose Board as it was the one which felt was the most flexible, and that was probably the biggest selection criteria for us,\" comments Charles.The Board SolutionThe objectives of the initial implementation were as follows:Improve the ease and speed of forecasting and reporting processesReduce the need for/reliance on so many spreadsheetsImprove the quality of financial planning and management reportingAs New England Seafood need to be constantly aware of their margins, costs and product demand, their historical data had been kept in a large number of spreadsheets that were interconnected. Board has given them the ability to combine these spreadsheets with accounts information from their ERP and with careful project reviews throughout Phase one, Board is working well for them.Board impressed the team with clear user interfaces, lack of separation between planning and analysis functionality and the relative ease with which users could administer the system internally. \u00a0The company's forecast data is now input directly into Board by the sales team, with actuals such as costs and profit then interfaced from their ERP on a weekly basis too. This now means that they can analyse company profitability without searching through a large number of spreadsheets.Within the sales forecasting and reporting functions, the most important thing for New England Seafood has been the improvement in their ability to analyse their data. Previously, it was being analysed but there was an overeliance\u00a0on the intuition and experience of a number of key people within the team.\"We have now got a system that shines a light on all areas of the business, product profitability, trending of product lines etc. We also now have sales team members doing a lot more analysis themselves, safe in the knowledge that they are dealing with reliable data from one source.\" says Charles.Board's integration with Office has also helped New England Seafood team members to be more at ease with the Board solution. Charles has noted that people are starting to see the opportunities that the system can bring. They understand that their daily, weekly or monthly reporting tasks can be automated to make analysis quicker, easier and more reliable.As Board is an all-in-one toolkit, Charles believes that it is the ideal BI & CPM Solution to grow with New England Seafood;\"If someone had the same brief as us, I would definitely give Board a thumbs-up. My advice though would be to start simple, get to know the software and its capabilities and then grow as you go.\"Subsequent DevelopmentThe solution above went live in the summer of 2010 and immediately had a hugely positive impact on visibility of performance data. With the numbers now becoming available in a far shorter period of time, the commercial and finance teams at New England Seafood were able to turn their attention to getting behind the numbers, working out what was driving performance and then make better decisions on the back of this insightsWith the success of the Board solution now evident to other teams across the business, the Finance Director found himself being approached by teams around the business to see if the Board solution could be extended to help them in their areas of work. As a result, the second phase of the system implementation was conceived and the results have been astounding.As an area of focus, the Finance team opted to extend the system to allow for fully allocated, weekly product profitability data. They were conscious that there are many businesses that aim for this but, with the inevitable complexities that surround each business accounting method, many fail as these issues grind their development process to a halt.For New England Seafood, the key to navigating through the multitude of accounting complexities\u00a0lay in the flexibility of the Board solution.\"Each time we came up against an issue we could sit down with the development and project team to work it out. Each and every time the flexibility of the solution shone through,\" said Charles.Having now fully implemented the second phase of the project (which went live in November 2011) the team at New England Seafood are reaping the rewards of the system. Previously they, like many manufacturing businesses facing inflationary pressures, would review their profitability by examining the usual KPIs such as purchase price variance, but it was nearly impossible to show the effect this had at a product level without a sizeable off-line Excel exercise.Charles summarises the benefits of the Board solution:\"Before implementing the second phase of this project I would often hear two separate discussions in our management meetings. The first would be to highlight some negative variances such as purchase price or usage, and the second would then be about how well certain products were performing (albeit at a standard costing level, before the allocation of any variances). Even though the link is obvious and the resulting impact on REAL product profitability is a serious matter, the teams across the business had no way of drawing the two issues together.\u00a0By way of contrast, I am now hearing discussions on a weekly basis about REAL product profitability and most importantly the actions we need to take in order to improve profitability on specific products. It has been a revolutionary step in the way we run our business.\"The Future with BoardNew England Seafood is now close to implementing a third phase of the implementation which will provide full product costing capability within the Board solution (these are currently managed on Excel spreadsheets with a manual interface of data into the company's ERP system).\"We have now got a system that shines a light on all areas of the business, product profitability, trending of product lines etc. We also now have sales team members doing a lot more analysis themselves, safe in the knowledge that they are dealing with reliable data from one source.\" Charles Noble, Finance Director"

Its mission is to generate long-term value from the collection of milk from 3,560 dairy farms.The everyday work of LAITA's 2,500 employees is focused on ensuring customers' satisfaction across more than 110 countries.HQ in Brestseven industrial sites across western Francethree major activities: milk collection, milk transformation, and commercialization of dairy productsDifferent categories of products require differentiated yet intimately linked industrial processes and organizational systems: fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), dry ingredients (DI), health nutrition products and feed for young mammals. LAITA's Management Control team comprises about 20 management control specialists, divided between the company's headquarters and its various industrial sites. Three components determine the monthly operating result: commercial result, industrial result, and material result, each of which consists of the analytical records of one or more distinct legal entities. LAITA's scope of consolidation now includes 13 legal entities.The ContextThe dairy industry is a transformation and production industry that gives rise to a complex analytical structure, covering numerous production processes and nested and/or parallel processes.\u00a0The\u00a0multi-company, multi-process, and multi-product dimensions at LAITA each represent analysis axes fed by analytical data to enable detailed business monitoring. Despite this, management accounting and budget forecasting were conducted entity by entity, mostly using Excel. Similarly, the data on which the operating result was based was consolidated by various tools, including Excel. The over-reliance on Excel made it difficult to ensure the security of financial data as it created breaks in the company\u2019s audit trails. The customization and multiplication of files gave rise to a dependency link between their respective authors, adding complexity to the communication of management rules and the structure of the employees within the management control department. In parallel with this review of information systems, work started on compiling a management manual at the end of 2015 to simplify and harmonize LAITA's analytical structure as a whole.The ProjectUsed by the FMCG Commercial Management department since 2003, Board software was already successfully ensuring the reliability of commercial data. The Industry division also chose it for analyzing industrial performance, in line with the management needs of the business. LAITA wanted to equip the Finance function with a management accounting tool that would fulfill the functions of both simulation and budget processing and was looking for an integrator capable of implementing this new project.The SolutionBoard was again unanimously chosen for this transformation project. Within Commercial Management, the solution already enabled end-users to:Make precise, detailed use of commercial data, checked, furthermore, during integration with the Board platform and originating from different sources\u00a0(Trad\u00e9o, Ak\u00e9o, Stock Control).Dedicate more time to analysis and control tasks.Reduce overall processing time (improving controls and eliminating the need to re-enter data; cutting 2 to 3 days off the time previously taken to generate monthly results).The Industry division's new project encompasses 22 additional users for whom Board speeds up the production of reports, improves the traceability and comprehension of data, checks the accuracy of calculations, and ensures data integrity in accordance with the established rules. The analytical structures are now aligned. This new application establishes the rules for consolidating the operating result, enabling cross-analysis of financial data and ensuring that practices are kept uniform and information is not duplicated. Board serves the economic management needs of the business - which are complex because they are multi-axis - while at the same time remaining agile and flexible to facilitate data consolidation and forecasting the future development of LAITA (replicable structure, development of project view, adjustment of management accounting entries, integration of new industrial processes or new products, etc.). The project in progress also shifts the focus of Management Control onto activities delivering higher added value: financial data analysis (including alerting, identification of performance levers, projections of financial indicators, and calculation of selling prices."

        "title": "Spirits Platform case study",
        "company": "Spirits Platform",
        "content": "Spirits Platform is an Australian sales, marketing, and distribution platform focused on premium spirits brands. Formed in 2015 by a group of highly experienced industry veterans following the merger of Suntory Australia and Beam, the company is driven by its vision to provide the focus, expertise, and brand support necessary for premium spirits to succeed in Australia\u2019s crowded market. A highly experienced management team leads Spirits Platform with almost 100 years of experience in the liquor industry.Capturing a 3% share of the spirits market in Australia, Spirits Platform has established a strong reputation in the liquor market in the two years since its inception. Its impressive brand portfolio includes well-known premium brands such as Cointreau, Licor 43, Macallan, The Famous Grouse, Tia Maria, Sierra Tequila, Chartreuse, Opal Nera, Zubrowka Vodka, Mozart, Remy Martin, and Louis XIII Cognac.Business requirementsAs a newly formed company with strong growth ambitions, Spirits Platform needed to establish scalable systems and processes to enable its operations, systems that needed to support a primary mobile workforce, and geographically dispersed teams.Specifically, Spirits Platform wanted to maintain a lean workforce; it simply did not have the resources for heavily technical solutions or number crunching in inefficient spreadsheet regimes. David Moore, Director at Spirits Platform, notes:I knew that going back to spreadsheets would have set the new business back. It would have imposed a bottleneck on the businesses ability to change rapidly without reliance on expensive external consulting. I had also witnessed heavily technical solutions like Cognos in a prior business. On this occasion, we selected Board and it addressed Excel\u2019s inadequacies, cut the technical reliance, and gave us the self-sufficiency we were seeking. I would even say Board contributed to the company\u2019s growth in a then overall falling market. So naturally I wanted a fast start in the new company \u2013 it\u2019s survival was at stake.Additionally, as a distributor with no direct visibility into end customer purchases or trends, Spirits Platform relies on data from bottle shops, clubs, hotels, and retailers to understand sales, inventory, and market trends. Vital market and customer performance data had to be incorporated into the budgeting process. Without this, forecasts were out of touch with market realities. In this context, a robust business intelligence system that integrates data from various sources was necessary to achieve accurate forecasting, budgeting, and planning. Intelligent planning tools and business analytics were therefore crucial for Spirits Platform to pave a sustainable path toward revenue growth.The solutionSpirits Platform immediately set out to implement a business intelligence tool. It needed to achieve integration with this vital sales data and leverage forecasting capabilities if it was to launch successfully into the Australian Market. The company had precise requirements for a fast and cost-effective implementation within a suitable price range for a fledgling organization. David Moore approached a Board partner for advice and assistance in building the new systems to the company\u2019s requirements. He adds:We immediately turned to a partner because we had had a great experience with them previously. We had partnered before, so we knew the quality of the organisation. With their ability to be flexible with us in both timeline and budget, it was a no-brainer reigniting the relationship.The partner recommended a corporate performance reporting solution with solid business intelligence capabilities to integrate Spirit Platform\u2019s planning, budgeting, forecasting, analysis, and reporting in a single tool.To meet the imperatives of speed, cost, and mobility, the partner advised Board Intelligent Planning Platform. This would ensure the fastest time to deployment and avoid the hardware costs associated with on-premise implementation. David Moore states:\u00a0From the time we got the green light we only had a nine-week period to set the company up and start trading. We spoke to the Partner and outlined the challenge. They got all the basics done in time, and then working together we completed all our core systems within six months.Project #1: Budgeting & forecastingSpirits Platform and the Partner took a steady and sequential approach to implementation, focusing on simplicity. Rather than overwhelming users with too many reports or features, the approach focused on progressively introducing functionality based on benefits in response to specific business needs.Within weeks a budget and forecasting tool was rapidly implemented alongside initial business intelligence capabilities.Board delivered an immediate outset of a 70% or more reduction in the resources (people, time, effort, etc) required to build a budget and subsequent monthly forecast. Board also delivered a rolling 12-month budget, enabled comparisons between budgets and forecasts, and provided vital What-If budget and forecast analyses on the fly. A drill-through capability from the summary level to individual transactions was essential. The system also fostered consistency in market and customer performance data and provided insightful management reports. David Moore adds:We are removing the majority of spreadsheets and the replication of data across the business. That\u2019s where we will leverage the value and see a fast ROI on the system.Project #2: Intelligent PlanningThe next immediate phase was to leverage the inherent Board Intelligent and analytics features over the data. By capturing, integrating, and analyzing data from multiple internal and external sources, Board has enabled Spirits Platform to overcome the challenge of distance from the end consumer, ensuring a full and accurate view of company operations. In turn, the management team has achieved an in-depth understanding of business operations and performance, which has driven better decision-making. This insight and data immediately improve budgeting and forecasting, either as key driver data generating financial results and scenarios or adding context and insight to planners\u2019 decision-making.Benefits realized from the Board solution include:The ability to segment customers by profitability supports the lean sales organization. This results in much more effective targeting of minimal resources, including assigned brand ambassadors to build deeper affiliations with key clients.All sales and marketing activity is thoroughly analyzed and measured, enabling team members to identify, analyze and understand the effectiveness of commercial trading investment and other such activities at any time.The depth, quality, and speed of business information are paying off in agility, which can be seen in Spirits Platform's speed to market and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances swiftly.The accessibility of new systems ensures that mobile and remote staff can connect and securely conduct business from anywhere in the world.Project #3: Supply chain integration and predictive analyticsOnce 12 months of trading had been completed, Spirits Platform and the Partner shifted focus to enabling the business intelligence automation and predictive analytics capabilities of Board, intending to improve cash flow management by streamlining purchasing and inventory management and increasing sales forecasting accuracy.These vital processes had previously remained in separate spreadsheet systems. Staff relied heavily on manual tasks to manage data outputs which were both time-consuming and carried a high risk of manual error. In addition, the company\u2019s Sales Plan was disconnected from procurement, which led to issues with stock planning and decision-making.Lastly, with geographically dispersed staff, teams within Spirits Platform were struggling to share information and collaborate quickly. David Moore explains:We are a smaller player in the Australian liquor industry and simply do not have the depth of pocket of the larger players to spend on big marketing and sales programs and hold excess inventory. However, we can be agile in what we bring to market and in how we innovate. To underpin this, it is critical to be able to measure the ROI on any investment and we must have systems that can provide us the insight to make quick but informed decisions and best manage our resources.To address this, Board was extended rapidly, and spreadsheets were removed. Board now seamlessly leverages key ERP data, rolls weekly forecasts, and synthesizes predictive forecasts with sales team inputs, generating purchase recommendations and optimizing inventory.\u00a0The automation of the Daily Inventory Report alone allowed\u00a0Spirits Platform\u00a0the potential to identify stock issues up to three weeks earlier than previously possible. By combining insights from sales history with the customer demand plans,\u00a0Spirits Platform can now target missing demand, further driving up revenue.The ability to analyze actuals and forecasts as a live comparison has been revolutionary for the company, as David Moore notes:Cash flow management is critical and inventory is one of our largest cash impacts. Our discussions are now more robust since being able to compare and contrast against the forecast created by the sales team. We\u2019ve also moved to daily system Board alerts of inventory levels. With stock purchase lead times of up to 10 weeks we were holding too much inventory just-in-case it was needed. This excess is now being eliminated.A platform for self-sufficiencyThroughout projects, Spirits Platform and the partner mutually focused on ensuring an effective handover of knowledge to enable in-house staff to manage the tool without excessive reliance on external consultants. The Spirits Platform team learned to use and manage the tool with ease. Furthermore, by using cloud solutions, Spirits Platform has avoided the need to employ in-house IT expertise.Board has proven scalable, flexible, and capable of meeting Spirits Platform\u2019s needs. By unlocking additional functionality within the Board software (sales, budgeting & forecasting, and procurement planning), Spirits Platform has a richer picture of its business operations and performance. Different information from various source systems is integrated into a single place, improving the quality of data insights and enabling the company to undertake more focused analyses. As a result, the company\u2019s budgeting, forecasting, and planning processes are now three to four weeks faster than before the implementation.From a user perspective, Spirits Platform staff are no longer reliant on Excel to undertake the planning. There is a clear and effective integration between inventory planning and sales planning, which has enabled the company to be proactive in responding to or engaging with the market. For example, Spirits Platform can react in advance to demand changes or unexpected sales and events. There has been a noticeable shift in conversations from focusing on what occurred in the past to strategizing what steps should be taken next to respond to current events.Significantly, integrating critical operational data in a single source system has improved communication between teams, enabling them to speak in a common language and achieve a shared understanding of business performance. Team collaboration, as well as data confidence across teams, has significantly improved.The solutions enabled Spirits Platform to analyze company, partner, and market data, anticipate trends, and develop appropriate sales, marketing, and supply chain strategies.\u00a0"

        "title": "Taylors Wines case study",
        "company": "Taylors Wines",
        "content": "Taylors Wines is a family-owned winery that has been crafting great Australian wines in the Clare Valley, South Australia, for three generations.\u00a0Taylors Wines wanted to become a more data-driven business, making a greater amount of information available to its management, sales, marketing and finance teams - wherever they happened to be working.\u00a0Taylors Wines was running its business off just three reports: a direct sales report updated daily, a monthly P&L, and a static PDF produced monthly for its area sales team.\u00a0All the reports had limitations: the direct sales and P&L reports could only be interrogated by finance, meaning many emails from people trying to understand what data sat behind the results in front of them. The static PDF report, meanwhile, was hard to read on iPads used by the area sales team.\u00a0\u201cFinance was spending so much time creating reports rather than analysing them,\u201d finance manager Hamza Jinwala says.\u00a0\u201cOur main goal was to make information available to people on the go, as and when they need it, without relying on us. Instead of relying on a sales analyst or finance team members if and when they wanted to get the information, we wanted to let them just go and get the information themselves.In addition, the reports were not visually appealing; the tool used to produce them was Excel-based\u00a0\u00a0The business had aspirations to become more data-driven: to use data to grow sales in the stores, restaurants and bars that stock Taylors Wines; to better understand demand and use that to manage stock levels and production; to measure the impact of winning international wine competitions on sales; and to accurately track rebates it paid out to customers.\u00a0\u00a0The SolutionIn 2013, Taylors Wines selected and deployed Board as its new reporting tool.\u00a0\u00a0It primarily runs on top of Taylors Wines\u2019 data warehouse though it also links directly to other internal data sources such as customer relationship management (CRM) and various Excel worksheets.\u00a0Initially, the company decided to simply replicate the reports it already had while improving them from a data visualisation and remote access perspective.\u00a0\u201cBut when we saw the product and what it could do, we started realizing more of its potential,\u201d Jinwala says.\u00a0The BenefitsFive years later, Taylors Wines has increased the number of reports it produces from three to over 100, unlocking latent demand for data and value for the organisation. Board\u2019s reliability and flexibility quickly became a catalyst for change in the way Taylors Wines tracked its success.\u00a0\u201cAbout six months after we implemented Board, we had a sales restructure where we redesigned the KPIs for our area managers,\u201d Jinwala says.\u00a0\u00a0Where area managers were previously only measured on revenue, now they also use Board to track who sells what ranges and brands, where they are running in-store promotions and retail displays, and other metrics. They use Board to identify gaps, opportunities and to create a shortlist of customers to visit. These are all new capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIn the previous world, we didn\u2019t have the same measures because we knew they would be very difficult to track and report on a frequent basis,\u201d Jinwala says. \u201cIn the new world with Board, we knew we could have a dashboard and get the information updated to them every week or more frequently if we wanted to.\u201d\u00a0Long-term profitability and stock levels can also be easily measured.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to create a long-term forecasting model whereby we can actually look at what our profit is going to look like for the next five years, and based on that we can discuss what sort of initiatives we\u2019re able to afford in the future,\u201d Jinwala says.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe also used to hold quite a bit of safety stock just so we didn\u2019t run out, but now with Board we are producing weekly forecasts that are fed into the production planning schedules so they can be changed to avoid running out of stock and losing sales.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Board makes it easier to reliably check rebate claims filed by customers.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve got hundreds of customers who would send in their rebate claims. We wouldn\u2019t even bother checking whether they were correct because there was no source to check them against. Now we just go into Board and look at whether the claim is valid or not,\u201d Jinwala says.\u00a0Another major benefit of Board is that Taylors Wines can see how winning wine medals and displaying these on its bottles impacts sales. Prior to Board, the impact on sales was completely unknown.\u201cDepending on the type of medal and prestige of the competition, we\u2019ve seen a 15 to 20 percent increase in sales on bottles with more than two medals on the label,\u201d Jinwala says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know this before or even enter that many wine shows, but as we\u2019ve started tracking the sales uplift via Board, we\u2019ve been able to enter more wine shows and win more awards.\u201d\u00a0Board occupies a critical place in Taylors Wines\u2019 operations.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just simple things we now take for granted. From a company perspective it was a great decision to deploy Board because we were able to become more efficient and achieve cost savings. And because everyone is so much more self-sufficient, the finance team is now free to concentrate on bigger and better things,\u201d Jinwala adds.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

        "company": "RUNGIS express GmbH",
        "content": "RUNGIS express GmbH is one of the largest premium ultra-fresh food suppliers to German hotels, restaurants, and caterers. With over 45 years of experience, it is an established brand known for well-founded food competence, support oriented to individual customer needs, and trusted, long-term partnerships.The challenge: Accelerate fact-based decision makingRUNGIS express GmbH was using Excel and a range of smaller tools from its ERP program to manage Sales & Operations Planning and reporting. This legacy approach was disconnected and unintuitive, creating inaccuracies that led to numerous problems, especially when dealing with ultra-fresh produce. Reporting was also cumbersome and time-consuming.Thomas Bartmann, Business Intelligence Analyst at RUNGIS express GmbH recalled the challenges the organization faced:\u201cToo often, the required information reached the responsible persons too late. This slowed down the management of the company and delayed necessary decisions. The pressure was on to act much more rapidly in our fast-moving business.\u201dA study from the Business Applications Research Centre (BARC) was the starting point in the search for a suitable software solution. Four providers were eventually shortlisted, with the Board Intelligent Planning Platform coming out on top. Board was selected based on its appealing user interface, intuitive operation, and, above all, the ability for RUNGIS express GmbH to administrate the software and develop applications independently.The solution: Intelligent Planning that perfectly supports sales and procurementBoard's Intelligent Planning Platform quickly proved to be the right fit for R express\u2019 Sales & Operations activities. With the solution in place, planning, analysis, and reporting are closely linked, and applications can be developed using Board\u2019s code-free interface without external help.\"I'm not an IT expert,\" said Bartmann. \"But it was no problem at all to familiarize myself with Board and create my own applications. If I'm really faced with a tricky task, I get quick help from Board Support. Or, I visit the Board user community where there is so much expertise willingly shared. It\u2019s a great place where you benefit from the experiences users in other companies have already had.\"Bartmann provided an example to illustrate how easy and intuitive it is to work with Board:\"Our CFO puts together his own dashboards swiftly and easily. He knows best what information he needs and doesn't have to specify his requirements or explain to someone else what he is looking for.\u201dBoard is used at R express\u2019s operational sales controlling level as much as it is for strategic procurement planning. The platform primarily supports the sales team in the acquisition and support of customers and the procurement function in purchasing. Board automatically loads transaction data from the ERP system and invoice data from the accounting system. Text-based customer and prospect information from the CRM system is incorporated, making it easy for the sales team to acquire new customers and develop existing ones.\"Every customer manager immediately sees their customers\u2019 results and always knows where they stand. This increases transparency. Since they can analyze their figures in self-service mode, they are able to react to their customers' buying behavior at any time,\" said Bartmann. \"The goal is to keep customers as long-term partners of the business.\"The procurement team at RUNGIS express GmbH faces very specific challenges. The company makes about 60% of its sales from ultra-fresh products, such as fish and seafood that are caught fresh every day. According to the catch, the availability and price of the products changes very quickly, sometimes even hourly. Margin planning in Board enables the procurement team to react quickly and flexibly in this environment.\"Sales triggers procurement according to customers' orders with a lead time of a few days. Procurement confirms quantities and prices while permanently monitoring the markets. The data flows into Board and is then also visible to sales. Depending on prices and available quantities, the sales department can react quickly in consultation with its customers and, for example, increase quantities when prices are favorable. Conversely, managers can offer customers alternative products if prices rise or goods are only available in limited quantities. This service is something that customers really appreciate and we were not able to provide it so effortlessly before Board,\" said Bartmann.Logistics planning in Board is also currently being implemented: \"This is a project that will take us a significant step forward. Optimal route planning, but also the planning of the quantities to be transported, will make us even more efficient and will help us save costs.\"Benefits: Faster processes, better control, and higher marginsAround 100 of R express' 700 employees are using Board. Since all important numbers are available at the push of a button, Board brings a high level of transparency to orders and forms the basis for close, trusted cooperation with customers.\"The HORECA sector suffered heavily from the Coronavirus pandemic. This was also a tough time for us because these were our customers. Board helped us to successfully ramp up the business again after the lockdowns and restrictions. We were able to see exactly which regions and segments were picking up again and react in a targeted way,\" reported Bartmann. \"This gave us a head start on the competition.\"Sales reports on each individual customer illustrate precisely which products and quantity were ordered. This enables the sales team to provide customers with even more targeted support and helps to steer the business better.\"We have managed, with the help of Board's insights, to significantly increase the quantity per order and optimize delivery. We were able to reduce spoilage and improve our pricing. All this means that we have been able to improve our gross profit margin by 2-3% without screwing prices and despite the difficult business environment,\" concludes Bartmann."

        "content": "The Company\u00a0\u00a0Hillbrook\u00a0is a co-educational Anglican secondary school with an innovative and refreshing approach to education. Established almost thirty years ago, the school provides an academic education that empowers students to go on to live confident, capable, sensitive and creative lives in the global community; through its motto, In Balance\u00a0We Grow.\u00a0There are 720 students, taught by 70 teachers, who in turn are supported by 30 administrative staff.\u00a0 Places at\u00a0Hillbrook\u00a0are highly sought after with many parents enrolling their children at birth and most before commencing Prep. As a\u00a0result of\u00a0the school currently has enrolments stretching out to 2028.\u00a0The\u00a0Challenge Understanding the business of educationTwo years ago,\u00a0Hillbrook\u00a0Business Manager, David Briggs and Finance Manager, Bronwyn Wearne, identified an opportunity to build a better understanding of the school's business and its community.\u00a0They decided to introduce a professional analytics and business intelligence platform that would allow\u00a0Hillbrook's\u00a0management and School Board to look more deeply into school operations to learn more about costs, profitability, enrolments and other crucial aspects of school management.\u00a0 The insights would be used to help build\u00a0Hillbrook's\u00a0roadmap for the future, understand the financial impact of these decisions, and identify and mitigate risks along the way.\u00a0The\u00a0Solution\u00a0\u00a0A business-class toll that\u2019s easy to use\u00a0\u00a0The pair selected Board, one of the world's leading business intelligence toolsets, as the basis for\u00a0Hillbrook's\u00a0new analytic capabilities.\u00a0\u201cThe selection of Board was a happy accident,\u201d Briggs notes.\u00a0 \u201cBronwyn and I had been to a budget workshop at the Institute of Chartered Accountants where a Board Partner did a presentation of Board, and the software and its applications looked good.\u201d\u00a0After reviewing product research from firms such as Gartner, it was clear Board was highly rated among those in the know, so Briggs contacted the partner to learn more.\u00a0\u201cWe didn't have any specific requirements in mind other than usability,\u201d Briggs adds. \u201cWe wanted something that in time, we would be able to develop ourselves. Board seemed to offer that.\u201d\u00a0The\u00a0Benefits\u00a0\u00a0The first project identified by Briggs and Wearne was \u201cContribution to Surplus\u201d. This involved analysing costs and \u2018surplus contribution\u2019 of each school subject area and each year level.\u00a0\u00a0Briggs explains,\u201cWhile some of this information comes down to the number of students in a class and the frequency of the class, there are other factors involved.\u00a0 Our intention was to understand where the surplus components come from.\u201d\u00a0Wearne worked closely with the Board Partners consultants as the Contribution to Surplus model was developed in Board. \u201cThe Partner helped assess the project and developed the scope.\u00a0 There was some to-and-fro with the developer, then the developer came in for a week and after that, it was finished,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u00a0It was a painless and trouble-free development that took just a couple of months from beginning to end.\u00a0 \u201cThe project has brought our understanding of the contribution to surplus to a new level,\u201d Briggs asserts. Knowledge about surplus breakdown is helping to provide a better context for budget processes.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUltimately, the school is all about providing good teaching and learning.\u00a0 We don't want the financials to dictate anything\u00a0particularly\u00a0but the information does help us to find balance in budgeting.\u00a0 And that certainly makes it worthwhile. It is always useful to have a better understanding of financial dynamics and Board has helped the School achieve this improved level of knowledge\u201d.\u00a0Turning to enrolments\u00a0With the first project completed, Briggs and Wearne turned their attention to the school's enrolment data. Despite the current favourable pipeline of enrolments, the two were determined not to take future demand for granted. Therefore, they wanted to analyse current enrolments, demographic information, sibling enrolments, enrolment lapsed time data, and more.\u00a0\u201cSchools are pretty dynamic businesses and one of the risks for independent schools is a complacency about enrolments,\u201d Briggs states.\u00a0 \u201cIt's important to ensure future prosperity by understanding enrolment patterns. For example, the 720 students enrolled at\u00a0Hillbrook\u00a0right now, live in about 70 different suburbs, so they are\u00a0pretty widespread.\u00a0 That's a positive thing in one way, because if there is any major shift in demographics for one\u00a0particular area, some risks are mitigated.\u00a0 But we still need to know where future enrolments might come from and to identify as best we can, when and why parents are enrolling\u201d\u00a0\u201cWe have thousands and thousands of records and pieces of information about our enrolments.\u00a0 But until we assemble those records in some cognitive designed way, we can't really see a story. And what we wanted was to look for stories that help describe the data in different ways.\u00a0 It was a bit of a fishing expedition for us,\u201d he continues.\u00a0Once again, working with the Partner, a Board model was designed to draw on critical data sets contained in the school's TASS software system.\u00a0 The team spent time working out how best to bring together disparate types of data and to present the outcomes for useful analysis.\u00a0\u201cWork on the enrolment model was carried out in among our normal operations.\u00a0 We started on it in late 2014 and finished early this year,\u201d Wearne states. \u201cWe've been using it for enrolments for about three months and find it acts as an add-on to help us quickly review a lot of data in different reports that are not available from our main software system.\u201d\u00a0It helps to have a guiding hand\u00a0Wearne and Briggs now have one final Board project to complete.\u00a0 In the coming months, they plan to create a budgeting module that will simplify budget preparation and reporting, making the process more efficient.\u00a0Throughout the project, the Partner will continue the program of knowledge transfer that is enabling Hillbrook staff to take more and more control over their Business Intelligence platform.\u00a0\u201cThe ability to bring the system along\u00a0ourselves\u00a0has always been important,\u201d Wearne admits.\u00a0 \u201cThe more we use it, the more ideas we have about what we'd like it to do.\u201d\u00a0Intelligent Planning as a competitive tool\u00a0Briggs adds, \u201cThe business of schools has become very competitive, and risk mitigation and administration are becoming a lot more sophisticated. When we decided to invest in an analytical tool, it wasn't because anything was wrong but because we realised we had a whole lot of information available that we needed to better understand.\u00a0 With the help of the Partner and Board, we are just starting to sit down and analyse it all now.\u201d\u00a0I think it's fair to say that the Partner are a pretty intuitive bunch.\u00a0 It wasn't really definite in our own minds where we were heading with this analytic capability.\u00a0 We had a rough idea, but they worked it out with us pretty quickly. They definitely helped shape the design for us and have responded well to our needs,\u201d he concludes.\u00a0"

        "content": "United Energy provides a safe and reliable energy supply to residents across the eastern areas of Melbourne and the Mornington Peninsula.Headquartered in Melbourne, United Energy and Multinet Gas employ more than 300 people throughout their service region. While UE and UG are separate businesses with different boards of directors and ownership structures, they are managed by the same head office. The combined UEMG management subscribes to shared values of safety, accountability, collaboration, communication, empowerment, and respect, which guide their executives and staff in everything they do.The ChallengesFinancial reporting within UE and MG was performed by a combination of SAP reports, a legacy BI warehouse solution and many Excel spreadsheets.\u00a0This time-consuming process required a great deal of manual intervention and checking by the company's financial staff each month.\u00a0 It typically took between three and four days to produce the end of month P&L, balance sheet and cost centre reports.\u00a0 And any late postings or manual adjustments delayed the process further because they required a full run of the entire process.The Search for a SolutionRecognizing that this complex, error-prone and time-consuming reporting process needed to change, UEMG turned to the global analyst firm Gartner for recommendations. They first examined the annual Gartner BI and Analytics Magic Quadrant report, which annually subdivides the leading vendors\u2019 expertise by functional strengths.\u00a0UEMG recognized quickly that the Tier One vendors listed in Gartner\u2019s MQ would require long, drawn-out and costly projects that would be overkill for what was required.\u00a0\u00a0UEMG sought straight-forward financial reporting (P&L, balance sheet and cost centre reports) for each company plus the option to extend the system to accommodate budget and planning in the future.Returning to Gartner, UEMG examined the specialty vendors listed in the MQ report as the best solutions for specific dilemmas such as theirs.\u00a0They quickly recognized that Board International and three other vendors were better suited to help them overcome their data integration, consolidation and reporting challenges than the top tier vendors.\u00a0A subsequent Proof-of-Concept evaluation conducted with all four vendors showed UEMG that Board would best meet their requirements for SAP integration and ease of use for the companies\u2019 financial staff.Implementing the SolutionThe project of implementing the Board platform was driven by the finance department and funded by the IT department.\u00a0Initial implementation took only 30 days, followed by another month of parallel running before Board was put into full production.\u00a0During the first month, the SAP connector and server environment was set up and account structures such as GL accounts, cost centres (including hierarchies) and reporting formats were loaded into Board.Board then enabled creation of basic reports, such as P&L, balance sheet, and cost centre reports. The first of these was done by Board consultants, while the balance sheet and cost centre reports were developed by UEMG Finance users on their own.Functional BenefitsThe time to extract data was greatly reduced due to Board's integration with existing SAP queries and reports, allowing Finance staff to create variants in SAP to extract the required data.\u00a0UEMG Finance staff can now\u00a0easily create ad hoc reports\u00a0instantly in order to further analyze their data.Initially Board was used for basic reporting against budget and forecasts, with that data uploaded from spreadsheets.\u00a0However, by the 2014-2015 financial year, the cost centre forecasts were entered directly into Board,\u00a0saving time, the double handling of data, and reducing errors, thus enabling forecast totals to be made available immediately.Organisational BenefitsBoard was implemented with minimal involvement from the IT department, allowing Finance to become self-sufficient for their reporting needs. The Board implementation has\u00a0significantly reduced the hours required to produce month-end reports.\u00a0In particular, the cash flow report alone has\u00a0saved half a day per month of manual production and error checking.\u00a0The\u00a0quicker and more accurate production of financial reports\u00a0has enabled asset owners and senior management to\u00a0make informed decisions in a more timely manner.ConclusionFrom UEMG IT\u2019s perspective, the Board project came in on-time and under budget. The Board platform improved the time taken to extract data from SAP and reduced the reliance on IT resources to extract SAP data.From the Finance department\u2019s point of view, financial reports from Board were up and running within two months, which was a big win for the business.\u00a0To be\u00a0able to create a report requested by the CFO within minutes\u00a0was another plus for Board.In summary, Board has been a success for UEMG.\u00a0The outcomes of the Board implementations clearly show that the needs of the organization have been met, and the success of the Board platform for Finance has prompted UEMG to expand the solution into other business departments.\u201cSince we implemented the Board platform, we have seen a quantum improvement in the speed and flexibility of our reporting. We are now much better placed to manage our business.\u201d Chief Financial Officer, United Energy."

The faithbased organisation administers over 70 community service programs across 30 locations. These include residential services for older people, transitional housing for people seeking asylum, foster care, family, children and youth services, and mental health services.Baptcare receives most of its funding from federal and state governments. In 2014/15, the organisation received $150m in revenue, with 80% spent on service delivery.Business Challenges Baptcare\u2019s top priority is delivering high-quality programs and services to older people, children, families, people with a disability, financially disadvantaged people, and people seeking asylum. Accurate budgeting, forecasting and reporting are essential for ensuring these valuable services continue.Baptcare\u2019s 1700 employees cost and monitor every project to ensure budgets stay on target. Variances are identified and accounted for as early as possible, and funding bodies for each program are kept up-to-date with regular, in-depth reports.However, by 2014, Baptcare had outgrown its budgeting and forecasting platform. It was about to lose support from the developer and lacked transparency, which meant employees did not understand or trust the numbers produced.The platform didn\u2019t have all the capabilities that the growing not-for-profit required for financial visibility.Baptcare sought a new tool to make budgeting and forecasting faster and more accurate. Unlike its predecessors, the solution needed to be scalable, flexible and allow employees to:Create multiple budgets and forecasts across any range of monthsBudget using either a detailed bottom-up process or top-down approachTake\u00a0into account complex awards and allowances\u00a0when budgeting and forecasting payrollBuild a transparent budget frameworkProduce complex reports without IT supportSpecifically, we wanted a solution that could grow and be quite flexible for us. We don\u2019t do just one element of aged care. We operate in quite diverse areas. We went into this change with a very open mind in that we didn\u2019t want to simply replicate what we had. We wanted to find the best way of budgeting and forecasting.\u201d \u200b\u2013Tammy Campbell, Senior Finance Business PartnerThe Solution Baptcare engaged a partner for a budgeting and forecasting solution. As one of Australia\u2019s leading technology solution providers, Baptcare trusted the partner to deliver a cost-effective, value-adding project that would support its mission and vision.The partner recommended Baptcare implement Board, the Intelligent Platform for budgeting, forecasting, planning, and analytics. In addition to being flexible and user-friendly, Board eliminated the need for separate planning applications and analytics tools \u2013 helping Baptcare\u2019s IT budget go further.The Board solution provided:Dynamic online budgeting and forecasting across the organisationSupport for complex calculation rules and assumptions to accurately model future revenueManagement of complex planning areas, including:Capital expenditureBudgeting across multiple cost centres using varying capitalisation dates, depreciation methods and asset classesAllocations based on percentage of revenue, number of FTEs and occupancyIntegration with Microsoft Dynamics AXThe Board solution introduced a detailed Human Resources section, incorporating hourly rates by shift and multiple shift allowances. These new capabilities allowed finance to assist the business to:Calculate pay increases, bonuses and leave loadingsSplit staff across multiple cost centresAccount for variations in working hours, such as when an employee takes maternity leaveFuture PlansIntegration with Baptcare\u2019s CRM and payroll systems, to provide a single, holistic view of business performanceSelf-service financial reporting and analytics, including visualisations and dashboards, to provide instant access to income statements, balance sheets and cash flow projectsRolling forecasts to reduce budget preparation efforts, while also improving forecast accuracyOther than the time savings, the big change for us has been user confidence in the system.

Now everyone can drill down quite easily and see how the numbers are derived.\u201d\u00a0 \u2013Tammy Campbell,\u00a0Senior Finance Business PartnerWe liked the transparency inherent in the forecasts and the demonstration opened our eyes to how flexible the design could be.

Maritime, one of the world\u2019s leading ship owners and operators in the chemical/product tanker and dry bulk space, to support internal and external reporting, intra-group consolidation, and financial forecasting activities.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Board, a unified decision-making platform which combines analysis, simulation, planning, and forecasting, will help M.T. Maritime drive digital transformation of its processes and improve performance.\u00a0Having grown its fleet of vessels significantly over the past 5 years and given the complexity of the global business, M.T. Maritime was looking for a more tailored system approach in terms of financial forecasting and managing foreign exchange, interest rate, and bunker price risk. Simultaneously, the company was also looking for a tool to enhance reporting quality to match both internal and customer expectations for excellence and financial reliability.\u00a0\u201cShipping is an enormously complex business in a constantly changing global environment. In order to manage the business we need to be able to not only efficiently analyze volumes of data coming from each of our owned and managed vessels every single day, but also take into account constantly changing prices for a range of commodities, as well as foreign exchange and interest rate movements. This data is then fed into complex financial models that are used for both retroactive reports and forecasts, which are crucial for senior management and our worldwide Operations, Chartering, and Finance teams,\u201dshares Christoph Clauss, Chief Financial Officer at M.T. Maritime.\u201cUntil now, we managed a lot of this via Excel. However, given the growth and size of our company today, the amount of work and resources necessary to create tailored reports and \u2019what-if\u2019 scenarios at short notice is immense, especially if the prerequisite is to maintain, source, and collate data from a variety of large spreadsheets first, while keeping the error rate to a minimum. Very often you also have \u2018key man risks\u2019 involved that need to be considered in these operations,\u201dChristoph continues.The team at M.T. Maritime chose the Board decision-making platform for its well-crafted design, intuitive interface, and its ability to automate calculations and output reports. Additionally, as a global company, the ability for M.T. Maritime to run macro-economic what-if scenarios using Board is a huge asset.\u00a0\u201cWe are confident that using a fully tested and freely adaptable financial forecasting and analysis system like Board will make the process of transferring data between different databases much more efficient. It should also increase the reliability and ease of creating reports and forecasts for individual data sub-sets, scenarios, and time periods on an ad-hoc basis. To have this kind of infrastructure will enable us to take even better advantage of changes and opportunities in the global marketplace,\u201dChristoph concludes.\u201cWe are very happy to have M.T. Maritime Group select Board to assist in their financial transformation.\u00a0 Decision making has never been more important than it is today.\u00a0 The goal to make critical business decisions in real time is something we are pleased to assist M.T.

The intuitive and programming-free toolkit within the Board platform fosters self-service implementation.Kneipp, one of Germany's best-known manufacturers of well-being and healthcare products made from natural ingredients, has a vision: to implement the entire reporting system for all the company's user groups on a single software platform. The company also wants to use the same tool to control and manage all its planning processes: \u201c With an integrated solution for all the application areas of analysis, planning and reporting, we want to put an end to the constant media disruptions and unnecessary process and approval cycles. By pooling and processing all our data and information into a single system, we hope to see a significant increase in efficiency, quality and transparency,\u00a0\" explains Frank Titus, Chief Financial Officer at Kneipp.One software, one company, one solution :During the software selection process, it quickly became clear to Kneipp that there are only a few tools on the market that truly and seamlessly combine the worlds of Business Intelligence and Corporate Performance Management. \" Unlike most solutions on the market, the All-in-one platform, Board, is not a maze of different, more or less well interfused modules or purchased add-on products, but a fully developed solution that's constantly growing as one unit. That explains the high quality of the product \u2013 a crucial factor in our decision to go with Board,\u00a0\" explains Christine Vogel, Organizational Project Manager at Kneipp.The first step involves creating and compiling reports in Board for the departments of Sales, Controlling, Logistics and Purchasing. The reporting for more specialist areas will follow gradually after that, then a Management Information System. After this first phase, Kneipp will tackle the implementation of planning in Board. Based on its sales planning, the company wants to build other areas up gradually, ending up with a comprehensive and integrated business planning system with workflows and clean approval processes.Quick fit thanks to self-service BI and CPM in the coaching process :Implementation is carried out under the coaching process, with each department training a key user to create reports or applications for their department themselves. A handful of IT department employees will also be trained to attach the new data. At the beginning, experienced Board consultants will support Kneipp in the implementation phase, but the idea is that they will gradually withdraw to allow Kneipp to take on the further development independently. \" We went for the self-service approach in the coaching process to quickly get to grips with the new software. We want to develop our BI and CPM solution independently, without external advice \u2013 that will allow us to implement an agile and cost-efficient system,\" explains Matthias H\u00e4u\u00dfler, Project Manager at Kneipp.An internal committee consisting of key users, as well as a style guide and a future KPI catalog will ensure compliance with quality requirements. \u00a0\u00a0About Kneipp :For more than 125 years, this traditional name stands for effective, innovative and natural health and well-being products based on the holistic teachings of Sebastian Kneipp. Naturopathic competence and pharmaceutical experience, state-of-the-art production methods and intricate scientific controls have guaranteed the proven quality of Kneipp products over the generations.
