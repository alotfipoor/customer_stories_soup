        "company": "Ineos inovyn",
        "content": " Ineos Inovyn\u2019s transformation journey for fixed costs. Inovyn had over 700 million fixed costs in its SAP systems that were manually managed. Previously, each month each local controller had to manually extract fixed costs from SAP into Excel and prepare submission files for reporting. Each country also had their own SQL or Access databases.  Forecasting was executed in Excel but involved copying and pasting of data to prepare submissions for around 50 legal entities. Having actual and forecast data gathered in the same report was also a cumbersome and complex process that could only be performed by very few staff. The solution, implemented with support from Agilos as a strategic partner, consists of a change data capture replication process for SAP ERP systems into a cloud data platform. The platform is designed to have a Raw Data Landing Zone and a Data Warehouse Zone, handled by Qlik Replicate and Qlik Compose respectively. The use of pre-built SAP accelerators (Order-to-Cash, Financial Analytics and Inventory Management) allows a fast development phase and rapid delivery of first results, consisting of dashboards for the monthly financial closing process.\n  Inovyn now has a more efficient and faster closing process, freeing up time for real analysis. Time savings are equivalent to 3.5 full-time staff each year, while the data refresh cycle has also been drastically cut from two hours to around every 15 minutes. Manual work for controllers and local CFOs has been reduced, and they can now focus on more valuable tasks. Importantly, the business now has a platform that meets its current and future reporting needs in terms of fixed costs, capex, inventory, customer tracking and sales analysis.\n The collaboration between Inovyn and Agilos shows how the implementation of Qlik Data Integration, Snowflake, Smartsheet and Qlik Sense can pave the way to create streamlined, automated and efficient reporting systems that deliver enhanced analytical capabilities and valuable time savings."

We had to find a less siloed approach to allow for a more collaborative and inclusive model,\u201d explains Fabien Pr\u00e9hel, Director of CRM, Marketing Solutions & Data Analytics for the Antalis group. Qlik Cloud\u00ae Analytics was the chosen solution thanks to its powerful associative engine, processing speed and self-service BI capacities. \u201cWith our new hybrid SaaS and on-premises Qlik Sense infrastructure, we retain the flexibility of regional development while also allowing all users access to a single hub where all applications are available.\u201d explains Fabien Pr\u00e9hel.\n The group has also strengthened the analysis of its e-commerce business, supported by 30 websites worldwide. Several dedicated applications enable precise analysis of the KPIs, from ERP transactional data to web data which can be used to optimize traffic generation and the conversion of visitors to new customers.\n More than 200 Qlik applications have been migrated to the cloud for 1,250 users (soon to be 2,500 users).\n Qlik Cloud Analytics enhances user autonomy and collaboration, offers a consolidated view across countries, and enables sophisticated analysis of ecommerce activities. \n The power and simplicity of the cloud are what appeal from a technical perspective: \u201cWe no longer need to worry about adjusting the performance of our servers,\u201d says Fabien Pr\u00e9hel.\n With the simplicity of Qlik Cloud, you can deploy self-service BI and empower your business users.

Behind Reworld\u2019s commitment to sustainability is an efficient and well-managed business. To meet growing stakeholder expectations, it needs the best possible understanding of its operations and how to optimize them. \r To achieve this, Reworld saw that it needed to rethink its data strategy. However, having achieved significant growth through acquisitions over its 40-year history, it struggled with multiple different reports and spreadsheets, and a miscellany of data sources from over 90 facilities. Achieving confidence in decisions was a struggle.\r Reworld needed a data integration solution that wasn\u2019t dependent on specific systems but would enable it to create mappings between multiple systems and sources. Talend Data Fabric became the \u201cconnective tissue\u201d that built the Reworld Data Hub, a centralized source that brought together data from hundreds of scattered SQL Server and Oracle databases.\r Reworld quickly saw how Talend gave the business credible data to allow quicker, more confident decisions. Importantly, it also provided a foundation for the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) across the organization.\r  The transformation enabled by Talend and the Reworld Data Hub goes beyond accurate and timely reporting: it\u2019s allowing Reworld to proactively identify, manage and mitigate critical threats. The Data Hub is also helping Reworld to optimize costs, redirect investments, and grow customer acquisitions, as well as providing an important foundation for the rising use of artificial intelligence. The company can explore new markets more quickly and respond to customers faster and with better solutions that better meet their sustainability objectives. Reworld is an excellent example of a business that overcame what it describes as a \u201chodgepodge\u201d of data systems and sources and developed a new Data Hub on which to build a comprehensive strategy based on data and, increasingly, AI.\r It\u2019s a move that\u2019s paying off financially, and also helping Reworld and other organizations to hit key sustainability targets that will benefit generations to come.\r With data available in the right place at the right time, profitability and sustainability don\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive. The solution is ready and waiting."

German supermarket chain EDEKA does its utmost to ensure that its products are as fresh as possible when they reach the shelves of its 3,200 supermarkets. Key to achieving this are three regional distribution companies, which use different IT systems to control the supply chain.\n To create more transparency throughout the process, EDEKA needed to pool data from various systems into one central point, where it could be integrated and analyzed at different levels of detail. The solution also needed to be easy to use as part of a self-service process.\n Qlik impressed with its high-performance in-memory technology, graphical visualization functions and high level of user friendliness. The right implementation partner for the project was also found in Bison Deutschland.\n After an initial three-day proof of concept, the trade and logistics specialists at Bison presented the first key figures and reports in tabular and graphical form. The decision to engage in a joint project was a done deal.\n Qlik Sense was installed and the first reports were migrated, with only occasional support required from Bison. Whether for goods receipt, stock put-away, picking, goods issues or transportation, Qlik now provides hundreds of users at EDEKA with fully transparent insight into the entire supply chain based on the latest data. Qlik also provides product turnover rates, transportation times within warehouses and the number of completed inbound deliveries.\n The customer service team can also give customers accurate information about routes and whether items are available for delivery \u2013 information that is particularly important during promotional campaigns.\n For any supermarket, examining data quickly and easily from different perspectives \u2013 such as individual warehouse locations, customers or orders \u2013 allows detailed analysis and quick, targeted responses.\n Evaluating ERP data also provides easy answers to complex questions, such sales volumes for a particular customer over a specific period, broken down by product group and warehouse location.\n With Qlik, the ability to use key insights to improve day-to-day operations can often be a critical differentiator in a competitive, high-volume retail environment."

BNL BNP Paribas deployed streaming solutions to ensure that digital data was always available to customers but needed a stable and reliable way to manage those high volumes quickly without consuming valuable mainframe resources. The bank approached Italian technology consultancy Quantyca. At the heart of its proposed solution was Qlik Data Integration, specifically Qlik Replicate. Working with Apache Kafka, it would sit between the bank\u2019s mainframe and data warehouse to enable the high-throughput, low-latency streaming of data in near-real time.\n The new environment was running in just a few months, with change data capture (CDC) functionality delivering data consistency and integrity, while continuous monitoring and management ensure smooth, rapid flows. With Qlik Data Integration in place, BNL BNP Paribas has transformed its data environment and its approach to data management and consumption.\n The data streaming service now powers 15 separate data domains connecting the mainframe to the open system. The data hub caches around 80 million digital records each day and around 40 million records are transferred to the open system daily.\n For BNL BNP Paribas\u2019 customers, the new data transfer speeds mean account information accessed through digital platforms is up to date and refreshed in near-real time.\n The BNL BNP Paribas case shows how even organizations with legacy operational and data environments can overcome their limitations and take full advantage of their data.\n The new architecture enabled by Qlik Replicate at BNP Paribas significantly eases pressure on the bank\u2019s mainframe, delivering a significant cost benefit on top of the speed and freshness of data.\n More importantly, it also enables BNL BNP Paribas to compete effectively with the industry\u2019s growing number of digital challengers thanks to a new range of digitally enabled apps and functionalities."

With the click of a button, LOWA now has access to the latest data, while automated updates allow analysis and reports to be provided daily. Qlik acts as a central database, which also ensures that all staff work with the same data and that there is a common understanding and transparency.\n Qlik is also set to be rolled out to the service department. A dashboard will make information available about the number and type of repairs required per shoe model, while a multi-year sales overview is also being planned.\n LOWA Switzerland is a great example of a business that wanted to keep a close eye on its data and the critical information contained within, focusing on outcomes rather than getting stuck in the weeds of acquisition and analysis.\n Combining Qlik\u2019s ease of use with expert advice and implementation support from a local partner was key to delivering a positive outcome.

Consolidated and visually appealing management reports are now available weekly, delivering insights across the organization.\n Qlik\u2019s adoption has changed attitudes at ARMSCOR, promoting data literacy across the organization and generating interest from other functions. With Qlik, data has gone from being a source of mistrust to an enabler of real and positive change \u2013 and without requiring a full system overhaul.\n Qlik solutions can also act as a roadmap for other parts of an organization. They can highlight how improved processes can be relatively simple to implement access but also enable an extensive range of benefits and exciting use cases."

Nortera produces and markets over 450,000 tons of ready-to-cook vegetables a year; buyers include retailers, food service operators and producers of prepared products.\n Whether it\u2019s optimizing factory operations and agriculture or handling HR tasks, data drives Nortera\u2019s approach to critical processes. Nortera\u2019s aim is to be a business intelligence (BI) leader in its industry; however, when it came to stepping up its data and analytics processes, Nortera needed a strong partner to support the implementation of its vision. Nortera turned to GINQO, a Canadian Qlik Elite Partner. The two businesses share a passion for maximizing value from data; the result was Nortera not simply adopting Qlik Sense but embracing it.\n Qlik Sense became the company\u2019s official reporting tool in every department. While the main source is Nortera\u2019s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, the company harvests data from 30 different software platforms.\n Nortera\u2019s ERP software now feeds data relating to supply, sales, inventory movements, shipments, purchasing, production and consumption. Tracking allergens in warehouses. Optimizing waste management. Verifying that weights of packaged goods are within set parameters. Nortera\u2019s use cases for Qlik are both broad and deep. Having over 550 Qlik users across the business means Nortera can significantly reduce licensing costs for other reporting software.\n Switching to Qlik Cloud also gives Nortera new capabilities. The new Authoring Mode means Nortera staff can achieve \u2018super user\u2019 results without hours of training, while agricultural workers can access Qlik directly from the field.\n Turning a dream into reality can be the tricky part of a data-led strategy, and this is where Qlik Partners come into play. They can align with your vision and work with you to bring the power of data to your fingertips.\n It\u2019s a path that Nortera took and it\u2019s delivered amazing results for the food producer. Qlik Sense is now present across its business, bringing new levels of efficiency and insight \u2013 and providing a solid foundation for yet more growth. It\u2019s the kind of success that could be achieved across any company of any shape or size."

The business has set itself the objective of achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2040.\n As part of achieving this objective, DPD wanted to identify the potential for improving efficiency and optimizing processes. It decided to implement a business intelligence solution capable of processing data from a range of source systems and mapping a wide spectrum of applications in one central BI system.\n\n Following a market analysis, Qlik Sense\u00ae stood out due to its analysis features and high flexibility for connecting to source systems. Other decisive criteria were its intuitive user interface and the various visualization options on offer.\n To implement the software, establish the data model and set up initial applications, DPD enlisted the experienced support of Informatec, a Swiss provider of IT services and Qlik Elite Solution Provider. Informatec scored highly for its technological know-how and technical expertise in transport and logistics.\n\n  The solution now comprises 20 streams. The \u2018Green Stream\u2019 applications perform detailed analysis of the ecological balance, evaluating how much CO2 is generated by transportation, the number of electric vans in use and the percentage of vehicles that are already green. Additional metrics include the number of parcels delivered on a climate-neutral basis and CO2 generated per package.\n Qlik also analyzes the amount and type of energy used at depots, with a focus on building data, green vans and first- and last-mile efficiency.\n Qlik is being used by around 120 employees in finance, HR, marketing and sales, as well as by senior management. The effectiveness of Qlik as a central analytics solution is also demonstrated by the development of new internal BI competencies at DPD Switzerland.\n \u201cFigures are only effective if you actually understand them,\u201d notes Rhianne Copson, BI Controller at DPD. \u201cIt\u2019s important to display data as simply and clearly as possible.

Carrefour operates around 14,000 stores worldwide and is enjoying particularly strong growth in Romania with more than 400 stores of various sizes and formats.  When Carrefour Romania embarked on its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, it envisaged multiple benefits from using a public cloud service, including faster delivery of new customer offerings. However, most of its data storage facilities were on-premises, either in stores or local data centers. While this gave the business stability, capacities were limited and structures excessively complex. Carrefour Romania saw that Talend Cloud Data Fabric was the tool it needed to turn multiple, disparate sources of data into a high-speed, high-value resource. Critical to the choice was the extensive range of prebuilt connectors available within Talend and the decentralized architecture it offered, as was Carrefour Romania\u2019s collaboration with local consultancy btProvider.  Carrefour Romania now has around 50 separate flows operated either by btProvider or other partners. Sources include BigQuery, PostgreSQL and Carrefour Romania\u2019s ERP solution. The new data environment has enabled Carrefour Romania to develop and enhance processes across the business. Successful projects this environment enables cover key areas such as metal and plastic recycling, e-transport and digital transfers of accounting data to auditors. Carrefour Romania\u2019s marketing operation can now build out the Act for Good customer loyalty program, using high-speed data access to develop personalized customer promotions and incentives. Near-real-time synchronization of prices and stock availability are also improving the customer experience. The broad range of integrations and use cases that Carrefour Romania has been able to build with Talend and btProvider illustrates the speeds of development that are available to any business. Siloed and disparate data sources don\u2019t have to be insurmountable obstacles. With Talend, businesses of all sizes and sectors can turn them into powerful assets that deliver tangible value and impressive results. As with Carrefour Romania, it can also act as a springboard for a host of other exciting digital initiatives and accelerated processes."

As Carvajal searched for a more powerful solution, it turned to a local Qlik Partner, Manar Technologies, which introduced the business to Qlik. QlikView\u00ae was the perfect springboard for Carvajal\u2019s analytics operation, and when it was time to move to the next level, Manar proposed Qlik Cloud\u00ae Analytics, and, in particular, Qlik Sense\u00ae.\n With updated graphics, a more responsive design and self-service capabilities, Qlik Sense appealed immediately to Carvajal. It allowed Carvajal to substantially overhaul its client-facing offering, giving end users the opportunity to shape solutions to match specific requirements. And with AI on board, Carvajal could take advantage of Insight Advisor to complement the analysis with strategic insights driven by natural language. The sales, logistics and marketing teams of over 300 companies are now regular Qlik users \u2013 a figure that is rising steadily as Carvajal implements an exciting international growth strategy. The switch to Qlik Sense has already led to a 10% rise in user numbers and associated sales.\n Automated reporting now breaks down silos between functions and enhances seller and supplier-specific data with wider market and financial information. Insight Advisor then drives further value by allowing users to optimize strategies and sales through accessible, powerful, AI-driven user experiences.\n For many, working with a Qlik Partner isn\u2019t just a simple transactional relationship: it\u2019s an important strategic alliance that can deliver high-value results both for businesses and their clients.\n Manar worked with Carvajal to build a powerful client-facing solution, and the roadmap now includes building on the capabilities of Insight Advisor and deploying Qlik AutoML to strengthen the tool\u2019s predictive capabilities.\n The future for Carvajal is packed with exciting new possibilities \u2013 and of course, it includes continued collaboration with Manar."

Qlik uses change data capture calls to SAP and replicates data into the data lake. Databricks Delta Live Tables then performs the data transformation and applies best practices to deploy reliable pipelines at scale. The process makes silver-level tables accessible to the data lake, with Qlik helping to normalize the SAP data table names.\n\n TSV\u2019s goal is to make data available to business users in near-real time. With Databricks and Qlik, the company now streams data throughout the day, connecting Qlik Replicate to new data every few minutes.\n Previously, TSV\u2019s business data was only available to users in batches on request. The new process involving Databricks and Qlik is helping the company save man-hours and lower compute costs. TSV hopes to reduce the amount of time its team spends running and maintaining the data replication process from 80% to less than 10%.\n\n Having vast quantities of data in multiple locations, formats and structures doesn\u2019t have to stop it delivering for your business quickly and effectively. \n With the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform and Qlik Cloud\u00ae Data Integration, TSV is now set to continue its journey to maximize operational efficiency and deliver more of the revolutionary technology its customers want.\n By establishing a single source of truth for SAP data, manufacturers like TSV can also spend much more time on productive activities that serve their business and generate revenue."

In a business the size of IndianOil, even small changes can make big differences to efficiency and performance. Managing opportunities is a substantial task in itself. IndianOil\u2019s flagship i-DRIVE project identified digital gaps in IndianOil. It saw the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) at an early stage but highlighted how data produced by digitization initiatives was siloed, hard to manage and underused. IndianOil needed a platform to acquire all this data, process it and present results in an engaging format.  IndianOil migrated to Qlik Sense to act as its user-facing visualization window for many of the initiatives introduced through i-DRIVE. Qlik offers a simple architecture capable of handling highly complex tasks, and key stakeholders at IndianOil appreciate its effectiveness as a solution. Ease of use and adoption was another critical factor. IndianOil\u2019s Information Systems (IS) department facilitated training for adoption across the organization. IndianOil now has around 150+ \u2018power users\u2019 and 10,000 regular users in a broad range of roles. The use cases are multiple and diverse. Tasks handled by IndianOil\u2019s growing suite of applications, which leverage AI/ML capabilities and demand dashboards, range from catering to board-level strategic decisions. Qlik delivers insights into customer behavior, IndianOil\u2019s critical supply chain, inventory management and the performance of equipment and machinery. Adding to the efficiencies are Qlik\u2019s self-service capabilities, which allow users to define their own parameters, build their own dashboards and access custom analytics and insights. Qlik dashboards allow users to visualize how markets and strategies are changing and develop innovative responses there and then. Analytics processes at IndianOil that previously took hours can now be completed in minutes, while energy-saving initiatives enabled by Qlik are also delivering impressive financial results. From the Chair and the board to production staff, Qlik is delivering high-value insights quickly and effectively. IndianOil can now invest more time in predictive analysis and discovering new technologies, inventions and ideas."

Climate change and sustainability are challenges that ANU is determined to engage with proactively, starting with its own operation. It is the second-largest electricity user in the Australian Capital Territory, and its large buildings account for around half of its carbon footprint. A team was set up to understand data related to energy consumption. Having replaced hundreds of old and inaccurate dial-based electricity meters, ANU needed a new set of dashboards with the levels of visual appeal and engagement to harness the newly available data. ANU worked with authorised Qlik Partner Cast Solutions to build its Energy Dashboard. The Qlik-based platform combines a variety of data sets sourced from over 200 buildings and 1,000 electricity meters to understand where and how energy is used. The Energy Dashboard combines real-time local weather data to enhance building energy efficiency. Qlik Sense handles data modelling and visualizations to provide near-real-time insights to users across ANU, and a range of dashboards to manage day-to-day operations, maintenance and capital works. The Energy Dashboard provides critical insights into energy usage and heat transfer, building and structural characteristics, and operational factors and occupant behaviours that influence energy consumption. It highlights energy hotspots and opportunities for improvement, enabling management staff to see where and how energy is being used and how and where resources could be invested to reduce carbon output and costs. It also provides enables a deeper understanding of consumption in specific buildings, and consumption outliers and hotspots. Prior to implementing the Energy Dashboard, lack of transparency on carbon emissions and energy costs was holding ANU back. That has all changed. Decisions on how and where ANU should invest to reduce its energy consumption and carbon footprint are now based on data-led evidence. ANU is now extending the tool to other sustainability-based use cases such as water usage and waste management, with the aim of reducing waste to landfill and increasing recycling, repurposing and reuse. It\u2019s a small win for ANU, but a larger win for the environment."

One of NECPC\u2019s key strengths is its ability to adapt.It had implemented SAP ECC as its core system, using SAP connectors to bring data into QlikView. However, users began to see issues.  Batch-processed SAP data was reloaded into QlikView daily, but the delay meant data wasn\u2019t useable for finance and material requirements planning. NECPC saw that providing data in real time would enable better decisions, but with some people using QlikView for analysis and others relying on spreadsheets, it was not easy to create a unified environment. Staff had used Qlik since the company\u2019s inception and understood its benefits, but when the time came to rebuild its data analytics platform, NECPC looked at a wide range of products. Qlik Replicate caught its eye. The business quickly developed a proof of concept for a key function using Qlik Replicate and Qlik Compose.The real-time reloading of SAP data using Qlik Compose and the ease of use of Qlik Sense were highly rated both by the ICT department and each business unit. NECPC could then start building out the system with confidence. Restructuring the data analytics platform using Qlik products went smoothly, with deployment completed significantly ahead of schedule. With no need for each department to create its own reports, the entire company could effectively converse in a common language. Users can now obtain SAP data in real time and plan supply and demand almost automatically. As a result, NECPC has reduced the risk of excess inventory by 30%. In addition, by automating previously manual data-creation processes, each business unit has saved nearly 160 man-hours a year. Since launching the new platform, cooperation between NECPC\u2019s ICT department and various other business units has become even closer. Checks on system use have received good responses, with more specific requests about things like adding new data and fewer inquiries about how the platform works. In response to requests for improvements, NECPC has further polished the system and improved its ease of use. Plans are also underway for new opportunities and data integrations, including using machine learning to help NECPC staff develop new ideas."

The unified and elevated data landscape created a clear uplift in data literacy.\n This has led to the creation of the Openreach Data and Insight (ODI) team, which allows the business to streamline the reporting process further and switch from simply delivering insight to actively informing decisions and actions. It was a step change in Openreach\u2019s Qlik deployment.\n  Actionable insights have allowed Openreach to cut delivery times for its high-speed Ethernet service by half, successfully meet regulatory obligations and significantly improve both costs and service targets for the FTTP project. Openreach now uses Qlik extensively in its field engineering operations, ensuring that managers can track team performance effectively. The business is also using Qlik to present predictive analytics to senior leaders, providing year-end forecasts and the opportunity to carry out \u2018what if\u2019 analysis.\n Reimagining a business\u2019s approach to data doesn\u2019t just have the potential to improve specific processes or save analysts\u2019 time. Modernizing its reporting environment certainly gave Openreach a great opportunity to rebuild the data it needed to achieve specific business aims, but it also provided critical support for wider organizational change.\n When used most effectively, businesses can evolve from having compelling data, reports and dashboards available in a single place to becoming increasingly directive \u2013 and effective \u2013 with the insights they deliver."

That meant 60 to 70 different media partners all speaking a slightly different data language. That cost the company millions of dollars and thousands of hours. Plus the cost of missed or unseen opportunities.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we become a data-driven organization,\u201d says Brian Sullivano, Senior Director, Marketing Technology at Georgia-Pacific. \u201cWe need our teams to ensure that we\u2019re creating value, increasing the speed at which we react to the marketplace and most importantly, delivering against the daily needs of our consumers.\u201d  Data is now accessible from a host of previously siloed sources and consolidated into a common language and format.\u00a0 With Qlik Sense, Georgia-Pacific was quickly able to develop a range of dashboards and report-building applications. These now allow individual teams to dive into the data that matters to them, as well as make it available to cross-functional teams.  The deployment of Qlik Sense means data is now accessible from a host of previously siloed sources and consolidated into a common language and format.\u00a0 \u201cBy in-sourcing marketing mix modeling, we\u2019ve been able to understand the effectiveness of those investments more frequently and make better-informed decisions about our media choices,\u201d says Laura Knebusch, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Consumer Experience. \u201cAnd that goes beyond choosing between TV or digital \u2013 it extends to tactics, TV dayparts and partners. It\u2019s had an immediate impact.\u201d  With critical business data available centrally, quickly, and easily, your teams can elevate problem solving, find unexpected business and marketing opportunity, and maximize previously unseen advantage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTeams or individual cross-functional team members can go in and see every single dimension and measure what we have in the business today,\u201d Sullivano explains. \u201cThrough simple click-and-select-type capabilities, they\u2019re able to create their own reports, save those reports, publish them, share them with other people and collaborate on the details and information gained.\u201d "

        "content": " The technology leader now provides access to real-time data across multiple applications through a modern web experience. The complexity of their data setup put a high cognitive load on employees. And because analytics were not automatically updated across various platforms, leaders got reports and gave presentations using information that wasn\u2019t always up to date.\u00a0 \u201cDuring certain performance reviews or operating meetings, PowerPoint serves its purpose, but when it came to the idea of uniting Intuit as a data-driven culture, the PowerPoint deck really couldn\u2019t facilitate that,\u201d says Aaron Growitz, Intuit Group Manager of Business Intelligence and Data Visualization.  Data from both Qlik Sense\u00ae and other third-party sources like AWS flow into the One Intuit Portal through Qlik Sense\u2019s API integrations. The APIs also create reusable components that can serve as embedded analytics. Intuit\u2019s end users then consume the data via a single page application on the React framework. The embedded analytics enabled by Qlik Sense\u2019s APIs\u00a0 are a game changer. Embedded analytics seamlessly integrate analytic content into other business products, websites and applications.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s all about enabling simpler experiences through some of our extensions or navigation mashups,\u201d Growitz says. \u201cThe idea of just using that left-hand navigation and pulling in a bunch of information outside of BI tools into a web framework took off really well.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt makes a massive difference for those that live in this dashboard.\u201d  Putting the time into making complex data analytics easy to consume pays dividends. Growitz notes that Intuit didn\u2019t have to provide user training for the portal. \u201cOnce people saw the ease and consistency of the UI and UX, it took off,\u201d he says. Intuit always valued data, but now it is a more data-driven company with a modern, accessible approach. Over the past two years, usage has grown 10x for the embedded analytics the team supports."

There are more than 15,000 stores in 85-plus markets, with customer data pouring in from every conceivable platform. The company wanted to integrate all that data \u2014 85,000 structured and unstructured data sources \u2014 to get a single view of its customers and global operations. Unfortunately, their IT architecture prevented it.\u00a0  \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a standard way to ingest data,\u201d says Dan Djuric, Vice President, Global Infrastructure and Enterprise Information Management.\u201cWe also had more than 11,000 business users, 35 data scientists, and multiple marketing agencies \u2014 and all of them wanted to build their own database.\u201d  Domino\u2019s selected Talend\u00ae Data Fabric. They also built a comprehensive data tracker which feeds Domino\u2019s Enterprise Management Framework and real-time data streaming. It\u2019s combined with third party visualization and analytics solutions.  With a modern data platform in place, Domino\u2019s now has a trusted, single source of truth that helps improve business performance \u2014 from logistics to financial forecasting \u2014 while enabling one-to-one buying experiences across multiple touchpoints. \u201cWe think of it as giving store managers a smart watch for their in-store operations,\u201d said Kripakar Krishnamurthy, Director, Enterprise Data Engineering, Platforms and Architecture at Domino\u2019s. \u201cWe want them to have reliable information about what\u2019s happening right now so they can maximize efficiency, deliver a superior customer experience, and boost their sales.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve become an e-commerce company that sells pizza. Talend has helped us make that digital transformation,\u201d exclaimed Djuric.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0With real-time data and analytics, store managers can quickly see daily orders, prep time, delivery vs. pick-up, and more. They can project demand and forecast staffing requirements. \u201cWe were already producing a lot of real-time information, and now put it to better use,\u201d Krishnamurthy noted. \u201cWe wanted our store managers to see what\u2019s ahead and make the right moves.\u201d  Vast data and multiple sources can be an untapped resource. But it can also tap other resources as you attempt to analyze or contextualize it. But a unified, agile, scalable data platform can capture, cleanse, standardize, enrich, store, and distribute data. It becomes an asset.\u00a0 Djuric observes, \u201cWe\u2019re an aggressively aspirational company, and store growth is very important. We needed to make sure we were on a platform that could scale, and Talend fulfills that requirement.\u201d"

        "content": " They\u2019ve generated remarkable improvements in the efficiency of acquiring and qualifying leads. By using the API and altering their qualification and acquisition process with just one of the four lead suppliers. By being more selective on which leads they buy, they are not only saving money by buying fewer leads, but they are also saving money by not paying a third party to vet low-quality leads. Just based on the costs of one supplier. From here, they will begin to change the process with their other three lead suppliers for additional savings. The small personal loan space is fast moving, fraught with risk, and extremely competitive. Leads are often acquired en masse. So an organization often has as little as 30 seconds to vet viable leads and decide whether or not to purchase that lead.\u00a0\u00a0 Conventional process makes it nearly impossible to input all the necessary information quickly enough time to make an informed decision on which leads to actually purchase. Qlik AutoML\u00ae is informed by records of which loans were funded. Automated machine learning recognizes patterns that lead to successful loan fundings. The resulting model helps qualify leads. Working together with the data science and customer service teams at Qlik\u00ae, Integra exposed this lead scoring model to an API and connected it to their Loan Management System (LMS). With this new connection, each time a lead now submits a form to the LMS, the API automatically queries the model in Qlik AutoML and returns the probability a given loan will convert. By being more selective on which leads they buy, they are not only saving money by buying fewer leads, but they are also saving money by not paying a third party to vet low-quality leads.\u00a0 Integra is also using data to predict which customers are likely to default on their first payment. This information gives them the ability to be proactive with customers, implement preventative measures before a customer defaults, and create a more positive lending experience overall. Integra took data that was already accessible, but hard to extract value. They unleashed Qlik AutoML and Qlik Cloud\u00ae to turn that vast amount of data into meaningful market and customer insight. Better still, it happens blazingly fast. Every enterprise has the data. Yours does. But making it meaningful takes tools and action. And the sooner you get started on it, the sooner that value will become realized."

        "content": " Retail leader uses real-time data to support in-the-moment decisions. Rapid real-time data access boosts store performance by giving staff the information they need when they need it. Store staff can make quick decisions, see current challenges, plan for the future, and appreciate the impact their work has on the wider picture. Access to an array of dashboards and reports updated with fresh data every two minutes enables quick, in-store decision-making. Gathering actionable data from more than 650 stores spread throughout the USA, Europe, and UK was a huge problem. Time zones, operating styles of three business brands, and different information systems created remarkable challenges. Covid-19\u00a0made it even worse, because of store closures and inconsistent pandemic strategies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe were dealing with many different systems and technologies, so we could not easily gather, explore, or learn from information,\u201d said Director of Workforce Management, Joanna Matthy. \u201cIt meant that reports had to be cobbled together which took a lot of administrative time.\u201d Urban Outfitters migrated to a Snowflake cloud fed by Qlik Data Integration. They could stream 50 GB of data per day from all those on-premises data sources.\u00a0 Qlik Data Analytics became the company standard for in-store reporting and data analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Working together, the two Qlik solutions created unprecedented access to critical data and enabled more informed action. Reports that took hours, now take minutes. Qlik Data Integration enables small packets of data to be constantly streamed to the cloud rather than a big-bang approach that takes hours. Previously, data could only be manipulated once the ETL (extract, transform, load) process had started, which meant hours of delay. Now, it takes fewer than five minutes for distribution centers, and at most 15 minutes for the order management system (OMS). The takeaway here is that you can get the most from your data, even if you\u2019re dealing with archaic systems, incompatible platforms, decentralized data stores, or any of the other countless hurdles to business insights and planning.\u00a0 Urban Outfitters said: \u201cQlik has provided a longer runway and a more sustainable way to operate with fewer inhibitors than we had before. Using it to obtain a holistic snapshot of a store\u2019s performance throughout the day is our ultimate aim.\u201d"
