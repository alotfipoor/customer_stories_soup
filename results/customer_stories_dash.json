        "content": "AI in Dash Enterprise — save your spot for tomorrow's  launch event session ! Industries Software Development Summary DOWNLOAD PDF PriceLabs creates analytics and AI tools for small businesses that manage short-term rental properties. Their clients range from individuals with a few investment properties that they have converted into vacation getaways to enterprises that manage hundreds or thousands of properties. Through the power of Python and Dash, the PriceLabs platform gives these property managers custom views of detailed, real-time analytics that aid in maximizing revenue, prospecting future markets, and monitoring their properties’ performance. \"We do a lot of processing and calculations before we display our results to customers; we chose Python and Dash so we could do a lot of that online and quickly show data based on parameters that each customer specifies without having to create tons of infrastructure around it first.\" David Witalka, Data Scientist, PriceLabs To maximize revenue, property managers aim to find the right balance  between prices and occupancy: increase the prices too much, and you might not  get too many bookings; lower them significantly, and you might get fully booked but at super cheap rates. Fluctuations in demand based on seasons, day of the week,  holidays and events, and many other factors make this a constantly evolving problem. Setting the right price requires access to a large amount of data and a large time investment to monitor and react every day. Small businesses and individual managers find it hard to keep up and remain competitive on platforms  like Airbnb and Vrbo, especially as they scale up the number of properties  under their management. An ongoing pandemic adds complexity to these tasks. While COVID-19 has dealt an unprecedented blow to the travel and accommodation industries, it has also been an unexpected boon for the  vacation rental sector. “Because of COVID-19, people are hesitant to stay in hotels, and more people are working remotely. People are booking more extended  stays,” explains Pedro Borges, a senior data scientist at PriceLabs. “But we’re also seeing changes in booking lead time and fluctuations when the worst  parts of the pandemic hit. That’s why being able to stay on top of current market  trends is important to our clients.” At the beginning of the pandemic, the PriceLabs platform was built  around their Dynamic Pricing tool, which helps in competitively pricing one’s  properties. But PriceLabs’ team found that clients were demanding more tailored views of  what was going on in their markets and in their portfolio. How were current  properties performing at any given time? Which prospective geographical markets would be good to invest in? PriceLabs’ team of data scientists wanted to grow the platform to meet their clients’ demands. With over 50 billion market data points to analyze each night, they knew these answers were out there if they could only process and  present them in a consumable way. The team evaluated well-known BI software but encountered bottlenecks  when they had to translate their data into a row-column format that the BI  tools could ingest. The analytics that PriceLabs displays to clients require a lot  of preprocessing and data science to produce, compounded by the fact  that each client can specify custom parameters about a specific property type or  geographic area. Off-the-shelf tools could allow for the creation of new reports,  but not without a lot of work on the part of the data science team to reformat their data, add new columns, and specify requirements for the full-stack team.  Developing and shipping even one new visualization type to clients would have  required many weeks of iteration, in which the data science team would add new data and the full-stack team would figure out how to visualize it. PriceLabs’ Dynamic Pricing tool uses Dash to visualize pricing and occupancy projections calculated in Python and customized per client parameters. Dash enabled PriceLabs to quickly develop new tools for clients, like the Portfolio Analytics view, which makes it easy to identify how properties are performing against each other and the market.  Since Dash is the fastest way to develop rich, interactive data applications in Python, it became a natural extension of PriceLabs’ data science workflow. Reducing full-stack iterations puts more control in the hands of the data science team to innovate responsively to their clients’ needs. And the developments pay off, with property managers reporting anywhere from 10% to 40% increases in revenue after adding PriceLabs to their tech stacks. With thousands of customers spanning more than 100 countries, PriceLabs continues to grow globally. New challenges and client needs will accompany this growth, and Dash is an important asset to ensure that PriceLabs’ platform remains flexible and future-facing. Founded in 2014, PriceLabs is a powerful revenue management and dynamic pricing software for vacation and short-term rentals. Data-driven predictive analytics, a powerful rules engine, and industry-leading data tools help their 10,000+ customers in 95+ countries increase revenues and save them hours in the process.

Industries Sports Summary DOWNLOAD PDF Kansas City Chiefs Webinar Highlight Reel The Kansas City Chiefs have demonstrated success on the field and in the fan base they have cultivated. As 2020, 2023, and 2024 Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs have been the highest-performing team in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division for several years and boast one of the highest home attendance rates in the NFL. Behind the scenes of this success, their Finance, Strategy, and Analytics Team works hard to capitalize on a robust fan base and optimize the game-day experience at one of the NFL’s largest stadiums. \"Deploying an application is a whole different ballgame from building one. Deploying and building from your workspace in Dash Enterprise is very easy because the platform handles a lot of the work. We can make a quick change and deploy within five minutes without disrupting the service.\" Andrew Schutte, Senior Data Scientist, Kansas City Chiefs Digital transformation across any organization is no easy feat. Needs can vary by department and require different specialized platforms to address. The Kansas City Chiefs front office had identified several use cases requiring access to real-time analytics on live data streams:  Dash Enterprise enabled the analytics team to quickly build, style, deploy, and manage multiple Dash apps tailored to their distinct use cases. The platform’s  Workspaces  code editor allowed the team’s data scientists to write Dash apps in Python in a familiar Jupyter Notebook environment and preview them live, all in the browser.  With this workflow, the team built a working prototype app in two days to display key social media metrics. One Dash app quickly turned into three, where stakeholders can not only view marketing KPIs, but also filter historical impressions data, track marketing campaigns across platforms, and view top social content. The Dash apps call a streaming service API every four hours and store the data in the app’s Redis database, ready for whatever custom analytics the team’s data scientists develop. Dash’s modular, component-based framework gives teams the flexibility to choose how their Python analytics are presented — from interactive data tables to histograms to embedded video. The team went on to develop similar Dash apps for ticket scanning and dynamic pricing. Visualizing live ticket scans on game day gives the stadium operations team important information for crowd flow and entry logistics and provides a baseline for parking logistics and preventing traffic backups. Similarly, the Dash app for ticket pricing presents up-to-date data to help the sales team quickly evaluate inventory and demand in order to make appropriate price changes. A Dash app to visualize live ticket scan data opened the conversation around what data and visualizations would make the Kansas City Chiefs operations more proactive for game entry. \"The analytics team’s work has a broad reach in the organization. Dash Enterprise enables us to deploy at scale, and its security and authentication allow us to deliver quickly without requiring IT support.\" Michael Ragsdale, VP of Finance, Strategy and Analytics, Kansas City Chiefs By investing in Dash Enterprise, the front office gained a unified platform that put analytics at the center of business and game-day stadium operations.  Time-consuming, manual workflows in the marketing team were replaced by connecting to live data streams, saving 32 person-hours each week. For the sales team, dynamic pricing with Dash reduced the amount of time required to collect and analyze sales data. And by using Dash to replicate the functions of other software platforms used in the past, the Finance, Strategy, and Analytics team saves on annual software licensing costs, avoiding expensive ticketing data solutions. Instead, they are equipped to deliver high-value, real-time analytics at scale across the organization.  As more needs arise, the analytics team continues to develop and deploy new Dash apps, with exciting new horizons set on player and game analytics. Plotly supports the Kansas City Chiefs as they champion the use of data for a better organization and a better team. Want to see more?

To succeed as one of the world’s largest offshore operators, Equinor is constantly evaluating and updating the data models behind its subsurface reservoir operations, offshore wind farms, and carbon capture and storage projects.   One of the tools behind these data operations is Equinor’s innovative platform, Webviz, which bypasses the knowledge barriers of specialty software and the technical limitations of traditional business analytics platforms to operationalize data science across the company’s business segments.  “Webviz couples with our modeling stack to perform work that would otherwise take 30,000 labor hours each year at a single NCS field. Thanks to Dash, this work is simpler, saves time, provides better-looking plots and enables a higher degree of customization compared to available tools on the market.” Equinor Geologist The custom subsurface Dash component displays a reservoir grid simulation and a depth map with seismic resolution. Accurate subsurface modeling can have a big impact on production, and can also play a significant role in preventing harm to people and the environment. With operations in over 30 countries worldwide, Equinor must ensure a smooth workflow for keeping these models as accurate as possible when new subsurface information has been acquired. Each execution of the update workflow creates an ensemble of 100 to 500 models (up to several terabytes of simulated data) to account for subsurface uncertainty. This output must then be analyzed and presented to management and relevant partners — a lengthy and error-prone process requiring engineers to collate screenshots from a variety of industry software platforms into a single, static presentation. The work was demotivating and formed a bottleneck for efficient business decisions. The Webviz platform gives  decision-makers access to the most current updates to Equinor’s  subsurface model ensembles and follow-on analytics.   Additionally, the platform provides a standardized way to present typical data sets, facilitating efficient quality control across different assets.  Finally, Dash enables Equinor’s  engineering and front-end development teams to work together more efficiently despite differing skill sets.  Additional Equinor groups working with wind farms and carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects are also developing their own Webviz plugins. Based on the success in subsurface applications, Equinor’s wind group piloted Webviz for offshore wind applications, demonstrating great potential for future fit-for-purpose developments. Similarly, the CCS group began scoping use cases for Webviz to support the analysis of CO2 storage simulation models. By capitalizing on the flexibility of Dash, Python users regardless of domain expertise are enabled to develop the tools they need, when they need them.

Industries Professional Sports Summary DOWNLOAD PDF Cory Jez, Head of the Utah Jazz’s basketball analytics group, is all about listening to the numbers that give the Jazz a winning edge. Utah’s analytics team is small, comprising a data scientist, analyst, and data engineer. But together, they publish Dash applications that serve over 40 managers, coaches, and other staff who all have unique information needs in order to make the team run — both on and off the court. \"Running a professional basketball team in many ways is like running any other business. It all comes down to information! With over 2 million data points generated for every NBA game, we needed a way to get the right information into the hands of coaches and executives quickly and securely.\" Cory Jez, Head of Basketball Analytics Group, Utah Jazz Cory’s analytics team must deliver robust analytics on a continual basis via multiple channels: TVs in the office, iPads used during games or on the road, and hard-copy PDF booklets are just a few outlets. These must be easy to understand, explorable, and responsive to constant change, but also secure for varying levels of end-user authorization — with printable capability, to boot. Different players and new opponents play every game, so the team’s Snowflake data warehouse is continuously updating with data from multiple sources. In short, Cory’s team has to run a living, breathing data operation for over 40 different end users. In Cory’s three years of coordinating analytics capabilities for the Utah Jazz, his team had inherited a legacy system, running data models with PHP scripting and Excel files. They used Tableau to visualize their data, but it became expensive at the level of end-users Cory’s analytics team was serving and couldn’t deliver the specific data views required by coaches and managers. For example, starting line-ups that identify a team’s starting players, typically the five strongest who drive the game, can be changed even up to 30 minutes before game time. Player shot charts illustrate the basketball court and the locations from which a player shoots the ball. Visualizations like these were impossible to pull off and update quickly using Tableau. The needs of Cory’s analytics team greatly exceeded the capabilities of their legacy system. To get an edge on the data science operations of their rivals, Cory’s team needed the advanced analytics and visualization capabilities of Python, and Dash Enterprise to deliver visual analytics to their end users. Recently, Cory’s analytics team took ownership over their own technology stack. With it came a window of opportunity to create a system that worked better for everyone — if they could pull it off in their three-month off-season. As a small team serving the diverse needs of over 40 stakeholders, without back-end DevOps or front-end web development teams to support them, they needed a nothing-but-net solution.  Building web applications with Flask could be a partial fix, but the team really needed a way to build interactive analytic applications tailored for data science, as well as a way to manage and deploy them securely. As a Python user, Cory knew about Plotly’s open-source Dash framework for building analytic applications. It suited the team’s needs because each application they built could be written in Python alone, from analytics to GUI. He also learned about Dash Enterprise, Plotly’s one-stop shop for data science operations. Horizontally scalable hosting, deployment, and authentication for analytic web apps, without any IT or DevOps requirement, were finally within reach with one shot.  Interactive player shot charts created by freelance Plotly content creator, JP Hwang. Dash Enterprise enabled Cory’s team to make over 20 dashboards securely available in the Dash Enterprise App Portal, where the Utah Jazz staff had easy, curated access to the latest information they needed to make operational and business decisions: Now, Cory won’t spend his off-seasons worrying about managing the tech stack and can focus on navigating NCAA modeling, college rankings, and upcoming draft pick strategy. He’s using Dash datatables to show the relevant information for the upcoming NBA draft or free agency.  \"Dash Enterprise has been a lifesaver. I’m able to quickly create, edit, and deploy customized Dash apps as soon as I need to.

As a key business unit of the bank, CIBC Capital Markets offers equity and debt capital market products, mergers and acquisitions, global markets (sales and trading), merchant banking, and other investment banking advisory services. Within Capital Markets’ sales and trading business, the Quantitative Solutions group develops the derivatives pricing library used by the bank to price and manage risk surrounding its derivatives portfolios. The group also supports trading and sales desks in market and position analysis with the development of machine learning models and other data science initiatives.  Dash Enterprise is used by the Quantitative Solutions group — spread across London, New York, and Toronto — for delivering quantitative analytics and data science. Additionally, the platform is utilized by the Technology group to build personalized, ad-hoc tools and is also accessed by sales and trading as part of a self-service analytics offering. “Dash has been a valuable outlet to make the best use of people’s skills and creativity. It allows people to very quickly turn an idea into a useful tool that can be used by the rest of the team.” Gareth Stoyle, CIBC The Quantitative Solutions group at CIBC Capital Markets needed a way to reduce friction and time-to-insight when communicating and actioning against insights in response to rapidly changing market conditions. The team aimed to enable ad-hoc departmental level client analytics for individual trading and sales desks, while simultaneously developing operationalized data applications for deeper actionable insights across broader groups.  These projects were traditionally handled in spreadsheets which, while highly effective for exploratory and small-to-mid sized projects, halted progress due to their static nature. The team experimented with BI solutions, but found these platforms too difficult to customize and develop to their specific requirements.  The Quantitative Solutions group was looking for a solution that would enable its quantitative analysts and data scientists to rapidly build ad-hoc custom visuals through to larger-scale analytics applications with production-grade user interfaces via a common platform. With Dash Enterprise, the Quantitative Solutions group is able to regularly develop and deploy custom client analytics applications with insights from machine learning models. These data applications largely utilize Databricks as their primary data platform, but the apps can also be powered by other internal data sources and APIs. They are then deployed as production-grade data applications through Dash Enterprise and accessed from within the CIBC intranet. CIBC's data application architecture The apps enforce strict security measures with custom internal security and authentication integration to protect access to data and channel information toward the appropriate audiences. This tightened security is achieved while preserving the self-service nature of client analytics apps for sales and trading desks.

Industries Utilities Summary DOWNLOAD PDF A major North American public utility was facing a problem that it  couldn’t quite quantify. The company had six thousand employees managing its power  network operations, but they couldn’t keep up with customer requests:  downed wires, power outages, low voltage, and blown transformers. Work orders to  fix these problems were piling up, while unresolved customer complaints  automatically escalated up the chain, leading to disruption at all levels. Among the six thousand employees was an electrical engineer and avid open-source user of Dash, Plotly’s framework for building interactive  analytic applications. He already used Python to work with departmental data, so  it was easy to create Dash applications on his local machine, using Dash’s  front end to look for patterns that might lead to a solution. By utilizing Dash to quickly and visually explore the data, it became apparent that 90% of the department’s work orders were consistently backlogged.  The engineer shared the Dash application with his managers, who determined that they needed more detail. Dash’s modular, component-based nature led to a quick build-out of the application, allowing managers to gain data views by technician, location, number of open orders, and job type. Dash was  becoming a reliable way to quickly generate and share data views within the  department. Fifty technicians, several managers, and 100 engineers regularly referenced the application in order to dispatch the right  technicians to the right jobs and ensure that no one was being overworked or underutilized.  The insights gained and the impact on work efficiency led to the creation of more Dash applications. Analytic applications of smart meter histories and transformer load data became regular go-to tools for the department’s top executives, who didn’t need to know Python or advanced analytics to gain detailed insight into their operations. They began to gain a real picture of customer demand, energy usage, and infrastructure health, contextualized by historical data and future risk indicators. Interactive maps and color grading let users see full, information-rich views at one glance. Managers could explore high-level views of an entire region or drill down to a specific transformer. Hover text and responsive tables displayed details on demand.   Dash Enterprise provides simplified layouts, sidebars, and headers. That means point-and-click theme editing for developers and easy visual scanning for users. Dash Enterprise comes with out-of-the-box connectors for the most popular big data backends, like Databricks, RAPIDS, Snowflake, and Salesforce. Using Dash had a clear payoff for the utility’s customers. Within one year, 97% of work orders were being completed on time, as compared with the year prior, when 90% were past due. Customers were making 10 times fewer complaints. And at least 500 of the 600 voltage regulators were fixed because Dash enabled the department to dispatch their technicians more efficiently.  Within the department, Dash’s return on investment led to the creation of two software developer roles to further what was once the passion project of one dedicated employee. They secured a Dash Enterprise team license, opening up enterprise  branding and styling  capabilities that accelerated the arrangement, styling, and customization of their applications. The team was able to build analytic apps even faster by abstracting away application design tasks. They quickly developed a prototype application to apply machine learning to forecast electrical loads and prevent faulty distribution during weather extremes. Meanwhile, colleagues in the R&D department took notice due to parallels with similar projects. Dash’s popularity across different departments continued to grow. Its Python interface and 40+ technical charting types meant that most engineers and data scientists were already equipped to produce working Dash applications. Plotly’s  Consulting and Training team  supported this growing user base with several customized workshops. Over the course of a year, more engineers and data scientists learned basic Dash application development and progressed to integrating  artificial intelligence  and deploying applications from Azure Databricks notebooks. As the number of people building and sharing Dash applications grows, deployment from local machines is not a scalable solution. Dash Enterprise features like  application management , user tracking, and  authentication  are necessities for business operations. Needs for a stable deployment solution that integrates with the organization’s existing systems have been identified so that the utility can continue building and deploying mission-critical applications with Dash Enterprise. Throughout this transition, Plotly has continued to support the organization in making the best product decisions to meet its evolving needs.

RTD offers several web applications that make it possible for passengers to  plan their transit routes. One RTD service, called Access-a-Ride, provides bus  transportation for passengers with disabilities. \"Dash really accelerated our product development. It met our need to ideate and move to production quickly, getting the final product into our customers’ hands much faster than it would have with a different approach.\" Systems Administrator, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Denver RTD IT system developers planned to deliver a customer portal for the  service, but delays from an incumbent software vendor led the team to consider building the solution themselves. Python-savvy members of the team started developing a prototype. Dash’s  Python framework enabled the data-driven application to support rich, geospatial mapping to give passengers accurate views of their routes and  drop-off times from their mobile devices. Importantly, because Dash is open-source, the team  was able to make necessary adjustments to ensure their customer portal was  accessible as per WCAG 2.x standards.  The prototype received positive feedback from management, and the team quickly moved the customer portal into production, where it would help  passengers on over 2,000 daily trips. During beta testing, the portal received a lot of feedback, which the team was able to incorporate easily and quickly, often  pushing out changes within the same day. The Access-a-Ride Customer Portal is built with Dash and provides an interactive, mobile-responsive user interface for RTD passengers in the Denver Metropolitan area. With Dash chosen as the framework for the Access-a-Ride customer portal, other RTD developers began building Dash applications for new use cases in internal data management. By deploying Dash applications within internal operations, different teams could easily visualize and explore the wealth of data that comes with operating metropolitan transportation systems across 2,300 square miles.  In the dispatch dashboard, late trip events are flagged in the data table, alerting dispatchers, who can then manage vehicle logistics accordingly. Developers enhanced the dashboard with AVL playback to visualize point-in-time vehicle tracking and facilitate research into customer complaints.

        "content": "AI in Dash Enterprise — save your spot for tomorrow's  launch event session ! Industries IoT Summary DOWNLOAD PDF You’ve heard of driverless cars and delivery drones, but what about humongous drills? Tunnel boring machines (TBMs) move through the earth beneath some of the planet’s busiest cities and have recently joined the list of tech that “thinks” for itself. The world’s first autonomous tunnel boring machine (A-TBM) was developed in early 2019 by Gamuda Berhad, one of Malaysia’s largest infrastructure companies. Some of their key accomplishments include the world’s first Stormwater Management and Road Tunnel (SMART) which houses a motorway and stormwater drain, and the tunneling for Malaysia’s first mass rapid transit (MRT) system. At the heart of major projects like these are TBMs capable of drilling large tunnels six meters (20 feet) in diameter beneath the earth’s surface. A-TBMs are outfitted with different sensors that collect data and enable operators to program drilling to a very precise level — they can measure within one millimetre of accuracy. While drilling, the A-TBM has a margin of error of 100 millimetres, in which much can go wrong: public trust, project success, expensive equipment, and personnel safety are all at stake. \"We are committed to advancing innovation in tunnel boring, and ‘fail fast’ is our mantra. Python and Dash let us experiment quickly to find solutions that really please people and add value to what Gamuda can offer.\" John Lim Ji Xiong, Excellence Transformation Team Lead, Gamuda In the tunnel boring industry, several incumbent software systems are commonly used. When A-TBM development began in mid-2018, John Lim Ji Xiong, a senior R&D engineer, started using the Plotly Python graphing library to interactively chart data analyses that he could share with his management. As the lead of Gamuda’s Tunnel R&D team, John was on the lookout for new and better approaches. By 2019, John and the R&D team knew they wanted to create their own custom software to track and monitor TBMs as they drilled underground. “The existing software we bought was expensive and didn’t give us the insight we wanted. The interface was old and clunky, not based on React. It was hard to graph a chart, for example, and it took a long time to plot a simple X and Y axis. We wanted something we would really love and appreciate internally.” The R&D team, all mechanical engineers conversant in Python, quickly developed an awareness and appreciation for  Dash , which John discovered while visiting the Plotly website. A basic pain point of the legacy software affected everyday operations at a human level. The existing solution was only available on a single computer in the office, and each phone call from management requesting information on location, timing, or speed required someone to get up, go to the computer station, search for, and compile the information. This made progress reporting very difficult. The team wanted to make it much easier for A-TBM operators and management to access current drilling data whenever and wherever they were, whether at home, in the office, or at the A-TBM itself. Another pain point was advanced monitoring. As an advancement from  simply graphing A-TBM sensor data, the R&D team wanted to develop  algorithms that would identify trends and patterns. The existing solution’s vendor  indicated that such customizations would be costly and required six to 12 months to  deliver—time enough for Gamuda to have already finished a significant  amount of tunneling work. Faced with these challenges, the R&D team wasn’t convinced that they  couldn’t produce something better for themselves.  By the time John’s team discovered Dash, most of the drilling at their active project site was complete. Two of the 10 TBMs were still active, with 10-15 tunnel engineers and on-site staff requiring access to insights pieced together through so many phone calls and runs to the single computer station. To deliver an innovative analytic solution to this relatively small audience in a short period of time, the R&D team knew they were limited to their present resources and Python knowledge. “The easiest thing to pick up and learn was Dash,” said John. “It helped us to build things fast, and we were able to test ideas ourselves instead of paying a vendor to do it. We could take an idea, try it, and within a day or a week, we’d have something.” In John’s case, that something began to pay off. Dash enabled the team to take a speedy, fail-fast approach to solving important problems. For example, damage to the drill head is expensive and delays progress. Engineers inside the body of the A-TBM can often hear a particular noise when the part is damaged. The team thought microphones or vibration sensors positioned behind the bulkhead could provide useful data inputs to enable a more predictive maintenance approach. However, they struggled to gain good data from these sensor types. Knowing this, they moved on to another approach. This time, they used Dash to track in real time how much torque was detected by sensors in the drill head. As the project neared completion, drilling operators noticed more breakdowns occurring. Retrospectively comparing these breakdowns to the data indicated that the Dash application had picked up spikes in the data correlating with subsequent breakdowns. Due to shift changes, drill operators were missing the “big picture” in the data over time. The team presented this finding to management, who were pleased with the lesson learned and have since been updating the Dash application to detect and flag these spikes for future projects. Drilling operations in dense urban areas also take into account Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data from nearby buildings to prevent structural damage and disruption. Gamuda’s solution, built with Dash, takes advantage of modular visualization components that enable them to create mapping and real-time charting of A-TBM sensor data and progress. Momentum from the project led to the creation of a new, organization-wide innovation outfit, the Gamuda Excellence Transformation team (GET), which John now leads. Gamuda continues to make incremental changes like these that improve their Dash interface with A-TBM operations. The company is already bidding for future projects where systems that include their Dash application capabilities will be much more than a “nice-to-have.” They see Dash as adding value and differentiation to these bids, where Gamuda is able to propose their own bespoke solutions that incorporate not only sensor and drill tracking but also environmental and resourcing analytics. Gamuda Berhad is an engineering, property, and infrastructure company based in Malaysia. It is one of the largest Malaysian infrastructure companies, with a proven track record of delivering innovative  breakthrough solutions worldwide.

        "content": "AI in Dash Enterprise — save your spot for tomorrow's  launch event session ! Industries Artificial Intelligence Summary DOWNLOAD PDF Crant is a creative artificial intelligence company known for being thought leaders in data-driven marketing analytics, with recent wins for the Webby and the Anthem Awards. The company’s primary focus is on helping brands harness AI to grow their relevance in the most competitive markets.  Marketing teams are shifting focus from performance marketing to brand build- ing and actively seeking ways to incorporate AI for insight-generation. Crant’s solution, InkLantern, helps these teams measure the impact of their brand marketing efforts with metrics such as the proprietary “Brand Love”, which offers a daily overview of brand attractiveness by tracking post volume, interactions, and comment sentiment, incorporating a lookback period of several weeks.  One of Crant’s main goals was to reduce the time spent creating highly custom dashboards and to integrate OpenAI chatbot features to enhance user interaction. This need led the team to adopting Dash Enterprise to build tailored and scalable dashboards with greater efficiency. Brand tracker dashboard: the Brand Love performance tracking view within the InkLantern platform. “With Dash Enterprise, our efficiency skyrocketed. We slashed 28 hours of complex analysis time each week, helping Marketing teams focus on creating stronger brands. We were able to provide AI driven recommendations to each customer through NLP and Computer Vision analysis based on massive social media datasets. And, the insights we've gained are mind-boggling — visualizing Brand Love from various angles. We're now on a continuous growth trajectory, replicating dashboards effortlessly.” Alvaro Melendez, Co-Founder & CEO, Crant Brand performance is  notoriously difficult  to quantify and measure. The analytics team at Crant needed to build a dynamic tool offering AI insights, enabling their customers to better analyze large amounts of social media data and ultimately calculate the ROI of marketing investments in brand building.  As the company’s customer base and global recognition continued to rapidly grow, the Crant team began creating highly customized dashboards for individual clients. The process of customizing dashboards for each user quickly became repetitive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale as the company continued to grow. The team faced challenges working with disparate large datasets across platforms, multimedia, and sentiments hidden within engagements and reactions.  Google’s Looker Studio, their previous tool for creating these interactive dashboards, lagged behind in accommodating the ever-changing sentiment data as well as fluctuations in high-volume social media engagement data representing multiple industries.  Crant needed a comprehensive solution that could empower the company to build custom dashboards that combined disparate, unstructured data from different platforms at scale and allowed customers to access and interact with the detailed results of brand sentiment analysis. With a strategic switch to Dash Enterprise, Crant built InkLantern — an AI platform showcasing dynamic dashboards — for visualizing data and automating the deployment of multiple customer-specific dashboards.

In the same screen, you can see KPIs across all our asset types and you can drill down very efficiently. It allows us to create trust and transparency with our customers, who get to see what our engineers are recording and writing in real time.” Alban Jéhu, Product Owner of WPO Dashboard WPO is the leading independent service provider in the EU and UK for renewable investors. With origins in wind prospect operations, WPO’s portfolio has expanded to hydropower plants, solar parks, wind farms, and battery storage sites around the world. This graph, powered by the Plotly Python graphing library, updates regularly to show WPO’s last 48 hours of data flows. To provide excellent, differentiated service to their clients, WPO coordinates across multiple stakeholders and diverse data systems to provide secure, relevant views of real-time advanced analytics on asset health and performance. These insights are then shown to the clients through their comprehensive Dashboard platform, which they built with Python and Dash. WPO Dashboard is available with single sign-on on mobile and desktop devices for easy access, anytime, to the latest KPI updates and data flows. WPO’s Dashboard solution is the platform on which WPO orchestrates its services, and it serves as both an internal tool and an external portal for clients. Over 40 customized dashboards, reports, and web applications built in Python with Dash ensure a unified, data-driven experience for site operators, maintenance crews, investors, and WPO’s managers. The platform’s diversity, enabled by Dash, gives it extraordinary versatility and proves to be performant after two years of battle testing. “Using the wide range of Dash features like JavaScript, Python, pattern matching callbacks, and the vast set of components available, there is virtually no business case for which we cannot build a fit-for-purpose app. We can focus our efforts on careful data management and processing and trust Dash for fast, robust app development.” Joachim Audouard, Lead Developer at WPO For WPO’s wind farm clients, WPO’s Dashboard solution has been critical for resolving unnecessary impediments to energy production. Wind farm operators must respect environmental and safety regulations and navigate changeable external factors like weather, seasonality, and hardware limitations, all while maximizing energy production. Turbine manufacturers often hard-code curtailments into a turbine’s control software, which restrict its operation according to specific requirements, such as noise limits during certain hours or a cap on energy output to prevent the grid from overloading. These are meant to facilitate a wind farm’s compliance with regulations, but operators have experienced negative repercussions when the software is not up-to-date with current regulations. WPO’s curtailment analytics provide an evidentiary counterpoint to help resolve these issues. WPO’s Dashboard curtailment analysis Dash app is a nice use case for Dash’s pattern-matching callbacks and classification algorithms. \"You always need a contradictory analysis. We offer a systematic analysis at an affordable price and in a completely independent way. By monitoring effectively how the turbines behave and perform, we provide our customers with evidence of whether anything should or shouldn’t be curtailed and whether it is. This is highly appreciated when it comes to discussion with turbine manufacturers or authorities.” Alexandre Bertrand, Managing Director at WPO Some curtailments should apply only under specific environmental conditions, like a certain range of temperatures or wind speeds, or only at specific times of the day or year. WPO’s Python analysis checks clients’ turbine data against 15 criteria to determine if any “zombie curtailments” may be unnecessarily impacting a turbine’s performance. Leveraging Python and Dash versatility, WPO’s team was able to build out a wind curtailments application around this analysis, giving managers, operators, and investors intuitive access to the same insights despite varying rules, conditions, and on-site systems for all the wind turbines.  Furthermore, other Dash applications grant views for high-level revenue KPIs or turbine-level conditions, or even for assets’ customer invoice management — there’s a Dash app for every stakeholder level. The extensive availability of such rich and usable data has real payoffs. Getting comprehensive, up-to-the-minute visibility on everything from machine data and environmental conditions to revenue and production impacts has enabled some WPO clients to define more efficient curtailment strategies, all of which result in an AEP (Annual Energy Production) increase of up to two percent. It also facilitates close cooperation with turbine manufacturers on turbine software updates that benefit the wind industry as a whole. Additionally, the WPO Dashboard also makes it easy to proactively assess if a wind farm is infringing on any curtailments and equips operators and investors with the information they need to address an issue before it reaches a costly litigation or shutdown. As an independent firm, WPO required tools that would provide a lean but impactful way to deliver advanced analytics across a diverse portfolio for an array of stakeholder needs. Python and Dash fit that need by abstracting away the work of building complex user interfaces while still enabling WPO to create tailored, custom applications specific to renewable asset management. The result is a robust suite of fit-for-purpose applications that distinguish WPO's services from the competition by optimizing clients’ operating strategies, helping reduce costly risks, and ensuring a competitive place for renewable energy in the market. Founded in 2008, WPO provides specialist services for over 6 GW of wind, solar, hydro and storage assets in 11 countries with 90 employees present in 36 service points.

Industries Renewable Energy Summary DOWNLOAD PDF The U.S.  National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)  is a leader in the effort to develop more efficient and cost-effective ways of harnessing wind energy. NREL research software engineers are producing impactful, open-source data and tools for fellow researchers and wind farm operators across the public and private sectors. These resources make wind energy science more accessible to industry with the goal of optimizing wind farm operations, reducing costs and maximizing annual energy production (AEP). “Dash allows us to adjust model parameters directly in the application and rerun them in real time. This has helped us build an intuition for exactly how parameters affect the model. Whereas the typical process for understanding a new model can take many days, using Dash enables us to get visual feedback and understand a model within a single day.” Rafael Mudafort, FLORIS software engineer, NREL A novel wind farm control method termed “wake steering” is an approach that turns select wind turbines away from the incoming wind to allow downstream turbines that would otherwise be impacted by the wake to produce more power. While wake steering has been gaining attention in the research community over the past decade, there are important barriers to its adoption, including uncertainty around the physical impact that it can have on expensive wind turbine equipment over time. Wake steering can increase annual energy production and reduce the cost of production by strategically redirecting wind turbine wakes. Visualization tools like FLORIS help accelerate research into this practice and its impacts.  NREL’s wind farm controls simulation tool, called FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State ( FLORIS ), enables end users to quickly and interactively explore wind turbine wake models to optimize wind farm layouts and controls. NREL has made the tool public so that the global open source community can use and adapt it. Hundreds of researchers at organizations including the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the National Offshore Wind Research and Development Consortium have adopted FLORIS in their own work.  Working in Python and Dash, a single engineer built the FLORIS app, using Dash’s modular, component-based framework to prototype the custom interface within a span of days and produce a complete app in weeks. FLORIS, now widely consulted by NREL stakeholders across the organization, extends the capability to explore and run the models beyond the initial group of domain experts.  To aid in data preprocessing, NREL software engineers built a custom interface using Dash DataTable and other visualization components, giving end users the ability to adjust their parameters and immediately view the effects. FLORIS can visualize model outputs for aggregate annual atmospheric conditions across more than 100 wind turbines within seconds. In February 2022, a new release boosted FLORIS’ calculation speed by 300 times that of the previous version. FLORIS visualizes a year’s worth of anemometer to capture prevailing wind speed and direction at the site of a potential new wind farm. Researchers can adjust individual parameters directly in the interactive table when turbine blades or farm control software are updated and rerun the optimization models. Ongoing research at NREL and in the private sector is expanding the body of knowledge around wake steering, with some impressive results. According to a 2021 mid-year performance report, NREL analyzed millions of FLORIS simulations and uncovered new wind power opportunities across regions in the U.S. previously considered less than ideal for production due geography and wind resourcing. The analysis indicated that wake steering optimization could surmount these challenges and increase potential annual energy production (AEP) at these sites by up to 2.5%. Such AEP gains at a single 10,000-megawatt wind farm would power an additional 8,000 homes in North America. Major manufacturers have begun thinking ahead about wake steering and its implications for future turbine design, and some are using FLORIS in their analyses.  NREL regularly updates FLORIS with new features for use cases such as offshore wind farms, where the added complexities of waves and tides must be considered, and hybrid wind farms that capture solar as well as wind energy. As NREL continues building its research tools for the future of energy, the versatility of Dash Enterprise will keep pace.

By accelerating innovation in the produce aisle with bioinformatics and molecular sequencing pipelines powered by Python and Dash Enterprise, Pairwise is preparing to bring new brands of tastier, healthier, and more consistently available produce to market. “Dash Enterprise has allowed our team to expand and deliver a 10x scalability increase in our molecular screening pipeline. This incredible increase has demonstrated critical ROI and supported the rapid acceleration of our innovative Fulcrum™ platform.” Zoe Cesarz, Associate Director, Software Engineering at Pairwise Driven by their mission of building a healthier world through better fruits and vegetables, Pairwise identified the need for their teams of highly skilled geneticists, molecular biologists, and software engineers to create a solution purpose-built for their innovative product portfolio.  The 5-year-old company turned to Dash Enterprise to enable a seamless partnership between its experienced scientists and its bench of tech applications. These mission-critical scientific processes are complex and challenging to scale at a rapidly growing company.  Three core pillars drove Pairwise to Dash Enterprise from its previous, bespoke applications platform:  Using  Dash Enterprise , Pairwise’s software development team created four applications to support their genetic screening operations from end to end. This molecular identification step is key to Pairwise’s fast-paced innovation pipeline because it identifies the effect of Pairwise’s technology in creating new products. As their experiment needs scaled, Pairwise’s teams worked to integrate liquid handlers alongside their manual laboratory processes as a form of digital labor. They developed a Dash app that seamlessly integrates human and scientific processes and hardware interactions to go back and forth. This enabled a transition to automated processing from 5% to 80% of their total scientific effort. With Dash Enterprise, Pairwise’s team has enabled more than 10 experiment design types ranging from five to 2,000 samples per experiment.

Industries Pharmaceutical Summary DOWNLOAD PDF A billion-dollar pharmaceutical company was using Dash to implement  machine learning  in its research and development of new treatments for genetic disorders and infectious diseases. In April 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic raged across the globe, the company jumped to action and developed a Dash application for screening the efficacy of thousands of drug compounds against SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the disease. The Dash application was deployed online, where users could filter results to view data plots that abstracted away thousands of parameters to illustrate the success of each compound against the virus in vitro. This speedy visualization and socialization of thousands of results, including microscopy images, was followed by the release of a research preprint four months later, facilitating open data access across the research community. Clinical trial data can be explored, curated, and reported through a web-based Dash application like this example, which is  available as a template application . The pharmaceutical company’s platform applies machine learning models to millions of images collected each week from laboratory settings. The models are constantly learning about and adjusting the biology of the drug discovery process. To enable the iterative learning loop behind their platform’s success, the models must update regularly with new information, such as changes observed in a cell wall when a new compound is introduced. Intensive machine learning operations like these require highly custom software tools. That’s why the company chose Dash, which enabled their software development team to create tailored tools for each experiment’s specific lab conditions, drug compounds, and disease models. The team started using open-source Dash to quickly develop analytic applications. Dash’s Python framework was well suited for automated processes and machine learning. The team could quickly prototype, iterate on, and deploy fully functional web-based applications in days or weeks instead of months. Dash had become a go-to framework for developing tools for the company’s platform. Shortly after, the company decided to invest in Dash Enterprise, opening up capabilities to easily and securely manage and embed their Dash applications in their existing infrastructure without disrupting well-established processes. A Dash Enterprise license ensured that the team was quickly onboarded to the platform, where they could easily deploy, manage, and share their apps from the  App Manager  portal.  Embedding middleware  capabilities ensured that the company’s Dash applications could be deployed on their existing platform, and Plotly engaged the company to develop support for existing identity management infrastructure. This ensured users seamless access to the applications using their existing credentials — no need for  re-authentication  or multiple sign-ons. Licensing Dash Enterprise also provided low-code capabilities to accelerate development time. On-demand creation of printable and interactive PDF and email reports, triggered reporting of point-in-time application views, and annotation are all included in Dash Enterprise. Themes, layouts, and templates make it easy to produce applications that meet the organization’s  look and feel  without having to consult a designer or front-end developer. Plotly’s open-source standard for analytic apps in Python gets 10M+ monthly downloads and is used by 50M+ users worldwide. Dash Enterprise is our analytic platform built on the OSS. Companies typically switch over because it’s more team friendly: it’s a low-code solution built for data scientists  and  the wider team.  Dash Enterprise DOCS COMPANY WE ARE HIRING Galleries Integrations"

Dash offers a customizable framework that empowers our modern Data Science & Analytics team to effectively communicate insights, using Python-centric development.” Brian White, Digital Product Manager at Komatsu Komatsu's Analytics team faced challenges in developing complex data applications for their customers, when the requirements surpassed the capabilities of lower-code tools. The team is built around core competencies in Python and SQL, not traditional front-end frameworks. There were a number of use cases, each with unique challenges.  One of the more unusual datasets for visualization comes from vibration condition monitoring kits installed on electric mining shovels. Each data collection produces a waveform-and-spectrum pair of arrays that did not fit cleanly into any of Komatsu’s no-code visualization tools, like Grafana and  PowerBI . The team sought a solution for advanced, customized data visualization, combined with a variety of highly customized analysis cursors and widgets. This was beyond the capabilities of existing tools.  Additionally, Komatsu required a more flexible tool for public-facing marketing use cases to demonstrate global fleet connectivity. Customization limitations in existing tools became apparent, hindering even basic elements like a corporate-standard font or custom mapping with unique Komatsu-developed icons.  In response, the team turned to Dash Enterprise, shortening the time required for application development while addressing data and design challenges. Komatsu tackled their challenges across four major use cases, each addressing distinct value propositions.  The  Customer Experience Center  application aimed to illustrate a connected global fleet of equipment using marketing digital assets, including custom icons and fonts. The team used Dash's broader ecosystem of libraries, particularly the Leaflet Dash integration, to make almost anything possible in a Python framework. Direct  Snowflake  queries ensured live data updates for this marketing dashboard used to display Komatsu’s footprint across the globe.  This dashboard is on public display at Komatsu’s South Harbor campus lobby in Milwaukee, WI. The Customer Experience Center application aimed to illustrate a connected global fleet of equipment using marketing digital assets, including custom icons and fonts. The second application, a  Vibration Data Viewer , handled custom vibration waveform and spectrum data beyond the capabilities of traditional BI tools.

        "content": "AI in Dash Enterprise — save your spot for tomorrow's  launch event session ! Industries Supply Chain Summary DOWNLOAD PDF The  NISCI (Ningbo Institute for Supply Chain Innovation) , an integral part of  MIT's global SCALE network , is a research center dedicated to supply chain management and logistics. The institute focuses on academic instruction and practical applications in collaboration with industry partners, spanning government entities, corporations, and organizations. A core component of the NISCI's work is the optimization of supply chain networks, typically for manufacturing and logistics firms. The institute develops solutions that tackle classic optimization challenges, such as plant and warehouse location decisions, sourcing decisions, and more. The research also extends to logistics solutions, such as truck routing and trailer loading, or leveraging AI and machine learning to estimate vessel arrival times at specific ports. The NISCI develops visualizations for its supply chain and logistics solutions in their local  Computational and Visual Education (CAVE) Lab , and relies on Dash Enterprise to develop and deploy interactive applications and visualizations in a fast and efficient manner. “Without the visualization provided by Dash Enterprise, these projects would merely be some Python scripts we would hand over to the client, and they would have to build their own visualizations. We can now deliver not only algorithms, but actual products — the project partner doesn't have to do anything other than work with us on their data pipeline.” Pascal Wolf, Assistant Professor, NISCI The research team at NISCI faced challenges in communicating the results of their machine learning and optimization algorithms to their project partners.  The NISCI works on complex shipping and logistics cases, such as scenario planning with multiple parameters or determining the implications of a 10% increase in transportation costs. Visualizing these solutions at times felt like navigating a black box, making it challenging for practitioners to analyze and interpret the results. The research team wanted to increase transparency and strengthen trust in the solutions they provided to project partners.  The team at NISCI realized that interactive visualization and analysis provided a boost in transparency by allowing project partners to deeply understand the underlying data. They aimed to create visualizations atop their optimization algorithms to make the solutions more accessible and engaging for practitioners, aiding in their understanding of the end results.  The research team initially turned to Matplotlib for basic visualization, which was powerful yet lacked support for building highly interactive visualizations or full-fledged applications. When they discovered Plotly’s Dash, they found it could facilitate quick development in Python of such applications, but without the requirement of a dedicated software development or IT team — enabling a streamlined solution for creating full-featured data apps to package their optimization models as complete, interactive data.  Over a period of just two weeks, the team successfully deployed their first data applications. Based on this initial success with Dash, they began to explore Dash Enterprise, particularly for optimizing processes in the realm of container loading. The NISCI team, with expertise in supply chain management rather than computer science, found it relatively easy to adopt Dash Enterprise in developing data applications for their project partners. They were able to create their own library of custom templates to save time, despite being a small team of three researchers.  The team developed two key applications, the first being a solution for LCL (Less than Container Load) loading, and the second, a multi-channel distribution design application. NISCI's LCL loading application gives users the ability to create container loading plans with visual loading instructions. The LCL loading app empowers logistics companies to create efficient container loading plans and to obtain visual loading instructions. Users can easily upload data containing cargo details, box dimensions, and weights via spreadsheets. In the background, NISCI's optimization algorithm ensures optimal placement of each SKU on the palettes, box stacking configurations, and container layout for efficient space utilization. A comprehensive interactive workflow guides workers on the shop floor for more organized plan execution. The multi-channel distribution design application ensures an optimal approach to revamping the distribution network and accommodating evolving business needs. The app handled assessing and enhancing delivery performance, analyzing more than 18 months of records holding nearly 2 million order lines, customer orders, inbound data, and warehouse activities. It incorporated machine learning algorithms to generate insights on actual delivery times versus planned delivery times and the reasons behind delivery delays, based on customer ordering patterns. The multi-channel distribution design application provides an optimal approach for planning distribution networks to improve delivery metrics. The multi-channel distribution design app was developed in collaboration with a Fortune 500 company seeking to transform their distribution network in Australia and New Zealand, in response to increased demand and a shift from traditional B2B to a more B2C-oriented business model. The NISCI team eventually added simulation capabilities to this app, allowing users to identify optimal locations for order fulfillment, minimizing transportation costs and enhancing customer service by improving the next day delivery capabilities by more than 12%, measured in terms of Sales per day of lead time. Discover how NISCI (Ningbo Institute for Supply Chain Innovation) transformed their supply chain operations with Dash Enterprise  at our upcoming webinar . NISCI is a non-profit educational and research institute that operates independently under the guidance of the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics and is the only research institute jointly established by MIT and the Chinese government.

        "content": "AI in Dash Enterprise — save your spot for tomorrow's  launch event session ! Industries Research Summary DOWNLOAD PDF Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) is managed by the University of California for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science. Scientists and developers from multiple divisions at Berkeley Lab have built a core infrastructure to support worldwide collaboration on a suite of open-source tools that are accelerating materials science research around the world. Inventing innovative materials to address the world’s energy challenges is incredibly time-insensitive and costly. Solar cells, batteries, and lasers are some of the key technologies that utilize special crystalline materials. Identifying and making new crystalline materials in a lab setting is excruciatingly long. As an example, gallium nitride, the material used in LED lighting, is the product of several decades of research before commercialization was possible! Calculating even the basic properties of these materials requires extensive quantum physics calculations; without resources like a supercomputer, the right software, and broad access to data, progress is slow. The Materials Project  brings the required resources together in a single, free, open-source platform, where researchers who might not have access to all the necessities can benefit from pre-computed data. Over the last decade, a large, multi-institution collaboration of scientists and researchers across the world coalesced into the project as it stands today, where over 200,000 registered users have access to applications for exploring and analyzing nearly 150,000 different inorganic materials.  The core infrastructure staff consists of four individuals who administer the project’s website, API, and database infrastructure while also creating new tools for hundreds of thousands of users — no easy task. The small team leveraged the power of Python and Dash as an efficient and accessible way to tackle the work.  The project website itself is a Dash application written in Python. This approach eliminated the need for a full-stack web development team and capitalized on the Python skill sets of the team’s materials science researchers. A previous version of the website had been built with the Django framework, but with only a single web developer on the team, adding new front end features was slow. Switching to the Dash framework enabled the entire team to contribute to the website using Python and set the stage for end users to contribute their own applications as well. The Materials Explorer is one of over a dozen interactive Dash apps available for use by the global materials science community via the Materials Project website. Fourteen applications for data exploration and analysis are available on the project website. Furthermore, the project team also open-sourced their  own library of Dash components , giving researchers the ability to more easily create their own applications using analytics and user interface components specific to the domain of materials science.  The team has also used Dash to develop a user contribution framework for the website, enabling scientists around the world to upload their own data on new crystal structures they have discovered; an automated Python pipeline performs the requisite quantum physics calculations, identifies and corrects errors, and exports the data to a database that all users can freely download to further their own research. Running 100 million CPU hours each year, the project has helped the global research community screen through nearly 150,000 fundamental new materials and nearly 25,000 molecules for use in technologies such as new batteries. Because Dash is a Python framework, the Materials Project benefits from leveraging the broader Python ecosystem in its tooling. This reduces the time costs of innovation and connects materials science domain experts more directly with tool development and data sharing. Since its creation, peer-reviewed publications associated with the project have been cited in research over 19,000 times and have helped foster collaborations across the public and private sectors. Applications in areas including carbon capture, better battery technology, and energy-efficient cooling and heating suggest an optimistic role for open-source science in addressing climate change and its impacts.

Industries Pharmaceutical Summary DOWNLOAD PDF Since 2007, the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS) has pursued a vision to build an evidence base for positive health in Singapore and globally. The national research institute launched two longitudinal cohort studies that have spanned over a decade’s worth of maternal and child health data — Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) & Singapore Preconception Study of Long-Term Maternal and Child Outcomes (S-PRESTO). SICS is building digital, interactive ways for the research community to leverage those data in the design of future studies, with help from Python and Dash Enterprise. \"The beauty and strength of the GUSTO study is that it spans multiple health domains. Having an open, interactive platform that showcases all the data and sample sizes that are available allows us to empower researchers to collaborate and form hypotheses linking multiple phenotypes.\" Mukkesh Kumar - Data Science Manager, Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences The study objectives require a comprehensive, multi-domain approach to gain insight into the long-term health impacts of conditions during pregnancy and early childhood. There was also a need to enable SICS researchers and collaborators to build their own research questions from the data. Several hurdles complicated these goals: The data science team at SICS was tasked with building a full-service data vault from which researchers could search the cohort data catalogs, read published research, and explore the data through interactive visualizations. To accomplish this, the data science team would develop multiple data apps, accessible in the web browser to enable wider access for the research community. The team already worked with Python and the Dash Open Source framework, so they could build the data apps themselves without web development technicalities. But managing all the data apps for a full-service platform with global reach became technically challenging and time-consuming, detracting from the actual data science work. Committed to creating this resource for the research community, the team licensed Dash Enterprise to further streamline and accelerate their work to build and manage the data vault platform. The data catalogue screen from the SICS full-service data vault Mobile-friendly data app for global reach Collaboration and speed : Within one month, the data science team can ideate and iterate on a new data app in collaboration with SICS clinicians and domain experts, test the app, and deploy it to their data vault platform. Dash Enterprise provides control over user accesses, permissions and app management, helping teams work together, faster. Engaged research community : User analytics in 2022 suggest the data vault sees around 5,500 unique visitors in a year, mostly from Singapore, although 20% are based in countries across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. These viewers spend an average of 20 minutes at a time on the platform, suggesting that the platform is promoting engagement with the cohort data. Furthering global research : The platform is a rich, interactive means of accessing and exploring the GUSTO and S-PRESTO cohort data, encouraging curiosity and prompting further questions. Functionality like a sample size calculator enable researchers to see what samples are available before building a research question and cohort on that knowledge. The platform indexes over 300 publications, including articles in Nature and Oxford University’s Human Reproduction, and has garnered interest from leading research groups around the world, as well as other institutions within the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). Founded in 2007, the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences’ (SICS) mission is to promote health and human capacity in Singapore, Asia, and globally. The first institute within the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) to focus on clinical sciences and translational research, SICS posits that health has its origins in good beginnings and continued interactions between our physiological makeup and environment. The institute strongly promotes clinical research that supports the understanding of metabolism, neuroscience and how they impact human development.
